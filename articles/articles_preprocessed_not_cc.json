{"article":{"0":"\"How About You Amaze Me\": Simone Biles' Dig At USA Gymnastics In Birthday Tweet | Gymnastics News Four-time Olympic gold medallist Simone Biles wants more than good wishes from USA Gymnastics. The US federation wished Biles a happy 23rd birthday on social media on Saturday. Biles -- who also owns 19 world titles and is expected to be among the stars of the Tokyo Olympics -- used their tweet as a chance to demand an independent investigation into the Larry Nassar sex abuse scandal. \"how about you amaze me and do the right thing ... have an independent investigation,\" Biles snapped on Twitter after the federation's birthday tweet.\n\n\"HAPPY BIRTHDAY to the most decorated gymnast of all time, @simonebiles!\" USA Gymnastics wrote, posting a video of Biles in action in a floor exercise. \"We know you will only continue to amaze us and make history!\"\n\nFormer national gymnastics team doctor Nassar was jailed for life for abusing more than 250 athletes, including stars of the United States' 2012 and 2016 gold medal-winning Olympic teams.\n\nA US Senate investigation found that \"multiple institutions\" failed to adequately respond to credible allegations against Nassar, but Biles has said that USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic and Paralympic Committee still owe his victims, including herself, more answers and a framework to ensure such abuses won't occur again.\n\n\"Wish they BOTH wanted an independent investigation as much as the survivors & I do,\" she tweeted earlier this month.\n\nAs Biles and other elite gymnasts ramp up their preparations for Tokyo, USA Gymnastics in January offered a $215 million (194 million euros) settlement to victims of Nassar to settle legal claims -- a plan a lawyer for more than 200 women called \"unconscionable.\"\n\nOlympic gold medallist Aly Raisman, who is now retired, called the settlement offer \"offensive\" and accused the federation of attempting to prevent release of details which would show how Nassar was able to abuse athletes for years.\n\nAttorney John Manley, who represents more than 180 clients with active claims against USA Gymnastics, said the settlement offer releases too many people from further claims, including the USOPC, former USA Gymnastics chief Steve Penny and former national team directors Bela and Marta Karolyi.","1":"\"India Still Maybe Best Travelling Team In The World\": Brian Lara | Cricket News West Indies legend Brian Lara feels that India are still the best travelling team in Test cricket despite their recent 2-0 defeat in New Zealand. India had lost the first Test by 10 wickets and the second by seven with their batting lineup looking all at sea in all four innings. Lara considers what happened in New Zealand an \"aberration.\" \"I think India have been travelling very well in the last ten or so years. What happened in New Zealand, I think it's more of an aberration, I think coming off so much one-day and T20 cricket, it might have been tough for them in the Test arena outside of India. But I think India is still maybe the best travelling team in the world,\" Lara told ESPNCricinfo.\n\nLara said that West Indies and India would be two teams that Australia will be worried about the most at the T20 World Cup later in the year. \"In terms of a team, obviously I want to see the West Indies go all the way and win,\" said Lara.\n\n\"India, with the fact that they produce so much international cricketers through their league (Indian Premier League) has enhanced every single player who plays for India. I mean KL Rahul is my favourite player in the world, I love watching him and I think India is going to be a force to reckon with.\n\n\"Australia at home... it's not going to be an easy World Cup for anyone. Australia is going to be worried about India and the West Indies, West Indies are going to be worried about everybody because of their inconsistency sometimes. So it's going to be a great World Cup to look at.\"","2":"$199 - Dallas: 5-Star Summer Stay w\/Parking, 40% Off Guests can also indulge in a world-renowned cuisine at legendary Japanese restaurant Nobu, just off the lobby, or experience members-only-style dining at the private Crescent Club restaurant\n\nSure, Hotel Crescent Court sits among the high-end shops and restaurants of Uptown within Dallas's ultra-hip Arts District, but we're pretty confident you won't want to set foot outside: The hotel offers a veritable laundry list of amenities, from custom clothing services to an impressive array of group fitness classes -- think yoga, weight training and spin -- on top of a rooftop pool set in a lavish Renaissance-style courtyard.\n\nThe hotel itself feels palatial thanks to its chateau-esque exterior and lofty marble-and-limestone lobby. The upscale vibe extends to the guest rooms, too, where you'll find touches like marble bathrooms with light-up vanities and terrycloth robes along with Italian linens on the beds, Nespresso coffee makers and enormous 55-inch flat-screen TVs. For a better view, we recommend upgrading to a Premier room or one of the suites -- those also come with large soaking tubs.\n\nThere are five restaurants on site, ranging from Tex-Mex classics, sandwiches and salads served with garden views at the glass-enclosed Conservatory to a private dining in the oak-paneled Crescent Club (open to hotel guests only). However, the real standout here is Nobu, where you can sample distinctly Texan dishes like Ranchero-style rib-eye steak alongside the restaurants flagship dishes like black cod miso and rock shrimp tempura.","3":"$69 & up - Whistler Village Stays into September, up to 40% Off Heated year-round outdoor pool, indoor hot tub and dry sauna are a few of the hotel's amenities\n\nWhistler Village Inn & Suites arguably has one of the best locations in Whistler, steps from boutiques, restaurants and bars.

The episode will feature Judge Lola Carmichael (Missick) virtually presiding over a bench trial. The episode will simultaneously examine the characters' personal lives within the series as they continue their personal and professional lives while staying indoors.\n\nThe episode will air Monday, May 4.\n\n\"It's a unique chance for our \"All Rise\" family to band together -- in our different homes, even cities -- to tell a story about resilience, justice and the power of community,\" executive producer Greg Spottiswood said in a statement.\n\nVirtual footage will be shot in each of the series regular's homes and producers plan to use VFX to create the necessary backgrounds. Filming will be done via FaceTime, WebEX, Zoom, and other social media platforms and technologies.

The Marvel and Disney sequel earned a staggering $187.7 million in its debut weekend, making it the second biggest U.S. opening of all time according to Rentrak estimates Sunday.\n\nBut \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" failed to top the all-time record of the first film's $207.4 million debut in 2012.\n\nAlthough \"Ultron\" was the only new film in wide release this weekend, it had some significant small screen competition: The Kentucky Derby, the NBA playoffs, and the Floyd Mayweather Jr. and Manny Pacquiao fight.\n\nNumbers could shift by the time Monday actuals roll in, but it seems the robust counter-programming may have blockaded another record for Marvel and Disney.\n\nStill, for Disney's head of distribution Dave Hollis, the weekend was a \"spectacular result\" for the film, which cost a reported $250 million to produce.\n\nPlaying on 4,276 screens, the audiences for \"Ultron's\" debut were 59 percent male and 41 percent under the age of 25.\n\n\"We're in rare air here,\" said Hollis. \"Having the second biggest opening weekend in the history of the movie business is always going to be something you walk away overwhelmingly happy with. The momentum of the brand for Marvel at this point is really something to take a step back and admire.\"\n\nMarvel and Disney now boast the top three opening weekends of all time with \"Avengers\" and its sequel taking the top two slots and \"Iron Man 3\" in third place.\n\nHollis said this is \"confirmation\" that these films are \"bringing a completely different kind of filmmaking to cinema. They're creating events and characters and building worlds in a way that is drawing the attention of huge crowds.\"\n\nRentrak's Senior Media Analyst Paul Dergarabedian agreed that the failure to top the first film is \"in no way\" a disappointment.\n\n\"You have to put this into perspective. Considering the level of competition this weekend in the sporting world, it shows that movie going holds its own against all other options,\" he said.\n\nAlso, while the first film's $207.4 million haul might just seem like a new benchmark to hit, Dergarabedian was quick to point out that opening above $200 million was \"literally like breaking the box office sound barrier.\"\n\nInstead of a new industry standard, a $200 million opening might continue to be an industry rarity.\n\n\"Ultron's\" future success is not in doubt either.\n\n\"These other options were single events. 'Avengers' has a very long playing time. This is a journey to $1 billion and beyond,\" he said.\n\nWith $168 million in international sales this weekend, \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\" has grossed $627 million globally in just 12 days. The film has yet to open in China and Japan.\n\nThe rest of the top five was populated with holdovers, \"The Age of Adaline,\" ''Furious 7,\" ''Paul Blart: Mall Cop,\" and the animated \"Home.\"\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Rentrak. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included.

And it sounds like his review was one of the nicer ones.\n\nWe didn't go. (We haven't yet figured out why those two are mad at each other, actually.) But we did spend too much time this weekend wrestling with a question that started in the newsroom when we heard about Covert's review: Worst sports movie of all-time?\n\nWe asked readers on social media and threw the question at sports and movie nerds in the newsroom. The responses:\n\n\"Caddyshack II\", \"Ladybugs\", \"Ed\" (a.k.a. \"The one with Joey from friends and the chimp, and baseball\") -- voters wanted one of those three to win. A baseball-playing monkey and Matt LeBlanc? No one in here saw that -- thankfully, we were all busy in 1996 and didn't step in this beartrap -- but that seems tough to top.\n\nRobby Benson in One on One. (We'll spare you the poster)\n\nWe had to look up \"One on One\", staring the one and only Robby Benson, and the poster included this line: \"There comes a time when love stops being a ball and starts being a woman.\" Do you feel stupider now that you've read that?\n\nAll \"Rocky\" (even \"Rocky V\") submissions were deleted. Actually, we printed them out just so we could crumple up the paper and throw them away.\n\nAt one point we started remembering that Brian Bosworth and Howie Long were in movies once, but we were too scared to Google any of that and deemed it out of scope.\n\nBefore we go \"Batman v Superman\" and get too long and too boring (and too violent?), we'll finish on a positive note: we only received one nomination for a movie made in the past decade. This, from a Twitter response: \"Gotta be 'Draft Day' in a landslide right? A repulsive movie on pretty much every level.\"\n\n(Poor, Kevin Costner. He aces \"Bull Durham,\" \"Tin Cup\" and \"Field of Dreams\" but lands on this list with \"Draft Day.\")\n\nSo that means we are getting better at making sports movies, right? It would seem so. Maybe we should leave the superheroes in the toy box and starting making more sports movies. Somebody must know how to make \"Moss v Garnett.\"\n\nWe've missed some, we're sure of it. Please tell us about the classics we have (purposefully?) forgotten in the comments below.","8":"'Brother Did It'? Michael Sanchez Blames AMI for 'Scapegoating' Him in Bezos Affair Case Earlier, the American Media Inc. (AMI) insisted that they had received information about Jeff Bezos' extramarital affair from Michael Sanchez, the brother of the Amazon CEO's new girlfriend, who was reportedly paid $200,000 for confidential texts and other information on the tryst.\n\nOn 27 March, the brother of Jeff Bezos' new girlfriend, Michael Sanchez, filed a lawsuit against American Media Inc (AMI) on defamation charges amid the case surrounding Bezos' extramarital affair disclosed by the AMI's National Enquirer earlier in 2019.\n\nAMI insisted that the source of scoop about Amazon CEO's affair is Sanchez. Sanchez accused the company of trying to make him a \"scapegoat\", claiming that he only provided AMI with private texts but did not provide the photographs that were obtained by AMI.\n\n\"The untold story - if you will - has not been told as to how we uncovered the story. I'm saving it for my tombstone\", said Dylan Howard, Chief Content Officer at American Media, according to the lawsuit.\n\nSanchez claimed in his lawsuit that the explicit materials on the affair \"had been illegally obtained using high-tech spyware that secretly hacked into the billionaire's iPhone and extracted his most private and confidential information\".\n\nSanchez confessed that he provided some information on the affair as a means to \"minimize the fallout for his sister by making a deal to cooperate strategically\" with AMI in return for \"control over the narrative\".\n\nBezos insisted that AMI blackmailed him with photos that were never disclosed to the public. The Amazon CEO's claim of being blackmailed remains under FBI investigation. Last year, his top security consultant, Gavin De Becker, said that he did not believe Sanchez had played the key role in the National Enquirer scoop.\n\n\"Reality is complicated, and can't always be boiled down to a simple narrative like \"the brother did it,\" even when that brother is a person who certainly supplied some information to a supermarket tabloid\", De Becker wrote in an article in Daily Beast.\n\nBezos' extramarital affair with Lauren Sanchez resulted in his divorce from his wife, MacKenzie Bezos.\n\nIn January,The Guardian reported that Bezos' telephone was hacked after he received a WhatsApp message from the personal account of Saudi Arabia crown prince Mohammad Bin Salman, which Saudi Arabia has denied.","9":"'Cards Against Humanity' And Other Companies Are Releasing Print-At-Home Games Like many industries around the world, board game companies in particular are reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic. While that may sound counter-intuitive given all the extra time people are spending at home, the issues many companies have stem from the supply chain interruptions that have come as the virus shuts down industries across the globe.\n\nKotaku's Luke Plunkett had a particularly thorough explanation of the issues on Sunday, but the fact that many paper and plastic components of games come from China has severely limited the ability of some games to be released at all, and others are running low on copies as people look for distractions while they practice good social distancing and stay home. Online streaming games, like Jackbox and or Roll20-aided RPG campaigns have excelled in these moments, but traditional tabletop games have also tried their best to help people stay busy while they stay home.\n\nLast week, Cards Against Humanity announced it was releasing a free-to-print \"Family Edition\" of the popular fill-in-the-blank card game known for its questionable humor.\n\nThe original CAH started as a print-at-home game well before its ubiquitous cards were available at big box stores, so this is a throwback of sorts. But the \"Family Edition\" is a printable beta that the company promises it's safe for children and adults and has been thoroughly play-tested with kids in mind.\n\nWe've been working on it for over a year in consultation with child development experts and psychologists. Our plan was to surprise everyone with this in the fall, but we know a lot of families need something to do right now.\n\nSo today we're posting a public beta of Cards Against Humanity: Family Edition for free, so you can print it at home and play it right now with your bored family. We'll figure out how to make money on it later.\n\nOther companies have also moved to release print-at-home versions of their games in an effort to keep gamers interested and trying new things. Asmodee, which makes games like Ticket To Ride, Settlers of Catan and Splendor, announced Monday that it would release six print-and-play versions of its games online as well.\n\nDixit in particular is a great play-at-home storytelling game for all ages, and the other Asmodee titles are a good mix of family and more advanced board games if you need something to keep kids occupied as well. It's a great idea, and one that can keep interest in an entertainment industry that's likely to experience some difficult periods as the effects of COVID-19 continue to impact industries around the world.","10":"'Finding Dory' blows animation record out of the water LOS ANGELES -- The forgetful blue fish of \"Finding Dory\" is box office gold.\n\nThe Pixar sequel far surpassed its already ocean-sized expectations to take in $136.2 million in North American theaters, making it the highest-grossing animated debut of all time, not adjusting for inflation, according to comScore estimates Sunday.\n\nThe 2007 film \"Shrek the Third\" was the previous record-holder, with a $121.6 million debut.\n\n\"Finding Dory,\" which comes 13 years after \"Finding Nemo,\" is also the second-largest June opening of all time, with \"Jurassic World\" at No. 1. The well-reviewed film features the voices of Ellen DeGeneres and Albert Brooks.\n\nGoing into the weekend, analysts expected \"Finding Dory\" to draw big, $100 million-plus numbers, but never this big.\n\n\"The thought was: 'Could this be the movie to eclipse \"Toy Story 3's\" opening?' not, 'Could it become the biggest animated opening of all time?'\" said Paul Dergarabedian, comScore's senior media analyst. \"That's the power of the Pixar brand.\"\n\nUntil now, \"Toy Story 3\" was Pixar's biggest opening ever, with $110.3 million.\n\nDisney Executive Vice President of Distribution Dave Hollis was particularly heartened that the film did such robust late-night business on Friday and Saturday.\n\n\"That's really a testament to this being a picture for everyone -- not just for families,\" Hollis said.\n\n\"Finding Dory\" has the animated seas to itself until \"The Secret Life of Pets\" opens July 8.\n\nThe Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson buddy comedy \"Central Intelligence\" also had a relatively muscular weekend, with a better-than-expected $34.5 million, putting it in second place.\n\n\"It's a real home run,\" said Jeff Goldstein, Warner Bros.' executive vice president of domestic distribution. \"These two comedians are just stars. They connect with their audience and each other in such a strong way. You just laugh when you watch them.\"\n\n\"Central Intelligence\" cost a reported $50 million to make and scored especially well with younger audiences, who the studio hopes will propel word-of-mouth business in weeks to come. The next major comedy releases don't come until mid-July, with \"Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates\" and \"Ghostbusters.\"\n\nIn third place, the James Wan horror pic \"The Conjuring 2\" fell 62 percent in its second weekend in theaters, earning $15.6 million and bringing its domestic total to $71.7 million.\n\nRounding out the top five were \"Now You See Me 2,\" with $9.7 million, and \"Warcraft,\" with $6.5 million.\n\nOverall, the weekend is down nearly 5 percent from last year, when \"Inside Out\" launched with $90.4 million and \"Jurassic World\" earned $106.6 million in its second weekend in theaters.\n\nStill, Dergarabedian says the comparatively big audiences this weekend are good for business in the long run because they'll be exposed to trailers for upcoming summer films. The success of \"Finding Dory\" and \"Central Intelligence\" also comes after a few weekends of underwhelming sequels and all-out flops.\n\n\"A movie like 'Dory' can reinvigorate a marketplace that has been in the doldrums for the last few weeks,\" he said.\n\nEstimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to comScore. Where available, the latest international numbers for Friday through Sunday are also included.

The first of three shows starts on BBC1 on 30 December\n\nThe first time I visited the Great Barrier Reef was in 1957 when I was on my way to New Guinea. In those days, television didn't have a lot of money so, when you got to the other side of the world, you took advantage of it as you never knew when you were going to get back again, and so I took in the Barrier Reef on the way.\n\nIt was right at the beginning of the era of underwater swimming. There had been a Viennese pair, Han and Lotte Hass, who had a show underwater called Diving to Adventure. Those of us who had television sets - our jaws dropped! This wonderful girl in this white costume just knocking sharks on the head with the camera. Amazing!\n\nI'm no sort of underwater swimmer, I didn't know what I was doing! The idea that I was competing with people like the Hasses and Jacques Cousteau, who was amazing to me - I was just dead lucky to be there at the right time. Mike Davis, the director of my present film, Great Barrier Reef, discovered that the BBC had all this stuff I'd made in the archive - I hadn't seen that sun-bronzed boy swimming with extraordinary grace for almost 60 years!\n\nFrom all my travels, the first time I put on scuba gear and dived on the coral reef is the moment I remember most vividly. Suddenly, this amazing world with a thousand things you didn't know existed is revealed right in front of you, all wonderful colours and shapes. Just the very thing of going underwater itself is exciting, as suddenly you are released from the shackles of gravity and you can move anywhere - great shoals of fish, the reef is as rich as it comes, as varied and as beautiful as it gets. On land, the rainforest is comparable - but the difference is you can walk for a day and see absolutely nothing. Where are all these bloody monkeys they are always on about? But on a reef you see everything immediately.\n\nIt's one of the great romances, being able to travel to the bottom of the sea, like in Jules Verne, and I was able to do that this time for the programme when I went down in the Triton submersible. It is fantastic, better than travelling to the moon because you can do it for two hours then come back up again! It is a big plastic bubble with a hole at the top and watertight seal, and you get in it, sit in a chair, put down the lid and off you go. So, unlike swimming, you aren't troubled about breathing or getting hot, you just sit there, thinking this is fabulous. It's just breathtaking, a dream.\n\nIndigenous Australians' memories are so much better than ours. They have a bank of information and literature and history in their minds which is transmitted with extraordinary fidelity from generation to generation. They tell the extraordinary story about how the sea started flooding the land, and every year it advanced and they had to move - they were nomadic anyway but they had to move back and back and back. Recent research showed, to everyone's surprise, that this actually happened at the end of the last ice age, but the people of the area have always known it, which is extremely romantic.\n\nThe area has changed hugely in all sorts of ways since my visit in 1957. Islands that were uninhabited when we sailed past them are now big holiday resorts and scientific stations, and along the coast there are now a lot of human settlements. But the dangers the reef faces are not specifically from that, because it is almost independent of the human population - it is quite possible to sustain the large number of visitors and holiday makers on the reef if they behave in a proper way.\n\nThe reef is only roughly 10,000 years old, so if it was slowly changed, the natural world would change but it wouldn't be catastrophic because it would evolve. But if it changed in 50 years, from an increase of 2C in the sea temperature, which would kill the coral, that would be catastrophic. And we are heading for that - the next decade or two you could see real disaster.\n\nI have been at this a long time, but almost ever year there is a new technological advance. Sometimes it's big, sometimes it's small - maybe a new lens that can suddenly hold in focus something within 6 inches of your eye and also the mountains 20 miles away. There is nowhere you can't film now, in the pitch dark, the bottom of the sea - you couldn't do that 10 years ago, and when you did it would cost you the earth - or it's high speed, or drones. But still the biggest change has been moving to colour television.\n\nI was carried along by the tide of these advances, bobbing about at the front, but I had very little to do with the tide. I didn't innovate the programmes. Unromantically, it is the defence budget that has researched a great number of these things, the fact that you can put little tiny cameras here and there, bug things and film at night, detect a warm face at over 150 yards behind a tree ... thermal cameras like that were developed by the military.\n\nMy four years as controller of BBC2, from 1965, were great.

The report surveyed 323 hospitals between March 23 and March 27 and found widespread shortages of testing supplies and personal protective equipment, long waits for the results of COVID-19 tests and difficulties expanding their capacities to help additional patients.\n\n\"It's just wrong,\" Trump said. \"Did I hear the word 'inspector general?' Really? It's wrong, and they'll talk to you about it. It's wrong.\"\n\nA reporter pressed the question, noting the report came \"from your own government.\"\n\n\"Well, where did he come from, the inspector general? What's his name? Find me his name, let me know. If you find me his name I'd appreciate it. All I can tell you is this: we put up on the board - you're going to ask the admiral,\" Trump said, referring to Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Brett Giroir.\n\n\"But sir, these are hospitals who say that they're waiting a week or longer to get their test results,\" she asked. \"Why is this still taking so long?\"\n\n\"Give me the name of the inspector general,\" Trump said. \"Could politics be entered into that?\"\n\nAfter Trump moved on, other reporters soon returned to the question of the IG report, telling him the name of the inspector general and reiterating that her report was based on a survey of hundreds of US hospitals.\n\n\"It still could be her opinion. When was she appointed?\" Trump asked. \"The point is, we are doing an incredible job on testing, we are doing a better job than anyone in the world right now on testing. There's nobody close ... Let me know when she was appointed, would you?\"\n\nGiroir's answer was more informative, but no less condemnatory of the IG report for that.\n\n\"As the president said, 1.79 million tests have been done, and this does not count the hundreds of thousands of tests that are done within hospitals that are now currently not reporting, so I'm sure we're well over 2 million,\" Giroir told the reporters.\n\n\"That inspector general report was done here, on 23rd and 24th, during our ramp-up period, quite a long time ago. There was clearly, and it's hard to interpret the report, because it mixes up all kinds of things, but clearly there was complaints by some hospitals of a backlog, probably that sent out tests, and that is true: there were several days of backlog at some of the major labs that have been taken care of.\"\n\n\"I don't know the inspector general, I don't know that person, I'll tell you one thing I have a problem with: if there was such a problem that she knew about - her or he knew about - on March 23rd and 24th, why did I find out about the tests from them on the news media at 8 o'clock this morning? If there was a problem, I think you're ethically obliged to tell me where that is so we can interact with it like I do every single day. So, that's a discussion for the future,\" Giroir said.\n\nTrump then asked the reporters: \"How long has that person been in government?\"\n\n\"She did serve in the previous administration,\" responded Jonathan Karl, the chief White House correspondent for ABC News. Trump's reply was furious.\n\n\"Oh, you didn't tell me that! Oh, I see. You didn't tell me that, John ... You mean the Obama administration. Thank you for telling me that. See, there's a typical 'fake news' deal. You're a third-rate reporter, and what you just said is a disgrace, OK? ... Thank you very much, John, thank you very much.

None were under any illusions about how difficult this challenge would be. \"The term continues to be used in many different ways,\" one participant observed, noting its association with issues as disparate as McCarthyism in the United States and Maoism in China. In the end, they failed to settle on a single definition, concluding that \"there can, at present, be no doubt about the importance of populism. But no one is clear what it is.\"\n\nThat was in 1967. More than half a century later, populism is still being used in many different ways: to describe the election of Donald Trump in the U.S., to explain Brexit in Britain, and to contextualize the disruptions taking place in national politics across the globe. The sheer scale of the phenomenon is evident in just how much everyone seems to be talking about it. Words like populist and nationalist, once confined to academic circles, have become fixtures in the lexicon. Countless books and articles have been written on the subject. The pope has weighed in on the matter as well, declaring populism an \"evil\" that \"ends badly.\"\n\nBut even as definitions of populism have developed, many people are still none the wiser about what the term means. It has taken on a versatile quality -- one that can be applied to politicians as varied as the Netherlands' Geert Wilders on the far right and France's Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon on the far left. For some, populism is part and parcel of the far right and nationalism -- issues that, though not completely divorced from contemporary populist rhetoric, do little to help explain it. For others, populism has simply been reduced to a political shorthand to describe that which we do not like.\n\nThe more populism gets invoked in these ways, though, the more muddled its definition becomes. And the more muddled it becomes, the less useful it ultimately is. After all, what's the point of invoking populism without a concerted effort to apply it consistently? Lacking a clear attempt to better define such terms, we risk stripping them of their meaning entirely. Indeed, the campaign to do away with the word populist has already begun.\n\nIt's easy to understand how populism has become such a dirty word in modern politics. The term dates back to the late 19th century and the arrival of the populist People's Party in the United States. American farmers had grown frustrated with their lack of prosperity in the economic boom of the Gilded Age -- an exclusion they attributed to government corruption and the outsize influence of Big Business. In the People's Party (or the Populist Party, as it was widely known) they found an outlet for those frustrations. The party, which positioned itself as an alternative to the Republicans and the Democrats, campaigned on a series of what were at the time radical policies, including increased economic regulation, nationalized railroads, and directly elected senators. Like many modern populists, the party also showed antipathy toward immigrants, blaming their presence on \"the manufacturers\" and their desire for \"cheap labor.\" In the end, what doomed the Populists wasn't their failure to breach the two-party system (they gained control of state legislatures and governorships across the country), but the co-opting of their policies by the Democrats. Within a decade of its formation, the Populist Party effectively disappeared.\n\nThe term populist didn't disappear, of course. In the intervening years, it began to appear in regions as widespread as Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Africa. Still, the debate over what constituted populism was largely limited to academic settings, culminating in the first-ever conference on populism, at the LSE in 1967. It was perhaps for this reason that many argued in favor of a broad definition. \"It has to be loosely organized and without a strict ideology,\" one academic argued. \"It is perfectly legitimate to define populism in the widest, most latitudinarian fashion,\" added another.\n\nSubsequent definitions have been formed since -- many as broad as the academics at the LSE advised -- but populism did not enter mainstream parlance for decades, largely until the twin shocks of the Brexit referendum and the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The term has become almost exclusively associated with upsets to the global political system ever since. The rise of the far right in Germany? Populism. Narendra Modi's nationalist project in India? Populism. The surge of anti-establishment parties in Brazil, Italy, and the Philippines? Definitely populism.\n\nRead: The paradox of Trump's populism\n\nMany of these cases do fall under the populist umbrella -- one which, according to the author and academic Cas Mudde's widely referenced definition, is predicated on the notion that society is divided into two competing groups: the \"pure people\" versus the \"corrupt elite.\" Catherine Fieschi, the author of Populocracy: The Tyranny of Authenticity and the Rise of Populism, put forward her own list of characteristics to identify populist leaders -- namely, those who not only claim to represent the will of the morally superior \"ordinary people,\" but also position themselves as uniquely capable of doing so. As a result, Fieschi argues, populists reduce their political opponents, whom they often accuse of being a part of the elite, to enemy status.\n\nBenjamin Moffitt, a senior lecturer at Australian Catholic University and the author of Populism, describes the phenomenon not as a fixed ideology, like socialism or liberalism, but as a political style. \"That is, something that is done by politicians and political actors,\" Moffitt told me. Populism isn't so much a belief system as \"a way of speaking, acting, and presenting oneself.\"\n\nThough the versatility of populism's definition makes it applicable to parties and leaders across the political spectrum, this hasn't prevented many from viewing it as an inherently far-right phenomenon that can be applied only to parties and leaders who fit the typical anti-immigrant, nativist mold. Part of this has to do with the fact that some of the most electorally successful, high-profile examples of populism have been from the far right: Marine Le Pen in France (who advanced to the runoff of the country's 2017 presidential election), Alternative for Germany (the country's largest opposition party), Viktor Orb\u00e1n's ruling Fidesz in Hungary (where the prime minister has cracked down on academic and press freedom). Relatively few populist parties on the left -- Podemos in Spain and Syriza in Greece stand out -- can claim the same kind of momentum or media attention.\n\nThis perception can also be attributed to the way those on the right have chosen to talk about populism. Steve Bannon, the former Trump strategist who is attempting to create a global movement of nationalist parties (to little effect), opted to embrace the populist label when describing Trump's political movement, which he likened to the populism of a Trump predecessor, Andrew Jackson. Alexander Gauland, the honorary chairman of Alternative for Germany, declared that his party was a \"populist movement and proud of it.\" Even Giuseppe Conte, the Italian prime minister who briefly led a coalition government alongside the far-right League until last year, said that \"if populism is the attitude of listening to people's needs, then we lay a claim to it.\" By embracing the label, Moffitt said, what once was regarded as toxic became a tool \"for signalling a lack of complicity with 'the elite' and the sense of being in touch with 'the people.'\"\n\nThose on the political right weren't the only ones to repurpose populism. The more that figures like Bannon and Gauland have embraced the populist label, the more inclined self-described antipopulists have been to reject it. Mainstream figureheads such as the U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, former Italian Premier Matteo Renzi, and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair have all voiced their concerns about the implications of right-wing populism and its threat to liberal democracy. In doing so, they help propel the notion that populism should be understood not only as a right-wing phenomenon, but as akin to a political pejorative.\n\nRead: Italy's answer to populism\n\nThis view has led to a number of other misconceptions: One is that any politician who invokes the will of \"the people\" must necessarily be a populist. If that were the case, every politician could be labeled a populist, because \"everybody talks about people in a democracy,\" Daphne Halikiopoulou, an associate comparative-politics professor at the University of Reading, told me. Another misconception is that populism and xenophobic nationalism, or nativism, are inherently linked. In reality, neither ideology is reliant on the other to exist. \"Both prioritize a particular 'in' group over an 'out' group,\" Halikiopoulou said, but populists tend to prioritize \"ordinary people,\" whereas nativists prioritize those of a certain ethnic background.\n\nA final misconception is that the populist label is appropriate for any politician who deviates from the mainstream -- an idea that has been recently applied to noteworthy figures on the left, such as the outgoing British Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and the U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. Though both men exhibit some populist tendencies -- both, for example, criticize those they consider to be part of the economic elite -- they fall short of being traditional populists, at least under Fieschi's definition. For one, neither claims to represent an exclusive and homogenous \"people,\" but rather the interests of citizens as a whole. And neither has vilified his opponents as inherently illegitimate.\n\nThe way populism is often applied suggests that its use is more for effect rather than explanation. Much in the same way that socialist has been bandied around to discredit politicians like Sanders in the U.S. (where the term conjures negative images of the Soviet Union and Chavismo in Venezuela), populist has its own negative baggage. As a result, neither of these terms ends up communicating an understood idea. Instead, they simply obscure.\n\nWe will likely never have a foolproof definition of populism -- it's difficult enough to clearly define a political philosophy, let alone a political style.\n\nStill, this doesn't preclude us from applying it more responsibly. Part of this requires more clearly defining our terms. As someone who frequently writes about populism and nationalism, I've had my own fair share of feedback about use of these terms. In my reporting of the recent Irish election, for example, I referred to Sinn F\u00e9in, a left-wing party that advocates for the unification of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, as a \"nationalist party,\" much in the same way one might use the term to describe the Scottish Nationalist Party or the Catalan independence movement. Still, some readers presumed that by calling Sinn F\u00e9in \"nationalist,\" I was likening them to other far-right, nativist elements in Europe -- a comparison that is wholly unrepresentative of the party.\n\nRead: The new populist playbook\n\nBut it also means not overusing these terms to the point of confusion. \"For example, are you speaking about Trump denigrating Mexicans? Well, that's racism,\" Moffitt said. \"Don't call that 'populist rhetoric' and soften the blow. It just muddies the waters.\"\n\nWorse yet, it risks making the term entirely meaningless.\n\n\"If everyone is a populist in one way or another, then nobody is not a populist,\" Halikiopoulou said. \"It explains absolutely everything, and therefore it explains nothing.\"\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

For immigration authorities, a \"sham marriage\" or a \"marriage of convenience\" is one that's contracted with the purpose of enabling the migrant spouse to obtain a visa or a residence permit.\n\nThe officer seemed to accept that Helen and her partner were in a relationship and planned to get married. But he was still doubting the motives of her Nigerian partner. \"Do you see that?\" he asked Helen, pointing with his finger to a building opposite the embassy. \"Yes, I do,\" she replied.\n\nWell, a Nigerian man is capable of selling you this building today and tomorrow you realise that the building has never actually existed.\n\nA few weeks later, Helen and her partner received the news that their visa request had been rejected. The reason given was there were doubts about whether the marriage motives of the Nigerian man were \"genuine\".\n\nThis story was recounted to me by Helen while I was conducting research into the issue of the role marriages play in gaining entry to European countries. Over the past decades most have started investigating marriages involving foreign spouses. Restrictions and controls to marriage migration, which may result in keeping the spouses apart, are often justified as necessary measures to protect women from bad marriages. The reasons given is that they are \"sham\", \"forced\" or \"arranged\".\n\nSuch claims provide legitimacy to European countries to intervene in the intimate lives of couples. Immigration authorities deter all but \"love-based\" marriages. In this context, love becomes a tool for migration control and for protecting the position of married women (as seen by these authorities).\n\nThe differentiation between \"sham\" and \"genuine\" marriage is based on the assumption that motives of love and interest are separate from each other. In a recent article I argue that this dichotomy is simplistic and misleading. I question the idea that love is by default good for women, especially when love is understood as unrelated to interest.\n\nThe article is based on ethnographic fieldwork I did over the course of a year in the Netherlands, Greece and Ghana on the marriages of West African migrants with European women. The fieldwork included interviews with couples, lawyers and immigration officers.\n\nSham versus genuine\n\nI challenge a fundamental assumption in the debate on \"sham\" versus \"genuine\", which is that love and interest are mutually exclusive. Evidence suggests they are not.\n\nAs my research shows, marriages between African and European nationals are motivated both by interest (papers, money) and feelings (love, care, sexual enjoyment). The entanglement of romantic feelings with material gains does not make these marriages different from the ones of non-migrant couples. On the contrary, I argue that they are very similar.\n\nThink, for example, of couples who formalised their relationship for reasons such as tax purposes, inheritance and social security. Feminist and kinship scholars have also pointed out that marriage always involves exchanges of various resources and services between spouses - sometimes explicitly, sometimes not. These include care, financial security, love, sex and domestic work.\n\nAn additional factor is that norms of love differ for men and women. The expectation to demonstrate love for family through self-sacrifice is more common for women than for men.\n\nThe paradox\n\nImmigration policies are designed on the assumption that love cannot co-exist with exchange. European countries justify deciding against cross-broder marriages on the grounds that they are using the ideal of love to protect women. But here lies the paradox: this ideal may deprive women of their bargaining power in marriage and their quest for recognition in a relationship.\n\nFor this reason, the dichotomies of love and interest and of \"sham\" versus \"genuine\" marriage are not only inaccurate and misleading. They are also potentially disempowering, especially for female spouses.","18":"'Shark Tank' gets a slice of Minnesota pizza-making company Two Woodbury brothers got what they were fishing for on \"Shark Tank.\" In last Friday's edition, Andy and Eric Bert impressed judge Kevin O'Leary enough to get him to invest in Bertello, their outdoor pizza-making oven company.\n\nThey didn't land the big fish without a struggle.

Being stuck in one's house for an indeterminate amount of time works wonders for your backlog, which is why I found myself picking up .hack\/\/Infection for the first time. While the game is definitely showing its age, as far as its visuals and play go since PS2 games and HDTVs don't mix well, the game still does a sharp job of capturing the feel of MMOs through navigating its complex world, finding online friends, and carrying a useless party to a dungeon's conclusion.\n\n.hack\/\/Infection's story follows Kite, a player character being guided through an MMO called The World. Kite was just supposed to be running some dungeons with his high-level pal, Orca, but Orca gets attacked and beaten by a monster that's showing signs of a strange corruption\/virus. This defeat is followed by a full server crash, which gives Kite's real-world player time to find out that Orca's player, Yasuhiko, has fallen into a coma. ...As have a handful of other people who were also playing the game. Now, it's up to Kite to play through The World to find out how an MMO is putting its players into a catatonic state.\n\nIt's a bold narrative move, one its developers could possibly written through story moments within the game itself, but the folks at CyberConnect2 instead put in a lot of work to make this feel like you're the player of the MMO. To do this, the team placed the game within a mock PC interface, complete with email, message boards, and a launcher for the game itself, all of which connect the player with the game's protagonist by making them take on that role through their in-game actions.\n\nBeing able to log out of the very game you're playing to head to a fake desktop is a nice touch and creates a separation between the game and reality that was far from common in games at the time. Most titles aim to drag you into their world and forget reality for a time, but .hack\/\/Infection wants you to be very aware of the outside world. This breaking of immersion within the realm of The World actually increases the player's sense of connection within the game itself, putting you in the shoes of a player trying to solve a mystery on their computer through playing an MMO.\n\nIt's the chat boards and emails that remind me of old days spent playing MMOs or just the earlier days of the internet and video games. If you got stuck, you would have to log onto message boards or contact friends to figure out how they accomplished a task or found a secret item. You had to send your question out into the internet and then wait for an answer in the days before videos and walkthroughs seemed to spring up overnight and even before launch.\n\nWhile this might connect it better to MMOs from years ago, it is still a clever recreation of the connection and companionship that fuel a solid MMO experience. Shared thoughts and discoveries help open up an MMO to all of its players, and that pool of knowledge that comes from the other players - in .hack\/\/Infection's case, the invented message boards and emails - mimic that connection with other players in a clever way. It makes things feel more real to discover hidden realms and glitches within the game through this message-style sharing than in just butting heads with the game itself.\n\nAlso, I had to comb message boards for answers on certain things about the game that would direct me to in-game message boards. Which I thought was kind of neat in a surreal kind of way.\n\nGot stuck while playing .hack\/\/Infection? Log off and check your email. Look into the message boards to see if anyone has suggested a new realm or event. It's a neat touch that, while contained within the game itself, sets up this interesting disconnect that somehow makes it feel more true to an MMO experience, and still reminds me of many of the times I've gotten stuck in FFXIV these days. Still got to check out boards and videos for advice on how to run bosses or figure out where I should be going when I'm scrambling to find the last Moogle.\n\n.hack\/\/Infection isn't only clever with its systems outside The World, but also those within it. Combat is live as you auto attack whichever target you're aiming at, and you're free to use special attacks that add onto this basic onslaught (although cooldowns aren't a big issue here). Other than digging through some clunky menus to get to your abilities, it doesn't feel too different from MMO combat now.\n\nThat's not where it really feels like an MMO, though. It's more in the connection the game creates with the other players you can bring with you. Kite will meet a variety of people throughout the game, all of whom can join your party when you head out into a dangerous zone. If they show up, that is. The game features a possibility that the NPC players won't be online when you're heading out into combat. Like your real raid buddies, sometimes they're just not available to play with and you have to work with who's around.\n\nDon't rely on them a whole lot, either. While a full party is helpful, these lunkheads can be largely useless, forcing you to carry them through the dungeon as they serve as distractions. They'll take down foes and do things, don't get me wrong, but they can make some idiotic moves often, requiring frequent healing and revives (even when one of THEM is supposed to be a healer). It's an experience that was annoying, but reminded me of many bad parties I've been a part of in a way that brought back some funny memories. It's strange to find bad NPCs being a positive thing, but it works to make .hack\/\/Infection feel that much closer to a real MMO.\n\nThe NPCs even straight up ignore the better armor and tools you give them sometimes, just like real people! So realistic (infuriating)!\n\nThese varied elements all mix to make .hack\/\/Infection feel like an MMO in ways that feel both nostalgic and all-too-familiar for modern MMO players. Useless party members, outside systems, and a realistic connection to other players (even if they're fictional) give this game a memorable personality that help it stand out from many RPGs with its sheer ambition to capture the experience of MMOs within a single-player game. Even today, it's an impressive feat that I'm excited to keep digging into.\n\nUnless my party of morons gets me killed in a long dungeon again.","28":"10 Perfect Films to Watch While Stuck at Home Are you longing for human connection? Or looking to laugh for two hours? Here are the best movies for every social-distancing mood.\n\nAs the days spent in social isolation drag on, the utility of all the subscription-based streaming services available online and through your TV only grows -- and so does the difficulty of deciding how to use them. If you, like me, are having trouble figuring out what to watch during these overwhelming times, I'm here to help. There are troves of great films available on every app, even if some of them are buried by algorithms that hide them from the front page. Here are some choice options to match a variety of sheltering-in-place moods, available on Netflix, Hulu, HBO Now, or the Criterion Channel.\n\nIf you're feeling trapped at home: A Ghost Story\n\nThe protagonist of David Lowery's meditative tale of love and loss is an unnamed man (played by Casey Affleck) who is killed in a car accident and begins to haunt his own house, wearing a white sheet and solemnly watching his wife (Rooney Mara) until she moves out. Since he's tied to the building, the movie becomes a strange fairy tale about watching as things change, powerless to stop them. That may sound harrowing, but the film revels in the beauty of the passage of time as well as the tragedy, and has a great (if inadvertent) depiction of social distancing. (Netflix)\n\nIf you're feeling nostalgic for human connection in the city: Frances Ha\n\nNoah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig's effervescent collaboration (he directed; she stars; they wrote together) might be the best movie in both of their storied careers. Following a 27-year-old dancer (Gerwig) trying to scrape out a life in New York, it perfectly captures the intense need for close friendship that people have in their post-college lives, and the pain and joy that comes with that. It's also a terrific snapshot of New York in the early 2010s that will provide a bit of comfort for anyone missing the city's busy streets. (Criterion Channel, Netflix)\n\nIf you feel like you're living the same day over and over: Groundhog Day\n\nAn obvious choice, perhaps, but no wonder -- Harold Ramis's film is one of the most reliable and delightful pieces of entertainment in Hollywood history. The plot's template has been much-copied over the years: Bill Murray's misanthropic newsman travels to a quaint town and gets stuck endlessly reliving the second of February, unable to break out of the loop. It's not only a wonderful romantic comedy, but also a slyly spiritual tale, a parable of self-improvement that never feels preachy and that reveals more depth on every viewing. (Netflix)\n\nIf you're fantasizing about going on the road: Lost in America\n\nAlbert Brooks's 1985 satire of an upper-middle-class couple buying an RV and trying to shed their bourgeois trappings is just as biting as it was upon release. Most of all, it's an object lesson in looking before you leap -- sure, the open highways and the great unknown might seem tempting, but even with a fully loaded Winnebago, problems will spring up sooner than you think. (HBO Now, Hulu)\n\nIf you want to luxuriate in movie-star charm: Out of Sight\n\nSteven Soderbergh's sizzling neo-noir has long been one of my go-to films for summoning a good mood. Though it's an expertly made work with a sharply funny screenplay, its real magic comes from its fantastic central couple, played by George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez. Both are early in their careers, but they already sparkle with superstar appeal, particularly in what might be the best love scene ever filmed. (HBO Now, Hulu)\n\nIf you're looking to indulge your paranoia: Pi\n\nDarren Aronofsky's debut thriller was made in 1998 for $60,000, featured a cast of total unknowns, and focused on mental illness, mysticism, and math. Even so, it became a cult hit because of Aronofsky's deft but surreal storytelling. It's a great portrayal of cabin fever, starring Sean Gullette as a shut-in who is either going slowly insane or has found a mathematical way to predict the future and communicate with God. Or both. (Hulu)\n\nIf you're looking for something meditative and satisfying: Jiro Dreams of Sushi\n\nDavid Gelb's 2011 documentary about the Japanese master chef Jiro Ono perfects many of the visual tropes that cooking documentaries rely on -- montages of food being delicately assembled to orchestral music, and lush close-ups of individual meals. That this imagery is now ubiquitous doesn't make it any less watchable, and the serenity of Jiro's approach to sushi versus the bluntness of his relationship with his children remains totally transfixing to watch. As a bonus, Netflix is also currently streaming Documentary Now!'s perfect send-up of Jiro, an episode titled \"Juan Likes Rice and Chicken.\" (Hulu, Netflix)\n\nIf you're looking to broaden your horizons: Martin Scorsese's World Cinema Project\n\nThough Scorsese is a master of cinema in his own right, one of his most significant contributions to the medium is his film foundation, which restores and preserves some of the world's best movies in order to bring them to a wider audience. Criterion currently has 17 of these from countries such as Senegal, Thailand, Turkey, Brazil, and Cuba, all gathered in one neat package. The service also has many other collections worth browsing, including retrospectives of the acting careers of such legends as Burt Lancaster, Wendy Hiller, and Max von Sydow, with more cycling in all the time. (Criterion Channel)\n\nIf you want to settle in for a long watch of one of the best movies of the century: Zodiac\n\nDavid Fincher's greatest film is two hours and 37 minutes long and better than any true-crime documentary. Its narrative of the Zodiac Killer's crimes becomes a reckoning with America's never-ending obsession with murder, and with the even more intoxicating fallacy that every problem -- no matter how frightening or obscure -- can be solved. Zodiac is always worth watching, but right now, it offers a cautionary tale of a government and its private citizens haphazardly coming together in a time of crisis. (Netflix)\n\nIf you just want to laugh: Midnight Run\n\nMartin Brest's 1988 buddy comedy, starring Robert De Niro as an irascible bounty hunter and Charles Grodin as his curmudgeonly quarry, is, in my opinion, the most watchable film ever made. I defy you to turn on Midnight Run for even 30 seconds without getting instantly sucked in. Every scene is funny, the humor is never overplayed, and the lead actors unlock performances from one another that you might have thought impossible. If self-quarantining is getting you down, I recommend 126 minutes of Midnight Run, stat. (Hulu)\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

Connect Twitter","29":"10 of the best ways to travel by Dervla Murphy In this age of mobile phones, cybercafes and satellite links, it's harder than ever to truly escape ... but not impossible. Dervla Murphy, who has ventured to the ends of the earth with only the most basic provisions, explains how\n\nThe individual traveller's \"age of adventure\" has long since been ended by \"S&T\" (science and technology: an abbreviation that dates me). Now our planet's few remaining undeveloped expanses are accessible only to well-funded expeditions protected by mobile phones and helicopters - enterprises unattractive to the temperamental descendents of Mungo Park, Mary Kingsley et al. Happily, it's still possible for such individuals to embark on solo journeys through little-known regions where they can imagine how real explorers used to feel.\n\nReviewers tend to describe my most exhilarating journeys as \"adventures\", though to me they are a form of escapism - a concept unfairly tainted with negative connotations. If journeys are designed as alternatives to one's everyday routine, why shouldn't they be escapist? Why not move in time as well as space, and live for a few weeks or months at the slow pace enjoyed by our ancestors? In recent decades everything has become quicker and easier: transport, communications, heating, cooking, cleaning, dressing, shopping, entertaining. \"S&T\" have reduced physical effort to the minimum - but are we genetically equipped to cope with our effortless new world? The stats show increasing numbers of us developing ulcers, having nervous breakdowns, eating too much or too little, taking to drink and\/or drugs, retreating from our own reality in plastic surgery clinics. It's surely time to promote the therapeutic value of slow travel.\n\nThere is, of course, a certain irony here: technology has rendered the traditional simple journey somewhat artificial. Previously, those who roamed far and wide had to be isolated for long periods; now isolation is a deliberately chosen luxury. Had I died of a burst appendix in the Hindu Kush or the Simiens or the Andes, it would have been my own fault (no two-way radio) rather than a sad misfortune. Therefore, in one sense, escapist travelling has become a game - but only in one sense. The actual journey is for real: whatever happens, you can't chicken out. You're alone where you've chosen to be, and must take the consequences. (I prefer to forget that nowadays one is never quite alone. With all those satellites, the solitary traveller may be observed picking her nose in the middle of the Great Karoo.)\n\nTo facilitate escapism, I offer the following tips ...\n\n1. Choose your country, use guidebooks to identify the areas most frequented by foreigners - and then go in the opposite direction.\n\nThis advice reeks of political incorrectness; it's \"snobbish\" to draw a clear distinction between travellers and tourists. Yet it's also realistic. The escapist traveller needs space, solitude, silence. Tragically, during my lifetime, roads have drastically depleted that natural habitat. Adverts for phoney \"adventure tours\" make me grind my few remaining teeth. For example, \"England to Kenya by truck! Overland adventure! See five countries in six weeks!\" Who in their right mind wants to see five countries in six weeks? How not to escape . . . I always try to get off the beaten track. One favourite place where I did so was a trek from Asmara to Addis Ababa. Things are different now, but most people I encountered then had never seen a white person before. Even on more recent trips in Russia and Romania - where I took fairly obvious routes that certainly weren't unchartered land - I always stayed away from the tourist trails.\n\n2. Mug up on history.\n\nTo travel in ignorance of a region's history leaves you unable to understand the \"why\" of anything or anyone. For instance, Castro's Cuba (the subject of my latest book) must baffle visitors uninformed about the 500-year lead-up to Fidel's revolution. But heavy sociological or political research is unnecessary - although if you happen to fancy that sort of thing it will add an extra dimension to your journey. Otherwise, enough of current politics will be revealed as you go along, and in those happy lands where domestic politics don't matter to the locals you can forget about them.\n\nLearn as much as possible about religious and social taboos, and then scrupulously respect them. Where gifts of money are inappropriate, find out what substitutes to carry. In Muslim countries, such as Afghanistan, a code of conduct towards travellers prevents acceptance of money from guests, so I often buy gifts for the children from the local bazaars.\n\n3. Travel alone, or with just one prepubescent child.\n\nIn some countries even two adults may be perceived as providing mutual support, making acceptability by the locals less spontaneous and complete. Au contraire, a child's presence emphasises your trust in the community's goodwill. And because children pay little attention to racial or cultural differences, junior companions rapidly demolish barriers of shyness or apprehension often raised when foreigners unexpectedly approach a remote village. I found this to be the case in all my travels with my young daughter, especially when we travelled through Kodagu in southern India.\n\n4. Don't overplan.\n\nAt sunrise it's not necessary - nor even desirable - to know where you are going to be at sunset. In sparsely inhabited areas carry a lightweight tent and sleeping bag. Elsewhere, rely on fate to provide shelter: dependence on those met en route greatly enhances escapism, and villagers are unfailingly hospitable to those who trust them. I have been welcomed into villagers' homes everywhere I've cycled or walked, and was always grateful for what was typically a space on the floor. \"Trust\" is a key word for relaxed travelling among people whose different way of life may demand adaptability but should prompt no unease or suspicion.\n\n5. Be self-propelling: walk or cycle.\n\nFor long treks, far from roads and towns, buy a pack animal to carry food, camping gear, kerosene for your stove if firewood is scarce - and of course your child, should he or she be too small to walk all day.\n\nWhen organising such a trek, allow for spending a week or 10 days at your starting point, enquiring about the best source of pack animals. Take care to find a reliable advisor as well as a horse trader - preferably someone unconnected to the trader. In Ethiopia, in 1966, I was lucky enough to be advised by Princess Aida, granddaughter of the then-emperor, Haile Selassie, and half a dozen mules were paraded around the courtyard of a royal palace for my inspection. A decade or so later, in Baltistan, I bought a retired polo pony to carry Rachel, my six-year-old daughter, and our camping gear and supplies, including two sacks of flour because in mid-winter in the Karakorum, the villagers have no spare food. In Peru, as a nine-year-old, Rachel rode a mule named Juana for the first 600 miles from Cajamarca, but a fodder shortage necessitated her walking the remaining 900 miles to Cuzco: poor Juana had become so debilitated that she could carry only our gear.\n\nIt's important to travel light. At least 75% of the equipment sold nowadays in camping shops - travel clotheslines, rolled-up camping mats, lightweight hairdryers - is superfluous. My primary basics, although it depends on the journey, are a lightweight tent, a sleeping bag suitable for the country's temperature, and a stove.\n\n6. If assisted by a pack animal, take detailed local advice about the terrain ahead.\n\nAnd remember, campsites suitable for you may be disaster areas for a hungry horse or mule. Then you must press on, often to a site hardly fit for humans, but providing adequate grazing. We can do the mind-over-matter bit, while resolving never again to let supplies run so low, but an equine helper doesn't have that sort of mind. If there's no fodder at 6.30pm, the mule cannot have consoling thoughts about stuffing it in at 6.30pm the next day. And there is nothing more guilt-provoking than seeing a pack animal who has worked hard for you all day denied sustenance.\n\n7. Cyberspace intercourse vitiates genuine escapism.\n\nAbandon your mobile phone, laptop, i-Pod and all such links to family, friends and work colleagues. Concentrate on where you are, deriving your entertainment from immediate stimuli, the tangible world around you. Increasingly, in hostels and guesthouses, one sees \"independent\" travellers eagerly settling down in front of computers instead of conversing with fellow travellers. They seem only partially \"abroad\", unable to cut their links with home. Evidently the nanny state - and the concomitant trend among parents to over-protect offspring - has alarmingly diminished the younger generation's self-reliance. And who is to blame for this entrapment in cyberspace? Who but the fussy folk back at base, awaiting the daily (even twice daily) email of reassurance.\n\n8. Don't be inhibited by the language barrier.\n\nAlthough it thwarts exchanges of ideas, it's unimportant on a practical level. I've wandered around four continents using only English and a few courtesy phrases of Tibetan, Amharic, Quechua, Albanian or whatever. Our basic needs - sleeping, eating, drinking - can always be indicated by signs or globally understood noises.\n\nEven on the emotional level, the language barrier is quite porous. People's features - particularly their eyes - are wonderfully eloquent. In our everyday lives, the extent to which we wordlessly communicate is taken for granted. In \"far-flungery\", where nobody within 100 miles speaks a word of any European language, one fully appreciates the range of moods and subtle feelings that may be conveyed visually rather than aurally.\n\n9. Be cautious - cautious as distinct from timid.\n\nThe assumption that only brave or reckless people undertake solo journeys off the beaten track is without foundation. In fact, escapists are ultra cautious: that's one of their hallmarks, and an essential component of their survival mechanisms. Before departure, they suss out likely dangers and either change their route - should these seem excessive - or prepare to deal with any reasonable hazards.\n\nGranted, there's a temperamental issue here: is a bottle half-empty or half-full? Why should your bones break abroad rather than at home? Optimists don't believe in disasters until they happen and therefore are not fearful - which is the opposite of being brave.\n\n10. Invest in the best-available maps.\n\nAnd whatever you do, don't forget your compass.\n\n* The Island That Dared: Journeys in Cuba, by Dervla Murphy (Eland, \u00a316.99)","30":"11th McKenzie Town care centre resident dies due to COVID-19 CALGARY -- An 11th resident of the McKenzie Towne Continuing Care Centre has died due to complications linked to the COVID-19 virus.\n\nA family member identified the senior as Doreen Gauvreau.

Meet 12 of the best places to see for yourself, each totally transporting (but none requiring a passport).\n\nEarly morning brings the surfers (this is a great spot for beginners); daytime means snorkeling, scuba lessons and kayaking (all particularly great from June onward, when the famed docile leopard sharks start congregating here); dusk promises spectacular shows by Mother Nature (see above). And whatever your budget, we have San Diego hotels to fit it -- including one on a private island.\n\nA stunning slice of Malibu, this beach upholds the posh local rep with (rentable) private cabanas, beach beds and lounge chairs. If you do nothing else here, have a meal at the Pacific-facing caf\u00e9, where fans of classic beach flicks may recognize the scene from the likes of How to Stuff a Wild Bikini and Beach Blanket Bingo. In fact, Tinseltown is close at hand, as you'll discover when you take advantage of these hotel deals.\n\nTucked into California's Central Coast, this little hideaway is known for striking rock formations and purple sands (the latter not always visible, but amazing when they are). Don't miss sunset through the famed keyhole in the offshore rocks, nor a hike in nearby Pfeiffer-Big Sur State Park.\n\nOregon's coastal Highway 101 connects hundreds of miles of secluded surfing spots, dramatic cliffs and quaint towns. Along the way, there's a beach to fit just about every need, but -- for natural beauty alone -- Cannon Beach is hard to beat, thanks to Haystack Rock (see above) and the surrounding title pools (you can walk right up to them at low tide to check out the resident sea stars and friends.\n\nThough the main draw is -- clearly -- the aquamarine water and its inhabitants (sea turtles, rays and all manner of tropical fish), this Culebra island beach is also home to a unique brand of street art: creatively graffiti-covered tanks -- an evocative remnant of the U.S. military presence here.\n\nWhile the Hawaiian islands are home to more edenic beaches than, arguably, the rest of the states combined, this Oahu gem is among the least touristed. Its access somewhat hard (but not impossible) to find, this is a great place to make your own any time of day, but especially at sunrise and sunset -- the Mokulua islets stunning against the glowing sky. To say aloha to Hawaii in person, check out these hotel deals, flights and vacation packages.\n\nThe barrier islands that make up the Outer Banks (or OBX, in local parlance) don't want for gorgeous beaches. But the shores around Corolla are among the few that come with an unusual and beloved bonus: wild mustangs -- presumed descendants of the horses that accompanied Spanish settlers centuries ago. For some of the best sightings, consider a tour.\n\nThough we defy you to find a stretch of this quintessential New England coastline that isn't dreamy, certain sections are particularly beloved. Main Beach, for one, is a family favorite, thanks to its public restrooms and rentable beach chairs, umbrella and floats. On the other side of the spectrum (and shoreline), the quiet and somewhat secluded Footbridge Beach is a ridiculously romantic retreat.\n\nA Chicago favorite, this sandy stretch of North Lake Shore Drive draws volleyball players, runners, sun worshippers, picnickers and architecture buffs (the shot above represents just a fraction of the famed skyline you can see from the beach). To stay and play in the Second City, check out these deals.\n\nThough the dreamy local dunes are reason enough to visit this Lake Michigan favorite, the journey may well rival the destination: To get here, take the Saugatuck Chain Ferry -- a pulley-driven system that's been crossing the Kalamazoo River since 1838 -- then climb to Mount Baldhead, take in the view, then descend onto the sand.\n\nTo swim in Caribbean-caliber water without leaving the mainland, head to Miami Beach.

The proteins are solidified and combined in numerous ways to create strands with different uses, and they're released as silk from six spinnerets. Some types of silk are used for web building, but others are made for egg cases or wrapping up prey. This simple step will keep spiders out of your house.\n\nOn most orb webs, the threads that serve as spokes are stiffer and aren't sticky. Once the structural supports are in place, the spider starts on the outside and spirals inward, attaching each segment of silk and coating the strands with a sticky substance. Once an unlucky bug gets stuck, killed, and wrapped, this design generally maintains its strength, so the spider can make minor repairs rather than having to rebuild from scratch. This is important because web-building uses a huge amount of energy for the spider. (Sometimes they eat the webs they're done with, in fact.) Don't miss these exceptionally rare National Geographic photos you won't be able to get out of your head.","33":"15 Clever Pet Products You Can Make at Home You don't have to spend a fortune to keep your pet well-fed and healthily groomed. Here are 15 products for dogs, cats, birds, and other pets that you can make yourself with ingredients you probably already have at home.\n\nYou can save big money by substituting a single ingredient -- a one-pound box of baking soda -- for a commercial dry pet shampoo. Although your pet will still need the occasional soap-and-water shampoo to remove ground-in dirt, dry shampoo will keep your dog clean and fresh-smelling during cold weather or when you're traveling. Your first step is to test for sensitivity by rubbing a little baking soda into your dog's coat between the ears (where it can't be licked off). Wait for five minutes and check for reddening or other signs of irritation. If there are none, go ahead and rub the baking soda into the dog's coat, working it in all the way to the skin. Be careful to avoid the eyes, nose, mouth, and ears. Allow the soda to remain in the coat for a full minute to absorb oil and odor. Once a minute has passed, brush the fur with a pet brush until all the baking soda and debris is removed.

Let's be honest...they are quick, easy, flavorful, filling, and so delicious! On top of that, you can easily adjust smoothies to meet your macros. Plus, they can make incredible low-calorie subs for some of those sweets you might be craving.\n\nMaybe you're wondering, are smoothies good for weight loss?\n\nYes and no. Smoothies can be great meal replacements and a way to sneak in extra protein! However, they also can lead to lots of unwanted calories if used incorrectly.\n\nYou've probably heard it said before: Don't drink your calories. In a lot of cases, that can be true. It's not necessarily that smoothies or liquid calories are bad, but it can be hard to justify a smoothie as being a meal, even if it has the calories of one. For that simple reason, some people trying to lose weight might use smoothies more as a snack than a meal, and with that could come unwanted weight gain.\n\nThat being said, smoothies are generally healthy and can be amazing at curbing cravings! On top of that, the macro profile (portion of carbs, fats, and proteins) can be spot on as well. Sometimes it actually makes more sense to reach for a copy-cat smoothie version of your favorite dessert (made out of whole ingredients that will keep you satisfied) instead of reaching for a dessert that will spike your blood sugar.\n\nBecause of these differences, we need to make a distinction between smoothies that are used as a meal vs ones that can be snuck in as a snack:\n\nMeal Smoothies\n\nThese should have a mix of fiber, protein, carbs, and fat. These types of smoothies should generally be used as a meal substitute. An 8 ounce smoothie of just fruit isn't enough to satisfy most people for long. However, this blend of macro-nutrients will ensure your body feels satiated until your next meal.\n\nWhy is that? Fiber, protein, and fat tend to be slower to digest, so your body gets a steady trickle of nutrients that will last a longer time. In contrast, pure fruit is easily digested and will quickly boost your blood sugar only to drop it soon after.\n\nSnack Smoothies\n\nThese are lower calorie and nutrient dense. In contrast to meal smoothies, these light and fresh smoothies can give you a quick boost of energy. These smoothies are an amazing way to sneak in extra greens and super-foods. However, they aren't likely to keep you feeling full for long.\n\nUse snack smoothies between meals or when you need a pick-me-up. But be mindful! Too much snacking of any kind throughout the day could still lead to too many calories.\n\nNow that you know the difference between snack and meal smoothies, dig in to my top 20 smoothie recipes! With options ranging from decadent desserts to light and fresh pick me ups, you'll find everything you need below! It's time to satisfy your cravings the healthy way!\n\nIs there anything better than that sweet and unique tang of a snickerdoodle cookie? I grew up with this cookie as an infamous family dessert (we even named our rabbits after this favorite treat). However, if you're looking to bring back that taste without the calories, all hope is not lost! This snickerdoodle smoothie registers at under 400 calories and rings in 14 grams of protein. If your looking to lower calories and sugar, there are also modifications to use stevia or monk fruit as a sweetener instead!\n\nOkay, let's be real. We all want to add a little more green into our lives. However, sometimes it can be hard to gag down. Change all of that with this 5-star smoothie recipe. Not only is this smoothie incredibly delicious, but it's also packed with nutrients. Chug those greens the easy way!\n\nThis smoothie is fresh, light, and green, giving your body the nutrient boost it needs. In addition to that, it packs a bonus boost of cilantro, which is said to aid in reducing heavy metal toxicity.\n\nThis incredible smoothie recipe not only gives you the ingredients, but also a step-by-step guide to designing your own fantastic smoothie recipes! Once you get a taste of this, you will never want to go back!\n\nIf you aren't a fan of bananas, then this one is for you! Instead, this smoothie uses zucchini as a thickening agent and buckwheat to keep you full and satisfied all day long! And for you celiacs out there...yes, buckwheat is gluten free!\n\nPart of the struggle with trying to lose weight and create healthier habits is the struggle of having to give up some of your favorite foods, like chocolate. Say no more. This chocolate mint smoothie is the perfect blend of protein and chocolate to satisfy your cravings for good! Why avoid what you love when you can indulge the healthy way?\n\nSpeaking of chocolate, give this smoothie a go! The blend of avocado and chocolate will keep you feeling satisfied and healthy all day long. Not to mention, the creaminess of this one will blow your mind.\n\nHave you ever gone to a coffee shop and felt the agonizing sting of realizing you can't order anything but a black coffee? I feel your pain. Personally, I am a huge frappuccino girl, and life without my blends sounds agonizing. Is it a smoothie? Technically no. But this recipe could easily double as one! It's lower in calories, healthier, and still delicious. Feel free to add some collagen for an added protein boost!\n\nSometimes, you don't need to venture far past the basics to find your ideal smoothie. With a base of apple juice and yogurt, this smoothie provides the best blend of sweetness and creaminess!\n\nYes! You can still have smoothies while on a keto diet. As it just so happens, berries are very low-carb! In addition to that, this smoothie uses avocado to add an extra boost of creaminess and healthy fats. This one is sure to keep you burning fat all day long!\n\nStick to the basics to get a maximum boost of nutrients! This smoothie gets straight to the point by using the best fruit medleys to blend you the ultimate weight loss drink.\n\nFeeling tired and run down? Instead of running to the coffee pot when you first wake up, try running to the blender instead! This amazing smoothie mix is an incredible way to give your body a nutrient boost while giving you the energy you need to get through the day.\n\nThis vegan recipe will have you drooling for more! It's vegan, low calorie, and delicious! What makes it different than any regular strawberry smoothie? The secret is in a butter extract that gives it a rich pastry flavor while keeping it low in calories. If you feel like leaving your chair to blend this one up right away, you are in good company.\n\nThis rich and decadent smoothie will have you feeling like you're indulging at an old fashioned ice cream parlor. This recipe is absolutely delicious and will have our cravings flying out the window. It stays deliciously smooth and creamy with the banana base and dates for an extra touch of creaminess.\n\nFair warning: this smoothie does have a slightly higher natural sugar content. However, it is much lower than going crazy and diving into a tub of Ben and Jerry's. Of course, if you feel like having a lighter version of this same drink, you can always sub a little banana and dates for zucchini and stevia.\n\nAnd here we have it! Yet another healthy smoothie version of your favorite dessert! If you're getting sick of eating oatmeal in the mornings, try using it in a shake instead! Because of the high fiber in oatmeal, it helps keep you feeling full and satiated longer while giving the smoothie a fun new texture.\n\nIf you're looking to sneak some extra greens into your day (and let's be honest, aren't we all!) this pineapple kale smoothie is for you! Not only are the ingredients incredibly nutrient dense, but they're also light and fresh. Pineapple is known for helping digestion because of an enzyme it contains called bromelain. Just for that reason, this smoothie can keep you feeling light and energized after you sip!\n\nYou don't have to be Irish to enjoy a good shamrock shake! Also, it turns out you don't have to be unhealthy for it either! This shamrock shake is made of entirely healthy ingredients and even sports Greek yogurt for an extra protein boost. Have a bowl of yogurt or a shamrock shake? It's your choice, but I know which one I would go for! And the ingredients turn out to be almost exactly identical at the end of the day.\n\nOnce again sporting Greek yogurt for a good protein boost, this smoothie could make an amazing low-calorie meal replacement. It contains yogurt, oats, chia seeds, and fruit, offering a great blend of fiber, protein, carbs, and healthy fats. Not only does it taste fantastic, but it could very well curb cravings while remaining relatively low-calorie and satiating.\n\nThe sound of having turmeric in your smoothie might make some of you cringe, but it is definitely worth trying. For one, pineapple has such a strong flavor in and of itself that the turmeric's taste is almost completely masked. Secondly, turmeric is a strong anti-inflammatory that everyone should try adding it to their diet. You might be surprised to find out that it is actually pretty tasty as well!\n\nIf you really want to take a taste of magic home, try out this fantastic recipe! Made with only two ingredients, you will get that creamy indulgent taste you love without the sugar or extra calories. Curb those cravings the right way!\n\nCheck out the recipe here!\n\nFor an extra weight loss boost, try these fun additions!\n\nSneak in greens wherever you can! Smoothies tend to be very flavorful, so you usually won't even notice a few added greens in there. However, the nutrients will keep you feeling extra energetic throughout the day!\n\nAdd in a small scoop of protein powder to almost any smoothie. Especially if you are looking for a meal replacement, the simple addition of protein powder will ensure you're staying full throughout the day!\n\nDid you hear me right? Yes you did! Zucchini is actually a great thickening agent in smoothies. Translation: Less sugar and more fiber! Since zucchini is so low in calories and almost flavorless, you can use it in smoothies for a rich and creamy texture while keeping things low-calorie. Plus, the extra fiber will have you feeling like you had a full meal for way less calories.\n\nMost smoothies use extra honey, syrups, or fruit for their sweeteners. However, that can add up very quickly to unwanted calories. Instead, try subbing low calorie sweeteners like monk fruit or stevia once in a while to cut down on the high sugar count. That being said, avoid artificial sweeteners like Splenda. They won't do you any good.\n\nTry making healthy smoothie renditions of your favorite desserts. We're only human, and it can be hard to stick to a healthy diet sometimes. Instead of giving something up, find a sub for your favorite meals! In this case, getting that amazing flavor you are craving in the form of a low-calorie smoothie could be just the thing for you!","38":"20 Sacred Spaces to Transport You Around the World Join for Free Join our 28 million members worldwide to gain access to exclusive deals and offers.\n\nFor the faithful among us, visiting a house of worship when we travel can be a way of strengthening our community ties even as we stretch them: Every church, synagogue, mosque or temple, after all, is a home away from home, filled with compatriots who'll welcome us with a mix of the familiar and the new.\n\nBut even for those of us who don't practice, these spaces reveal the transcendence of the human spirit. Often, they represent us at our best: not just in aspiration, but also in ingenuity, craftsmanship and dedication. Above all, they're places where we come together to share what matters most in life, whether for celebration or mourning. And whoever and wherever we are, they always represent hope.\n\nSo as we approach this spring holiday season, we're paying tribute to some of the most inspiring sacred spaces around the world -- places we'd visit for their spectacular beauty alone, but that, invariably, and especially in person, give us so much more.\n\nConstructed on the bones of a military post astride the passage from northern Italy to what was once southern Gaul, the Sacra di San Michele crowns Piedmont's Mount Pirchiriano like a brutally handsome sentinel. For centuries this sanctuary to the archangel Michael was occupied by the Benedictines. More recently, its dark medieval-meets-Byzantine beauty inspired Umberto Eco's murdered-monk drama The Name of the Rose. The site is currently entrusted to the Rosminians, who maintain it for anyone willing to make the climb.\n\nAfter the Romans destroyed the Second Temple in Jerusalem nearly 2000 years ago, a surviving section of retaining wall became, arguably, Judaism's most sacred site -- the lone accessible remnant of what had been the Holy of Holies. Known in Hebrew as ha'Kotel, this limestone expanse attracts millions of visitors annually, many of whom leave hand-written prayers in the cracks. And the period before Passover (which is to say, now) is one of two times a year when those notes are dutifully collected.\n\nLittle wonder this Istanbul icon is known as the Blue Mosque: More than 20,000 azure \u0130znik tiles adorn the inner walls. Commissioned by the namesake 17 century sultan to rival the neighboring Hagia Sofia, the complex also boasts hundreds of stained glass windows and six minarets -- as many as Mecca's Great Mosque is said to have had at the time. According to lore, Mecca didn't look kindly on the move, and the sultan made good by funding a seventh minaret there.\n\nTowering over Moscow's Red Square, this UNESCO World Heritage Site was originally commissioned by Ivan the Terrible in the 16th century to be the nation's tallest structure. Between the kaleidoscopic colors and patterns -- and the profusion of onion-shaped domes -- the cathedral is nothing if not distinctive. Legend even has it that the tsar blinded the architect before the building was done so the design could never be replicated.\n\nWhile borrowing liberally from Persian, Mamluk, and Indo-Islamic traditions, this masterpiece is thoroughly modern in its integration -- with bold, stark domes offset by delicately wrought pillars and mosaics. And despite being the largest mosque in Abu Dhabi -- and the busiest, especially during the upcoming Eid festivities -- the space can feel remarkably weightless thanks to the artful use of light.\n\nAny Hindu temple on the banks of the sacred Ganges -- in the pilgrimage town of Varanasi -- is going to be a big deal. But this 18-century complex (on the site of a much more ancient original) is one of only 12 Jyotirlinga, the holiest of Shiva temples, throughout India. Beyond the site's religious standing, the gold-plated domes are a major draw -- as are the gorgeous, candlelit aarti ceremonies.\n\nThe Jewish community of Djerba goes back some 2,500 years, when a group of Kohanim (priests) reportedly fled the destruction of the First Temple in Jerusalem for this Tunisian island. Though some version of El Ghriba Synagogue has stood here since antiquity -- and the current one still houses a stone said to have come from the First Temple -- the Moorish structure you see above dates to the late 1800s. And while a small local community remains, its numbers swell in the spring, when the holiday of Lag Ba'Omer brings singing and dancing pilgrims.\n\nThe most iconic element of Australia's Red Center, Uluru is sacred to the indigenous Anangu, who finally succeeded in having hiking banned on the rock late last year. But even walking around the perimeter (which is still allowed) is a staggering experience -- particularly at sunrise or sunset, when the rock takes on a preternatural glow.\n\nA modern homage to the venerable Buddhist temple that once stood on this site in Chiang Rai, Wat Rong Khun is the brainchild of Thai artist Chalermchai Kosipipat. Better known as the White Temple (for obvious reasons), the thoroughly original -- and not uncontroversial -- space juxtaposes pop cultural icons from Spiderman to Hello Kitty against traditional Buddhist themes. And whether or not you actually need it, don't miss the famed golden loo.\n\nCarved from a single rock that rises from a trench in a volcanic hillside -- and cloaked in rust and ochre bled by centuries of rain and sun -- Bete Giyorgis is the best known of the Rock-Hewn Churches of Lalibela and a once-in-a-lifetime pilgrimage site for the 45 million or so members of the Ethiopian Orthodox Christian Church. But whatever your background, you can't help but be moved here: In few other places on earth are the borders between natural and supernatural so stunningly blurred.\n\nDominating the citadel of Saladin -- and beautifying the Cairo skyline -- the so-called Alabaster Mosque is one of the best places to look out onto the sprawling city (and one of the most visited sites in Egypt). While you're there, you can also see the tomb of the 19 century ruler who commissioned the namesake mosque.\n\nZigzagging through Peru's Sacred Valley -- and paralleling almost any journey to Machu Picchu -- the river also known as the Vilcanota or Vilcamayo has long been seen by locals as a sacred reflection of the Milky Way. But even modern adventurers who've come to ride the rapids (or mountain bike along the banks) are struck with a sense of reverence.\n\nA holdover of the once-thriving Yehudey Kochin community -- the most ancient of India's Jewish populations -- this 16th-century beauty is said to be the oldest active synagogue in the Commonwealth. Active, of course, is a relative term: With very few Jews remaining in the area, and a minyan hard to come by, services are extremely rare -- but tours are easy to arrange.\n\nNear Colombia's border with Ecuador sits a Neo-Gothic basilica worth visiting for the setting alone: a dramatic river gorge, which the church surveys from about 150 feet up. But Las Lajas' backstory -- one 18-century miracle begetting another -- is equally compelling, whether you're a believer or not.\n\nThis Shiraz icon is known, almost too simply, as the Pink Mosque, thanks to the countless rosy tiles that line its interior. And while they're predictably stunning, it may well be the profusion of stained glass that pushes the viewing experience over the edge, especially in the early morning, when the light that streams through the kaleidoscopic panes turns the mosque into an out-sized jewel box.\n\nThis domed Moorish revival monument is a fixture of Berlin's skyline -- and a poignant local symbol. Originally built during the mid-1800s to serve the burgeoning Jewish community -- then heavily damaged during Kristallnacht and World War II -- the synagogue was eventually reconstructed in the late 80s and early 90s. Today, the building is home to Centrum Judaicum, a museum dedicated to history of the synagogue -- and of the greater Jewish community in Berlin.\n\nSynonymous with its thousands of vermilion torii, or gates, this ancient retreat in the mountains of Kyoto honors the Shinto spirit of rice, agriculture and commerce. And while the resulting profusion of corporate-sponsored shrines here is striking (particularly to an outsider), they don't make the hike along the 2.5-mile path any less ethereal.\n\nAnother famously pink mosque, this Putrajaya landmark is built largely of rose-tinted granite -- with room for 15,000 worshippers. But non-Muslims can visit outside of prayer times, and if you do, consider going around sunset, when the reflections on the neighboring lake are transcendent.\n\nA second stunning example of the Moorish revival architecture that was popular in the 19 century -- particularly among Central European Jewish communities -- this elaborately wrought synagogue dates to the 1860s (though a medieval predecessor once stood on the site) and is now part of Prague's Jewish Museum.\n\nFamously sprawling and unfinished, the Sagrada Familia climbs like a molten spirit dream from the center of Barcelona. And sure, the exterior, with its roiling figures spanning scriptural and artistic eras, is astonishing in scope, range, and inventiveness. But the inside's where real transcendence comes. The impression is more forest than cathedral, with columns like lithe tree reaching up to a canopy where light and shadow dance through bursts of color. Gaud\u00ed was obsessed with natural forms as manifestations of the divine, and nowhere else in his work is that so palpable -- or inspiring.","39":"20 Twin Cities restaurants serving Thanksgiving dinner This Thanksgiving, let someone else do the cooking.

You can join the conversation using #HawksRewind on social media.\n\nAfter stealing Game 1 in San Jose, the Blackhawks took care of business in Game 2 by beating the Sharks 4-2 to take a commanding 2-0 lead in the Western Conference Final. Here are three things we noticed in the win:\n\n1. Building a cushion\n\nYou knew the Sharks were going to come out hungry after losing Game 1 in their own building, and the Blackhawks certainly matched that intensity.\n\nAfter Andrew Ladd broke the scoreless tie at the 12:48 mark of the first period, Dustin Byfuglien and Jonathan Toews followed suit in the second to put the Blackhawks in front 3-0. It was crucial for the visiting team not to give the Sharks any momentum, and it wasn't until 31:08 into the game that the home team finally got on the board.\n\n2. A make-up game on special teams?\n\nThe Blackhawks had zero power plays in Game 1, so they didn't get a chance of testing a Sharks team that had the fifth-ranked penalty kill percentage (85.0) in the regular season. But that changed in Game 2.\n\nThe Sharks racked up 22 total penalty minutes and committed six minor penalties, two of which came with 18 seconds left in the game that saw two Blackhawks get sent off as well. The Blackhawks committed only one minor penalty in the previous 59:42.\n\nBoth teams converted on the power play once, but the Blackhawks staying out of the box for the majority of the game certainly played a role in preventing the Sharks from getting within striking distance or taking control early.\n\n3. Duncan Keith's strong performance\n\nHe didn't garner as much attention as others, but Keith was solid for the Blackhawks in Game 2. He recorded two assists, six shot attempts (three on goal), four blocked shots and led all skaters with 30:21 of ice time. No other skater logged more than 27:56.\n\nKeith was pointless in his first five postseason games, but had nine points (one goal, eight assists) in his next nine.\n\nAttention Dish and Sling customers!

Even though they made the Super Bowl in 2019, the San Francisco 49ers can't get content with the roster they currently have.\n\nWhile the Cardinals landed Hopkins via trade, San Francisco re-signed Arik Armstead to a five-year, $85 million contract. At the same time, they decided to trade DeForest Buckner to the Indianapolis Colts. In the trade, the 49ers were able to acquire the No. 13 pick, giving them two first-round picks.\n\nAside from the moves involving Armstead and Buckner, the 49ers haven't been an active team in free agency. Provided that, it's apparent that San Francisco is focused on addressing the needs in the 2020 NFL Draft.\n\nAfter the 13th overall pick, the 49ers also possess the 31st overall pick in the first round. Looking at the prospects that San Francisco could have at No. 13, it's possible they add a wide receiver to replace Emmanuel Sanders.\n\nOnce the 49ers make their selections in the first round, they don't have another pick until the fifth round. Taking that into consideration, there's a decent chance that San Francisco could make the 31st pick available to compile more picks. But in the event that the 49ers stay put, here is a prediction on who they will select with the No. 31 pick in the 2020 NFL Draft.\n\nTrevon Diggs (CB, Alabama)\n\nWithout a doubt, the 49ers boasted one of the best defenses in the NFL in 2019. While Kyle Shanahan managed the offense, defensive coordinator Robert Saleh rallied the defense to be the No. 2 ranked group last season.\n\nThe strength of San Francisco's defense was their pass rush with rookie Nick Bosa, Dee Ford, Armstead, and Buckner. As for their weakness, aside from Richard Sherman and Emmanuel Moseley, the 49ers could use another starter at cornerback.\n\nWith Ahkello Witherspoon struggling to show consistency, San Francisco could use the draft to find a cornerback. Among the cornerbacks that they'll be able to choose from, Trevon Diggs makes a ton of sense.\n\nDiggs, who arrived at Alabama as a wide receiver, made the transition to cornerback in his final three seasons. Just this past season, Diggs was able to record 37 tackles, eight deflections, and three interceptions.\n\nDuring his time at Alabama, Diggs excelled when he was given the chance to play in zone coverage. Given that, Diggs would be a perfect fit for Saleh's zone-centric defensive scheme. Though, there's no doubt that Diggs will need to improve as a tackler at the next level.\n\nAlso, being that Sherman is entering the final year of his contract, the 49ers need a long-term solution at cornerback. If San Francisco is actually on the clock at No. 31, Diggs would be an ideal addition to their already dominant defense.\n\nJUST IN: Broncos' Von Miller's hilarious reaction to being only remaining starter from Super Bowl 50 team Related Topics2020 NFL Draft49ersTrevon Diggs","45":"5 Creative Ways to Use Pesto Sometimes I feel like pesto gets pigeonholed as a pasta \"sauce\" when it has so many other uses!\n\nDon't get me wrong -- pasta tossed in pesto is heavenly, but it can really shine when you get creative with it!\n\nIt's one of my favorite pantry staples (along with curry paste) because it has SO much flavor in such a little jar and it's an easy way to add a lot of personality into your food.\n\nAnd that you can make pesto out of more than just basil? Like sun-dried tomatoes? Or cilantro?\n\n(Truth be told, Dill Pesto is my all-time favorite. I'm convinced dill is the most under appreciated herbs, but that's a post for another day.)\n\nFirst, entirely replace the sauce on your pizza with pesto. White pizzas are pretty popular, but GREEN pizzas are where it's at.\n\nSecond, you could mix some pesto into your pizza sauce to give it some pizzaz. I especially love stirring in a spoonful of sun-dried tomato to basic red pizza sauce.\n\nIn that ooey-gooey sandwich up there I used some sun-dried tomato pesto on my roast chicken & salami sandwich with pepperjack cheese on sourdough bread.\n\nI also made one with basil pesto mayo and it was delightful as well.\n\nAnd grilled sandwiches are always better than non-grilled. Just sayin'.\n\nRemember when I showed you how to make Sous Vide Pesto Chicken? Same idea. You could roast or grill the chicken if you're not a sous vide junkie.\n\nAnd you don't have to stick to vinaigrettes. You can add any kind of pesto to a basic creamy ranch dressing.

But for effective use of its visual effects, there are a few essential steps that one must follow.\n\nFor a more secure workflow in shooting long exposure landscapes, there are some crucial steps that one should follow for a better outcome. Keeping these five things in mind will help you come up with better output the next time you go shooting.\n\n1. Always Use a Tripod That Will Carry Your Camera With Ease\n\nThis is the most basic for any form of photography that uses long exposures. Any long-exposure image taken with a flimsy tripod, especially when there are significant environmental factors such as strong winds, water currents, or vibration of whatever you're standing on, will be ruined by the slightest shake.\n\nModern travel tripods perfectly match the payload of mirrorless camera bodies\n\nIt's important to note, however, that a sturdy tripod doesn't always mean a huge one and most definitely not an expensive one. Back in the glory days of ginormous DSLR cameras, it was almost a necessity to have a relatively big tripod because of the payload that is the heavy camera body and a significantly bulky lens makes. Nowadays, with the emergence of mirrorless cameras or even the smaller DSLR bodies, the standard for a sturdy tripod has become less in size.\n\n2. Allow the Movement to Fill a Significant Space\n\nOf course, never shoot long-exposure images if there isn't anything moving that's taking a significant space or fraction of your frame. At the very least, a moving element and its path should take about a third of your entire frame for it to have enough emphasis. Unless, of course, you're shooting with a minimalist visual design, in which case, your moving object might be the only significant object in the frame.\n\nThe rendered texture is everything in such situations\n\nIt's also possible that your moving element for a minimalist landscape photograph may be the ground element itself. Even in that case, the ground element would of course take significant space even if it would mean that the space it was taking up would appear empty.\n\nExposed for a minute to smooth the surface of the water\n\n3. Match Your Exposure Time With the Movement of Your Moving Element\n\nThis doesn't mean, of course, that you know the exact speed at which your element is moving. Instead, match your exposure time to allow for the object to cross the frame within your set exposure time. For instance, if you're shooting long exposures in the city and you want the cars to outline the road and for the light trails to be significantly solid, you have to estimate the amount of time it would take for that many cars to pass and consequently adjust your exposure settings around that specific exposure time.\n\nA 45-second exposure to capture a significant amount of light trails\n\nOn the other hand, if you're shooting fast-moving objects like crashing waves on a beach, your exposure time or shutter speed will be much faster than if you're shooting for still waters. Exposing way beyond the number of seconds that it takes for waves to crash and create swirls would simply smoothen and flatten the texture of the water, and thus, your intended effect would not be achieved. To do this in daytime would mean having the right combination of filters to allow you to set your exposure time to your desired length. Generally, shooting for textures of crashing waves goes well with a 3-stop ND filter or a 6-stop ND filter depending on the intensity of sunlight.\n\n4. Infuse Contrast With a Still Visual Element\n\nContextual contrast is essential in shooting long exposures. While the movement is your main ingredient for your visual design, this movement should be complemented by a still element to emphasize that movement. Otherwise, it would be easy to assume that the photo was blurred entirely due to a flaw and not artistic intent. However, there are certain instances where that is acceptable and aesthetically appealing, such as in abstract long-exposure landscape photographs.\n\nThe contrast of the moving clouds against the still, rough mountains\n\nLong-exposure landscapes, just like any other kind of photography, require a meticulously made composition. This means that both your moving and still elements should be strategically placed in the frame and taking up aesthetically significant spaces. Otherwise, no matter how spectacular that moment could be, your subject or significant visual elements may be perceived as unintended clutter in the corners of the frame. The most novice mistake you can make in shooting any genre of photography is to get overwhelmed by seemingly spectacular factors in your shot enough to forget about proper exposure and composition. Doing so would invalidate your subject or location, no matter how fascinating it could have been.\n\n5. Allow the Motion of Your Moving Element Dictate Your Visual Path\n\nIn working with complex compositions, such as those that deal with many layers, your moving element should lead the eyes of your viewers through those different layers. Think of it as using contrast to emphasize the presence of multiple layers in the frame. As you may already know, much of landscape photography deals with the grandiosity and the use of multiple layers in a frame would support that theme.\n\nNotice the implied S-shaped visual path leading to the volcano\n\nOn the other hand, in simpler compositions, such as those with visual paths that only move from side to side or front to back, your moving elements take an even bigger and more significant role. In the theories of visual design, it is often said that a beautiful composition is deemed pleasing to the eyes when it satisfies a certain craving for order. Out in the field, whatever you may be shooting, you're dealing with a heavily crowded space instead of an empty canvas. Being able to isolate certain chunks of those elements into a unified and aesthetically cohesive composition, emphasizing certain patterns, and the use of juxtaposition of interesting elements satisfies that craving in the minds of your viewers for order in the relatively random world.\n\nThe use of long exposures in landscape photography is almost automatic. Some even think that any landscape photograph should be shot in long exposure. That may not be true, but obviously, long-exposure techniques and the visual effects that they render spice up the visual design of the image. But, to come up with visually impactful photographs, the images should not always rely on that single moving element. Like any other photograph, every other detail, no matter the size, shape, or color is significant. How they complement your main object of interest or how they clash with it in your viewer's perception can make or break your shot, no matter how beautiful the movement is.","47":"5 Indoor Photo Projects We Love From Skillshare | Fstoppers Enjoy some online courses with a two-month trial of Skillshare Premium.\n\nWith most of the world stuck inside for a while, it's a great time to learn something new and practice new photo techniques.

Here's how to tell if your dog has it and what can be done to save his eyesight.\n\n\u0418\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u041c\u0435\u0449\u0435\u0440\u044f\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430\/Getty Images\n\nAs a loving dog owner, you do your best to take great care of your faithful friend. You make sure he has all his shots, is regularly groomed, eats nutritionally complete food, and gets plenty of exercise. But your dog's eye health may get less attention. It's important, though, to stay on top of any changes in your dog's vision and the appearance of his eyes. Like people, dogs are susceptible to a variety of eye diseases, including glaucoma.\n\nGlaucoma is the leading cause of blindness in middle-aged dogs, according to the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. And acute glaucoma, which develops suddenly, is a medical emergency, per the Veterinary Centers of America. Here's what you need to know to protect your furry family member's vision.\n\nAccording to the Veterinary Centers of America, glaucoma is a disease in which the pressure within the eye, called intraocular pressure (IOP), increases. This happens when the fluid in the eye doesn't drain properly, and it's a big problem: Increased IOP is not only painful, but it also damages the retina and optic nerve, which can rapidly lead to irreversible blindness, notes the American College of Veterinary Ophthalmologists. Eye issues are among the most common health problems in 14 popular dog breeds.\n\nGlaucoma in dogs, like other diseases, occurs more frequently with age. But regardless of how old the dog is, some breeds are predisposed to it due to an inherited abnormality in the drainage angle in the eye. Some of the affected breeds include Cocker Spaniels, Basset Hounds, Malamutes, Siberian Huskies, Elkhounds, Samoyeds, Beagles, Bouviers, Bull Mastiffs, Great Danes, Chow Chows, and Dalmatians, says DJ Haeussler, a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist.\n\nPlus, a dog that sustains an injury to the eye or has certain concurrent medical conditions -- including uveitis (inflammation of the interior of the eye), retinal detachment, or retinal degeneration -- is more likely to develop glaucoma, adds Dr. Haeussler. Intraocular cancer is another common concurrent condition. Speaking of which, these are the 12 warning signs of cancer in dogs that every owner should know.\n\nAccording to Dr. Haeussler, warning signs that your dog may have glaucoma include:\n\nThe first warning sign on the list -- the blue haze -- is the hallmark of this condition. Glaucoma in dogs can also cause considerable discomfort, so be on the lookout for indications of pain, like lethargy or loss of appetite, in combination with the above signs. Here's how to tell if your dog is in pain.\n\n\"If you notice any of these signs, you should see your primary care veterinarian as soon as possible,\" urges Dr. Haeussler. You may be referred to an ophthalmologist from there, but your vet should be your first stop.\n\nMost dogs in the beginning to middle stages of glaucoma aren't taken to the vet, though, because the early signs can be quite subtle, as Kirk N. Gelatt, VMD, explains in the Merck Veterinary Manual. That's why it's important for owners of high-risk dogs to request that their pet's IOP be measured as part of their annual physical exam.\n\nThere are various treatments available for glaucoma in dogs, Dr. Haeussler tells Reader's Digest. \"These include eye drops with the goal of reducing intraocular pressures. As well, there are advanced surgical options offered by veterinary ophthalmologists that involve laser therapies to reduce intraocular pressure, or shunt placement to drain excess fluid.\"\n\nUnfortunately, there is no cure for glaucoma in dogs, and it can be difficult to keep from advancing. Some dogs, even if treated, will lose their vision. If your dog is diagnosed with glaucoma, he will require lifelong monitoring by a veterinary ophthalmologist. But early detection, followed by immediate treatment, will give your dog the best odds of beating this disease. Next, check out these 9 trusted tips to help your pet live longer.","49":"5 Smart Home Tricks That Are Actually Impressive Photo: Alex Cranz, Gizmodo\n\nGoing to the effort of setting up a smart home just so you can turn your lights on and off from your phone may not seem like the best use of your time and resources, but with the right gear and apps you can put together some routines that really will impress family, friends, and occasional Airbnb guests. Here are five of our favourites.\n\n1) Sync your lights to your movies Screenshot: Gizmodo\n\nIf you've invested in some Philips Hue lights then you can get them changing shade and brightness in time with movies and TV shows. The end effect looks incredibly cool and could be the finishing touch to your home theatre room.\n\nIt's not difficult to do either -- all you need is the free Philips Hue Sync app for Windows or macOS. That is the one caveat about this setup: Your videos must be played on a computer (or a computer hooked up to a TV), so the program can detect what's on screen and get your lights cycling accordingly.\n\nYou need to do some prep in the mobile Philips Hue app for Android or iOS too. Open Settings, tap Entertainment areas, then choose Create area. Select the relevant room, choose some or all of the lights listed (they must have multicolor abilities), then tap Lights are ready. The app then asks you to specify the layout of your cinema room.\n\nFire up the desktop application, connect to your system, and select the entertainment area you've already configured. Pick the Video option (you can also sync to music and games), then Start light sync, and switch to your video player of choice. The buttons on the control panel let you tweak the strength of the effect.\n\n2) Turn everything off when you leave the house Screenshot: Gizmodo\n\nThe best smart home tricks should work like magic and if you use the location triggers that are available in free web service IFTTT (If This Then That), you can get all your smart home gear to respond to you leaving the house. Turn the thermostat down, make sure the lights are off, and so on. Many smart home services have this kind of geofencing built in, but we like IFTTT because it works with so many services and devices -- insuring nothing is left on that shouldn't be. So IFTTT knows where you are, you need to have the app for Android or iOS installed.\n\nAssuming you're all signed up for IFTTT and have the apps installed, from the website click your avatar (top right) then choose New Applet. Pick Location for the \"this\" trigger, then You exit an area, and locate your home on the map. Click Create trigger to finish.\n\nNext, select the \"that\" action and take your pick of smart home services: IFTTT works with SmartThings, Nest, Philips Hue, Belkin WeMo, Lifx, Ecobee and more, so the choice is yours. Unfortunately, you can't combine them all into one applet -- you need to set up a separate one for each one you want to turn off -- but when they're all configured, your home will go dark, and secure as soon as you leave.\n\nIf you've got an iPhone and use HomeKit devices, you'll soon be able to do this with Siri Shortcuts too. When iOS 12 drops (or if you've already got the beta), open up the Siri & Search menu in Settings, then tap More Shortcuts, then combine the devices you need. You'll still have to say a voice command when you leave the house, but otherwise everything will run automatically.\n\n3) Use your voice to make phone calls Photo: Adam Clark Estes, Gizmodo\n\nYou know you're in the future when you can speak out a command, apparently into thin air, and make a call with nothing but your voice (touchscreens are so last century). Thanks to the likes of the Google Home, the Amazon Echo, and the Apple HomePod, you can do this right now, today, with only a few minutes of setup required.\n\nAssuming you've set up Google Home, linked it to your Google account, got the Google Home app installed on your phone, and allowed personalizations -- full instructions here -- you can then make a call by simply saying \"call...\" followed by someone in your Google Contacts list (you can also just speak out the number). To end the call, tap on the top of your speaker, or say \"hey Google, hang up\" instead.\n\nFor an Amazon Echo, you need to tap the Conversations button (the speech bubble) in the mobile app, then enter your mobile number and follow the instructions to get calling up and running. As with Google Home, just say \"call...\" and then a contact name to place the call -- you can specify a particular number as well, like mobile, work, or office. To finish the call, say \"hang up\" at the end.\n\nFor the time being, you can't actually make calls using Apple's HomePod speaker, but you can transfer calls from your iPhone to the HomePod and use it as a speakerphone. When you're in a call, tap the Audio button on the screen, then choose your HomePod from the list. A green light appears on top of the HomePod when you're connected, and if you need to, you can use the buttons on top of it to adjust the volume.\n\n4) Find out when the kids get home Photo: August\n\nSetting up your smart home so you know exactly when the kids get back from school is really useful and not that difficult to do. It saves you worrying about where they are, saves them the hassle of texting you at the end of every school day, and can easily be adapted to suit your own home routine.\n\nYou've got a few options when it comes to this. On a basic level you can set up a motion-sensing camera like the Canary, which will buzz you as soon as a person is detected coming through the front door -- it can distinguish between people and other types of motion, and of course does plenty of other tricks too, like measuring temperature and humidity at home.\n\nIf checking a picture on your phone seems like too much effort, or you don't necessarily want to snoop so intrusively on your kids, an August Smart Lock can grant access based on a mobile device, telling you exactly who has come through the door and when. Another cool feature of this and other smart locks is being able to temporarily let family, friends, Airbnb guests and others into your home.\n\nYou also don't actually need a physical smart home device for tracking your kids -- the Life360 apps for Android and iOS will automatically ping you when your youngsters enter a certain area (like home or school), no manual effort required. That's assuming you can get them to install the app on their phones first, and they're ok with you tracking their whereabouts so consistently.\n\n5) Put your Nest camera up on the big screen Screenshot: Gizmodo\n\nPeering at the feed from your Nest security camera on your phone is fine, but to catch enough detail you really need to get the footage up on a big screen -- with the added bonus that you can quickly flick to and from your security cameras while you're lounging around on the sofa watching TV. You could even have the feed up in the background while you do something else so you never have to miss the delivery guy again.\n\nThanks to the magic of Google's various services, this is possible if you have both a Nest Cam IQ indoor camera and a Chromecast, though it's a bit more fiddly to configure than maybe it should be. First you need to open up the Nest camera app for Android or iOS on your phone, tap the feed you want to use, then tap the cog icon (top right). Choose Google Assistant and flick the toggle switch to on.\n\nNext you need to go into the Google Home app for Android or iOS (told you it was a bit convoluted), open up the app menu, and pick Home control. Tap the plus icon, choose your camera, and it should appear as a configured device. You can now control your Nest camera through Google Assistant (either on your phone or through a Google Home speaker, if you have one), so we're ready.\n\nSay \"show [camera name] on [Chromecast name]\" and as if by magic your Nest camera feed should show on whatever television set your Chromecast is connected to. If you need to give your devices names that are easier to say, you can do this through the Nest and Google Home apps. When you're done, say \"stop [Chromecast name]\" to do just that.\n\nThis article was originally published in August 2018 and has since been updated.","50":"5 Steps (And 4 Techniques) for Effective Problem Solving Productivity and Project Management blogger for at work and at home Read full profile\n\nProblem solving is the process of reviewing every element of an issue so you can get to a solution or fix it.\n\nProblem solving is a series of steps that you work through, covering multiple aspects of a problem until you can find a solution. Whether that's in a group collaboratively or independently, the process remains the same, but the approach and the steps can differ.\n\nTo find a problem solving approach that works for you, your team, or your company, you have to take into consideration the environment you're in and personalities around you.\n\nKnowing the characters in the room will help you decide on the best approach to try and ultimately get to the best solution.\n\nNo matter what the problem is, to solve it, you nearly always have to follow these steps. Missing any of these steps can cause the problem to either resurface or the solution to not be implemented correctly.\n\nOnce you know these steps, you can then get creative with the approach you take to find the solutions you need.\n\nYou must define the problem before you start, whether you're solving it independently or as a group. If you don't have a single view of what the problem is, you could be fixing something that doesn't need fixing, or you'll fix the wrong problem.\n\nSpend time elaborating on the problem, write it down, and discuss so you're clear on why the problem is occurring and who it is impacting.\n\nOnce you have clarity on the problem, you then need to start thinking about every possible solution. This is where you go big and broad as you want to come up with as many potential solutions as possible.\n\nDon't just take the first idea; build out as many as you can as the more you create, the more likely you'll find a solution that has the lowest impact on the team.\n\nWhichever solution you pick individually or as a team, make sure you think about the impact on others if you implement this solution. Ask questions like:\n\nWhen you implement the solution, be prepared for feedback, and plan for this. When you roll out the solution, request feedback on the success of the change made.\n\nMaking a change shouldn't be a one time action. Spend time reviewing the results of the change to make sure it's made the required impact and met the desired outcomes.\n\nMake changes where needed so you can further improve the solution implemented.\n\nEach individual or team is going to have different needs and may need a different technique to encourage problem solving. Try one of these to stimulate the process.\n\nThe 1-2-4-All is a problem solving approach that can work no matter how large the group is. Everyone is involved, and you can generate a vast amount of ideas quickly.\n\nIdeas and solutions are discussed and organized rapidly, and what is great about this approach is the attendees own their ideas, so when it comes to implementing the solutions, you don't have more work to gain buy-in.\n\nAs a facilitator, you first need to present the group with a question explaining the problem or situation. For example, \"What actions or ideas would you recommend to solve the company's lack of quiet working areas?\"\n\nWith the question clear for all to see, the group then spends 5 minutes to reflect on the question individually. They can jot down their thoughts and ideas on Post-Its.\n\nNow ask the participants to find one other person to discuss their ideas and thoughts with. They can be in threes if the numbers aren't even.\n\nAsk the group to move around to find a partner so they can mix with new people.\n\nAsk the pairs to spend 5 minutes discussing their shared ideas and thoughts.\n\nNext, put the group into groups of two or three pairs to make groups of 4-6. Each group shouldn't be larger than six as the chances of everyone being able to speak reduces.\n\nAsk the group to discuss one interesting idea they've heard in previous rounds, and each group member shares one each.\n\nThe group then needs to pick their preferred solution to the problem. This doesn't have to be voted on, just one that resonated most with the group.\n\nThen ask for three actions that could be taken to implement this change.\n\nBring everyone back together as a group and ask open questions like \"What is the one thing you discussed that stood out for you?\" or \"Is there something you now see differently following these discussions?\"\n\nBy the end of the session, you'll have multiple approaches to solve the problem, and the whole group will have contributed to the future solutions and improvements.\n\nThe Lightning Decision Jam is a great way to solve problems collaboratively and agree on one solution or experiment you want to try straight away. It encourages team decision making, but at the same time, the individual can get their ideas and feedback across.\n\nIf, as a team, you have a particular area you want to improve upon, like the office environment, for example, this approach is perfect.\n\nUsing sticky notes, the technique identifies major problems, encourages solutions, and opens the group up for discussion. It allows each team member to play an active role in identifying both problems and ways to solve them.\n\nMind mapping is a fantastic visual thinking tool that allows you to bring problems to life by building out the connections and visualizing the relationships that make up the problem.\n\nYou can use a mind map to quickly expand upon the problem and give yourself the full picture of the causes of the problem, as well as solutions.\n\nThe goal of a mind map is to simplify the problem and link the causes and solutions to the problem.\n\nTo create a mind map, you must first create the central topic (level 1). In this case, that's the problem.\n\nNext, create the linked topics (level 2) that you place around and connect to the main central topic with a simple line.\n\nIf the central topic is \"The client is always changing their mind at the last minute,\" then you could have linked topics like:\n\nAdding these linking topics allows you to start building out the main causes of the problem as you can begin to see the full picture of what you need to fix.\n\nOnce you're happy that you've covered the breadth of the problem and its issues, you can start to ideate on how you're going to fix it.\n\nNow start adding subtopics (level 3) linking to each of the level 2 topics.\n\nThis is where you can start to go big on solutions and ideas to help fix the problem.\n\nFor each of the linked topics (level 2), start to think about how you can prevent them, mitigate them, or improve them. As this is just ideas on paper, write down anything that comes to mind, even if you think the client will never agree to it!\n\nThe more you write down, the more ideas you'll have until you find one or two that could solve the main problem.\n\nOnce you run out of ideas, take a step back and highlight your favourite solutions to take forward and implement.\n\nThe five why's can sound a little controversial, and you shouldn't try this without prepping the team beforehand.\n\nAsking why is a great way to go deep into the root of the problem to make the individual or team really think about the cause. When a problem arises, we often have preconceived ideas about why this problem has occurred, which is usually based on our experiences or beliefs.\n\nStart with describing the problem, and then the facilitator can ask \"Why?\" fives time or more until you get to the root of the problem.\n\nIt's tough at first to keep being asked why, but it's also satisfying when you get to the root of the problem.\n\nAs a facilitator, although the basic approach is to ask why, you need to be careful not to guide the participant down a single route.\n\nTo help with this, you can use a mind map with the problem at the center. Then ask a why question that will result in multiple secondary topics around the central problem. Having this visual representation of the problem helps you build out more useful why questions around it.\n\nOnce you get to the root of the problem, don't forget you must be clear in the actions to put a fix in place to resolve it.\n\nTo fix a problem, you must first be in a position where you fully understand it. There are many ways to misinterpret a problem, and the best way to understand them is through conversation with the team or individuals who are experiencing it.\n\nOnce you're aligned, you can then begin to work on the solutions that will have the greatest impact.\n\nFor the more significant or more difficult problems to solve, it's often advisable to break the solution up into smaller actions or improvements.\n\nTrial these improvements in short iterations, and then continue the conversations to review and improve the solution. Implementing all of these steps will help you root out the problems and find useful solutions.","51":"5 best free agent signings in Seattle Seahawks history The Seattle Seahawks started as an expansion team in 1976 and since the beginning, they have done a good job of bringing in talent through free agency. Let's take a look at the five best free-agent signings in Seahawks history.\n\nWarren Moon\n\nWarren Moon is one of the biggest free-agent signings in history, not just because of what he has done on the field, but also how much he means to the organization. Moon played for the University of Washington and before the 1997 season, he signed with the Seahawks. During the 97 season, Moon threw 25 touchdowns and 3,678 yards.\n\nMoon also played the 1998 season with the Seahawks starting ten games. Moon left the team after the season and played his last two seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs. Moon is still involved with the team, and he was later inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nBobby Engram\n\nAfter spending the first five seasons with the Chicago Bears, Bobby Engram signed with the Seahawks before the 2001 season and he was Mr. consistent. In 2007, Engram caught 94 passes for 1,147 yards and six touchdowns. The 94 receptions broke the team record for catches in a season.\n\nAfter the 2008 season, Engram left to play for one season with the Kansas City Chiefs where he played in only five games starting zero of them. After the season Engram hung up the cleats and retired from the NFL but he s still considered one of the best wideouts in franchise history.\n\nMichael Bennett\n\nIn terms of first contract signed, Michael Bennett is one of the biggest steals of any team. The Seahawks signed Bennett to one year, $5 million deal in 2013 and he was a big reason they were able to win the Super Bowl later that year. Bennett ended up signing a four-year deal during after the 2013 season and he played with the team through the 2017 season.\n\nOnce his playing career is over, there is no reason Bennett shouldn't be honored by the team in a big way.\n\nChris Gray\n\nThe Seahawks offensive line was strong in the 2000s and one of the biggest reasons for the success was the play of the offensive line. Gray signed with the Seahawks prior to the 1998 season, and by 2000 he was a full-time starter at right guard.\n\nThe rest of the Seahawks offensive line was strong, which made many overlook the play of Gray, but there is no doubt he was part of the glue that held the entire offense together.\n\nGray made 121 consecutive starts for the Seahawks before hanging up the cleats before the 2008 season.\n\nCliff Avril\n\nCliff Avril was signed one day before Bennett, and he was also a key part of the defense that helped them win a Super Bowl. Between 2003 and 2006, Avril had 33.5 sacks and helped the team have one of the best defenses in football.\n\nIn May of 2018, Avril was released by the Seahawks, but in the short time he spent with the team, he proved why he was one of the best signings by the team in free agency.\n\nJUST IN: Rams coach Sean McVay's straightforward response on his favorite Tiger King character Related TopicsSeahawks","52":"5 best things our food critic ate in Twin Cities this week From Lent-inspired fish sandwiches to a once-a-year indulgence, here's a rundown of my dining diary's greatest hits from the past seven days. What were your top eats of the week? Share the details in the comments section.\n\nWith Lent comes fish fry. I recently compiled a list of 16 Twin Cities restaurant versions, and the Catholic Spirit helpfully chronicles 93 metro area (and beyond) no-meat suggestions at churches and Knights of Columbus locations. For those who prefer to rely upon the ease and affordability of the fried fish sandwich, this is probably my new local go-to ($10.75). At its center is a preposterously generous, spear-like slab of mild, beer-battered tilapia - the contrast between crisp, golden battered coating and tender, white, steaming fish is spot-on - and it's served in a first-rate bun that gets the buttered-and-toasted treatment. Instead of a sweet tartar sauce, chef\/co-owner Sameh Wadi swerves in the opposite direction, inserting some much-needed heat into the proceedings. He breaks down - and then ramps up -- all of the flavors of classic Old Bay seasoning - and uses them as a basis for a house-made mayonnaise that he's dubbed \"New Bay.\" A side salad-like amount of shredded iceberg lettuce inserts a cool, crunchy note, and for added texture Wadi tosses in super-thin, super-crisp and super-salty (in a good way) potato chips. \"I love fish sandwiches!\" said Wadi. \"When we opened World Street Kitchen, [chef de cuisine] Matt Eisele and I wanted to make a down-and-dirty version and wanted it to be bold flavored, but not with strong fish flavor. New Bay is a favorite of mine, so it was a starting point, then lettuce and homemade crispy kettle-style chips made sense.\" Agreed. Stop by during happy hour (3 to 5 p.m. and 9 to 11 p.m.), when the bar knocks $2 off tap beers and $3 off house wines. 2743 Lyndale Av. S., Mpls., 612-424-8855\n\nMy digestive tract still protests the indignity it suffered during the afternoons I devoted to sampling nine fast-food fish sandwiches for a best-to-worst rundown (find the 2019 version here). I'm not repeating that perilous duty in 2020, but for this Lenten season I'll continue to heartily endorse my No. 1 pick from the previous two years, which remains a fast-food fish sandwich role model ($7.75, and $6.75 on Friday during Lent). The type of fish isn't specified, but it's a substantial squared-off portion that sports a notably appealing contrast between interior (snowy-white and flaky) and exterior (a browned, splendidly crunchy coating). The bun teeters toward the generic, but it's redeemed by a swipe of honest-to-goodness butter before it gets a warm, golden toast. The straightforward garnishes stick to a generous handful of chopped iceberg lettuce and the sandwich's one true demerit, a snoozer of a tartar sauce. Riddle me this: the house pickles here are delicious; would financial ruination rain down if some were chopped and added to this dull-as-dishwater mayo that's masquerading as tartar sauce? As for the price ($7.75), it's higher than average because it includes a heaping handful of (pretty great) French fries. This 16-year-old homegrown chain now operates seven Twin Cities locations, including 1330 Wayzata Blvd., Wayzata, 952-476-2319\n\nThe James Beard award semifinalists were announced on Wednesday. As always, Minnesota chefs and restaurants were showered with recognition, including Grand Cafe chef\/owner Jamie Malone, who is in the running for Best Chef: Midwest honors. As well she should be. I mean, just one look - and one taste - of this extraordinary omelet should be enough to earn Malone a berth on this list of high achievers. Despite its $35 price tag (which sounds outrageous but so isn't), it's an impressive display of economy, technical agility, culinary artistry and unabashed decadence. The cool sweetness of the tender crab is a fine foil for the over-the-top richness of the butter sauce, and Mary Cassatt herself couldn't have better matched the butter's intense burst-of-sunshine color with the omelet's rich, golden hue. It's one of the Twin Cities' great dishes. 3804 Grand Av. S., Mpls., 612-822-8260\n\nNow ensconced in a Lowertown space directly across from the St. Paul Farmers Market, this intriguing restaurant is clearly catering to the residents of its new neighborhood by serving an eclectic menu - sweet tea-brined chicken with collard greens, a half-dozen novelty burgers, grilled pineapple-enriched guacamole - at neighborhood-friendly prices. Of special note is the emphasis on vegetarian (and occasionally vegan) options. I loved the hummus: it's dense but still spreadable (across thick slices of grilled sourdough bread), and topped with compare-contrast garnishes that include brown butter, tangy\/sweet pickled golden raisins and crunchy, well-seasoned fried chickpeas. 275 E. 4th St., St. Paul, 651-424-1080\n\nFor some, it's Do-Si-Dos, for others, it's Samoas. My cravings reliably zoom toward the combination of mint and chocolate with the intensity of a heat-seeking missile (I firmly believe that Pearson's Mint Patties rank as one of the greatest candies ever made), which is why my waistline is grateful that Thin Mints are a brief once-a-year phenomenon. My favorite part of a recent transaction was the conversation I shared with an extremely outgoing Girl Scout\/future hedge fund shark. When I told her that I'd be back in a moment - I was headed to a nearby ATM to pick up cash for the purchase - she didn't skip a beat. \"We accept credit cards,\" she said, holding out her hand. Sold. Try as I might, my Thin Mints stash has a relatively short shelf life (is there a cookie that freezes better?), which is why I have found myself turning to a bake-at-home replication. Verdict? Not bad. Not the can't-eat-just-one quality of the real thing, but not bad, and relatively easy to make. A final note: the Girl Scouts website offers all kinds of recipe ideas that incorporate their cookies. I'll definitely be making Mile-High Peppermint Pie, because it merges three of my obsessions: Thin Mints, ice cream pie and meringue. It does require, however, hanging onto a box of Thin Mints until it can be prepared. Easier said than done.","53":"5 bold predictions for Miami Dolphins in 2020 Brian Flores saved his job by making a late run to push the Dolphins to a 5-11 finish. He'll be hard pressed to match that feat in 2020.\n\nThe Dolphins managed to scratch and claw their way to five wins last year, but make no mistake about it, this is one of the weakest rosters in the NFL. In particular, the offense may require a complete overhaul before it's ready to look like a competent attack.\n\nThe fact that Ryan Fitzpatrick led Miami in both rushing attempts and yards last season is one of 2019's most amazing statistics. It's safe to assume a running back will manage to best him in both departments in 2020. Figuring out which guy might emerge as the leader of that group is an interesting thought exercise.\n\nAt least fans can hold out some optimism that their favorite team can draft a superstar with the No. 5 overall pick in the draft. Finding a quarterback to build around should be the franchise's top priority. That's the only hope the Dolphins have of sniffing the playoffs anytime soon.\n\nDespite that dreary outlook, here are five bold predictions about how things will play out for Miami in 2020.\n\nInjuries and the lack of the team's competitiveness limited Howard to just five games a season ago. That leaves Howard with a lot to prove in 2020. He's got the talent and drive to have a stellar season in spite of his team's record.\n\nHoward will be 27 next season which means he should be at or near the absolute peak of his NFL career. When healthy, he's one of the few shutdown corners left in the league. That skill is going to show up on film even when his team is losing games.\n\nAs a result, Howard will get a lot of individual praise for his play. It should be enough to get him All-Pro honors. That should help boost his trade value before he tries to get out-of-town next offseason.","54":"5 things to know from Surgeon General Jerome Adams Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams told the \"CBS Evening News\" on Monday that he's \"hopeful\" the U.S. will have fewer than the originally projected deaths from COVID-19. This came after Dr. Adams had painted a grim picture over the weekend, telling Fox News \"this is going to be the hardest and saddest week of most Americans' lives, quite frankly,\" and \"this is going to be our Pearl Harbor moment, our 9\/11 moment.\" Here are our top takeaways from that interview:\n\nEmerging data shows that the fatality rate for black Americans with COVID-19 is higher than for other ethnic and racial groups. This is particularly pronounced in Chicago, where public radio station WBEZ found that African Americans made up 70% of fatal COVID-19 cases, but only 29% of the general population. \"In far too many communities, being black is a risk factor for complications from COVID-19,\" Dr. Adams said.\n\nOn Monday, New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo said that the curve in the state may be beginning to flatten. Dr. Adams told us, \"This is the first glimmer of hope for New York, New Jersey, and we hope that the trend continues, but it's going to mean that everyone has to keep doing their part.\n\nAfter promising news out of New York that the curve could be flattening, Dr. Adams suggested that the U.S. may not reach the projected 100,000-240,000 deaths from COVID-19. \"I am hopeful that we won't reach that peak,\" he told us. \"And I'm hopeful because the projections that we have been working with were based on data from other countries. We are seeing more and more data come in from the United States and that's been forming these projections in a new and better way.\"\n\nAs politicians and public health officials debate possible treatments for COVID-19, Dr. Adams told us \"I don't think that this epidemic is going to be ended by a miracle drug or therapeutic.\"\n\n\"You're not going to treat your way out of this problem, you're not going to supply or ventilate your way out of this problem,\" he said. \"The way we get out of this problem is by lowering demand. It's by good, old-fashioned public health. I don't want people to take their eyes off the fact that the most important thing right now is mitigation and social distancing and good hygiene.\"\n\nAs the situations in New York and New Jersey show signs of possible improvement, we asked the Surgeon General which cities are emerging as potential problem areas with respect to the virus. \"We know New Orleans has not hit their peak yet. They're a hotspot,\" Dr. Adams said. \"We know that Michigan is really struggling, particularly in the Detroit area. ... And from a supply point of view, we send a lot of our supplies and resources to New York, once they hit their peak, they will be redeployed to other areas, and we ultimately can't afford to have 15, 20, 30 hotspots at once because that could overwhelm our ability to be able to respond.\"","55":"500-year-old manuscript contains earliest known use of the \"F-word\" The Bannatyne Manuscript is an anthology of some 400 medieval Scottish poems.\n\nScotland has much to recommend it: impressive architecture, gorgeous Highlands, and a long, distinguished intellectual tradition that has spawned some of the Western world's greatest thinkers over several centuries. It's also, apparently, home to a medieval manuscript that contains the earliest known usage of the swear word \"F#$%.\"\n\nThe profanity appears in a poem recorded by a bored student in Edinburgh while under lockdown as the plague ravaged Europe -- something we can all relate to these days. The poem is getting renewed attention thanks to its inclusion in a forthcoming BBC Scotland documentary exploring the country's long, proud tradition of swearing, Scotland -- Contains Strong Language.\n\nThe Bannatyne Manuscript gets its name from a young 16th-century Edinburgh merchant named George Bannatyne, who compiled the roughly 400 poems while stuck at home in late 1568, as the plague ravaged his city. It's an anthology of Scottish literature, particularly the texts of poems by some of the country's greatest bards (known as makars) in the 15th and 16th centuries. According to a spokeswoman for the National Library of Scotland (where the manuscript is housed), \"It has long been known that the manuscript contains some strong swearwords that are now common in everyday language, although at the time, they were very much used in good-natured jest.\"\n\nThe five sections to the compilation are devoted to religious themes, moral or philosophical themes, love ballads, fables and allegories, and comedy, especially satire. The latter section is where one is most likely to encounter the swears, particularly in the poetry of William Dunbar and Walter Kennedy. Both poets feature in the poem where the notorious F-word appears: \"The Flyting of Dunbar and Kennedie.\"\n\nWTFlyting?\n\nFlyting is a poetic genre in Scotland -- essentially a poetry slam or rap battle, in which participants exchange creative insults with as much verbal pyrotechnics (doubling and tripling of rhymes, lots of alliteration) as they can muster. (It's a safe bet Shakespeare excelled at this art form.)\n\nDunbar and Kennedy supposedly faced off for a flyting in the court of James IV of Scotland around 1500, and their exchange was set down for posterity in Bannatyne's manuscript. In the poem, Dunbar makes fun of Kennedy's Highland dialect, for instance, as well as his personal appearance, and he suggests his opponent enjoys sexual intercourse with horses. Kennedy retaliates with attacks on Dunbar's diminutive stature and lack of bowel control, suggesting his rival gets his inspiration from drinking \"frogspawn\" from the waters of a rural pond. You get the idea.\n\nAnd then comes the historic moment: an insult containing the phrase \"wan fukkit funling,\" marking the earliest known surviving record of the F-word.\n\nOf course, as the BBC Scotland documentary notes, that first \"F#%$\" is nothing compared to author James Kelman's 1994 stream-of-consciousness novel, How Late It Was, How Late. The work is noteworthy not just because it won the Booker Prize and is written in a lowbrow Scottish dialect, but also because it uses the F-word over 4,000 times. Bannatyne would be proud of the legacy his first \"F$#%\" wrought.","56":"6 Powerful Sales Techniques Even Non-Salespeople Should Master Jeremy is a lawyer and entrepreneur.

Whether it is trying to get your coworkers to back up your ideas or convincing your spouse why your restaurant pick is the better choice, we are constantly selling ourselves.\n\nKnowing some good sales techniques is not only a salesperson skill, but it is also a life skill. If you walk into a job interview feeling confident and knowing how to sell yourself to the employer, you are going to have an advantage over the competition. From dating to getting a loan or landing a promotion, learning how to put solid sales techniques into practice can be a real benefit.\n\nSelling comes naturally to some people, but for others, it can feel awkward and even insincere or opportunistic. If you are unsure of your own sales skills, here are some game-changing sales techniques that will not leave you feeling like a slimy snake oil salesman.\n\nBefore we jump into sales techniques and practices, you must first change your perception of what sales is and is not. Sales techniques are not about pushing somebody into something they do not need, want or cannot afford.\n\nTake the word \"selling\" out of your vocabulary for a second and replace it with \"motivating\" because that is what you are doing. Selling is motivating somebody to take action.\n\nLearning how to motivate others to take action that benefits both you and them will pay dividends throughout all stages of your life. To motivate others to take action, you have to actively listen to their needs and know the right way to persuade them into taking that desired course of action.\n\nSlicking your hair back, throwing on a pair of mirrored sunglasses, and adopting the loud-mouthed and pushy approach is not the way to go about this.\n\nSo, what works?\n\nThis might sound obvious, but it can be easy to mess up. Knowing the customer means listening genuinely. Research shows most people are not the greatest at active listening. We might seem like we are listening, but we are really just waiting to talk.\n\nLearning to be an active listener takes some practice, but it can help you better know the hypothetical customer that you are selling to. Bill Clinton might not have been a salesman, but he probably would have been a great one. The former president was known for being such a good listener that he made whoever he met feel like they had his undivided attention.\n\nThe best salespeople take a genuine interest in the problems that need to be solved. If you fail to know the customer, the rest of your sales pitch is going to be a real uphill climb.\n\nListening is only part of the battle. There is also preparation. Whether you are trying to sell yourself at a job interview or pitch an idea, going in unprepared is just foolish. Both teams in the Super Bowl know the strengths and weaknesses of the other team. They study their plays and develop a strategy long before the coin toss.\n\nDo some research on your intended audience, and learn to understand what drives and motivates them. You want to find something that allows you to connect with them and speak their language. People want to work with those who they like and who understand their needs.\n\nA big part of learning how to motivate somebody is to communicate what's in it for the other person. You already know what's in it for you, but you need to put yourself in their shoes. You have to convince them why they should hire you for the job or sign on to your idea.\n\nDo not focus on your own agenda, but focus on why it is in their best interest to agree with you. When people buy from a salesperson, they do not do it because they want to make the salesperson happy. They do it because they have a need or problem that requires a solution. It is your job to understand that need and tailor your message to meet their needs.\n\nThis is where some of that research and preparation we discussed comes into play. The better you know the other person's problem or goal they are trying to reach, the better you can convey how your background, talents, and ideas make you the right person for the job.\n\nWe've all heard of the expression \"don't let them see you sweat.\" This is sometimes easier said than done, however, and nerves have a real way of throwing a monkey wrench in a sales pitch. There is no magic solution to keeping your cool, but there are certainly a few things that you can do that will help.\n\nPractice what you want to say. This does not mean that you need to memorize verbatim every word of what you plan to say. Nobody likes the feeling that they are being lectured to. Just take a few minutes to get a feel for how your pitch feels coming out of your mouth. The pitch for an idea might sound great in your head, but it may feel disjointed rolling off the tongue.\n\nEven with some practice, it is easy to find yourself in the middle of trying to convey your great idea when the adrenaline kicks in and starts to get the best of you. This is often around the time that people start to get flustered and find themselves rambling or bragging. This sort of thing is a real turn off, and the person you are speaking to will pick up on this.\n\nSlow down for a second and do your best to be conscious of your tone and speed. Take a deep breath and carry on.\n\nIf you want to get that final yes at the end of your sales pitch, it helps to shoot for smaller yes's along the way. This helps with psychologically establishing a connection with others. It allows them to see your point of view and why your idea is a good one.\n\nIn the 1960s, a team of psychologists wanted to explore what would become known as the foot-in-the-door technique. The canvased a neighborhood and asked each house if they could put a large \"Drive Carefully\" sign in the front yard. Only 20 percent of the residents agreed.\n\nThe researchers went back a few days later and asked if the residents would agree to put a much smaller sign in their window. More people agreed to this smaller request.\n\nWhen the researchers returned a few weeks later, 76 percent of the residents agreed to put the larger sign in their yards.\n\nSo what does this mean?\n\nBy getting a yes to a smaller request first, you are establishing a connection and asking the other person to make a smaller mental commitment. While trying to motivate somebody, ask them questions along the way that touch upon their need or problem and result in a \"yes.\" By doing this, they are that much more likely to give you a final \"yes\" at the end.\n\nAlright, you have listened to the customer, kept your cool and conveyed a message that speaks to their needs. Now, it is time to close the deal. A lot of salespeople try to create a sense of urgency with a now or never approach. This can come off as both pushy and desperate.\n\nYes, the idea that you are discussing may indeed relate to a specific deadline, but being too pushy can backfire pretty easily.\n\nIt is rare for somebody to immediately say yes right away. Everyone has their own set responsibilities, and people often need a bit of time to think things over.\n\nIt is always a good idea to ask the other person if they have any questions about what was discussed or if they have any concerns about moving forward. This gives you a chance to clear things up.\n\nFinally, ask if you can follow up at a specified point in the future. This avoids leaving things open-ended and allows you some time to tweak your message.\n\nRemember that good sales technique is not about trying to push somebody into something that is not right for them. It is about understanding their needs and conveying why you have an effective solution.\n\nIf you can master the sales techniques outlined above, you will succeed even if you never technically sell anything.","57":"7 Credit Card \"Rules\" You Can Break in an Emergency As they say, rules were made to be broken, and that's especially true when something can be an absolute lifesaver during a financial crisis.\n\nMuch of the advice you see about using credit cards wasn't written for people coping with a financial emergency. When you're faced with a sudden disruption in your income -- something millions of people are experiencing because of the COVID-19 pandemic -- some of the basic \"rules\" about credit cards become unrealistic, if not impossible, to follow.\n\nIt's not that the rules aren't sound advice. When times are good and you're living within your means, using credit carefully, you shouldn't be carrying debt month to month, for example, and you should be angling to get maximum value from your credit card rewards.\n\nBut times aren't always good.\n\nThe whole point of having access to credit is that you can tap it when you need it, and practicing good credit habits in good times means you'll have flexibility when disaster strikes.\n\nCredit cards aren't a substitute for income, but in an emergency, you can use them to survive a disruption in your income. That means giving yourself permission to break a few of the \"rules\" until the crisis passes. Here are seven of them.\n\nWhy you can break it in an emergency: Credit card debt is expensive, but if the alternative is to go without necessities, or if you need to preserve cash for the things you can't get with credit, the cost may be worth bearing.\n\nThis \"rule\" stems from the high-interest rates most credit cards charge on balances you carry from one month to the next. When you pay in full, you aren't charged interest. But carrying balances means paying interest at annual rates that can exceed 20%. Carrying debt at that rate over a long period can be extremely expensive. But in a crisis, we might be not talking about a prolonged period. In a short-term cash crunch, paying less than the full monthly credit card total can help you stretch your resources.\n\nSay you have a credit card bill of $1,500 with an APR of 20%. Pay off just $500, rather than the full balance, and the remaining $1,000 will cost you about $17 in interest for a month. Whether that's an acceptable price to pay depends on your individual situation, but it's not \"wrong\" to accept it. One idea to consider, though: Call your credit card issuer and ask for a break on your interest rate, at least in the short term, or for the option to delay your payment. Financial crisis or not, these are the things you should always pay for with a credit card.\n\nWhy you can break it in an emergency: Paying only the minimum keeps your account in good standing when access to credit is critical. It won't do much to reduce your debt, but it can help you stay afloat.\n\nThe minimum payment specified on your credit card statement is typically just a small percentage of what you owe, enough to cover the previous month's interest and a bit of the principal. Paying just the minimum won't make much of a dent in your debt, and if you make a habit of it, you'll be in debt longer.\n\nIn a crisis, however, budgets and priorities shift. If your choice is between paying more than the minimum due or using that extra money to buy groceries, pay your mortgage or cover utility bills, then deferring your credit card payoff until next month or beyond might be the right choice.\n\nIt's only temporary relief, but making the minimum payment on time each month will keep your account open, and you'll avoid incurring late fees or penalty APRs. You can attack the debt more vigorously once the crisis passes.\n\nWhy you can break it in an emergency: Using \"too much\" of your available credit can pull down your credit scores, but the damage isn't permanent.\n\nCredit utilization refers to how much of your available credit is in use. It's a major factor in your credit scores, and the lower your utilization, the better for your scores. In normal times, it's best to keep it below 30%, and staying under 10% is even better.\n\nBut going over the utilization threshold doesn't do lasting damage to your credit score the way a missed payment does. (Current scoring models look at your current utilization, not utilization history.) And using a higher percentage of your available credit for a period of time could be exactly what you need to do to buy groceries and other essentials during an emergency. When the worst passes and you're able to get your utilization back down, your scores can recover.\n\nWhy you can break it in an emergency: If you need money just to make ends meet, it doesn't make sense to sit on hundreds of dollars' worth of rewards, even if converting them to cash means getting less value per point than using them for something else.\n\nWhen you're financially secure, it's smart to redeem credit card rewards only for the most valuable option. Travel credit cards, for example, usually offer more value per point when you use your rewards to pay for travel than when you redeem them for cash or for a credit on your statement. In an emergency, though, travel may not be a priority. And in this pandemic, it might not even be an option. Stockpiling travel rewards for the future makes little sense if you're struggling in the present.\n\nGive yourself permission to redeem rewards for cash, even at a lower value, to pay for essentials or start an emergency fund. It might sting to cash in points for 1 cent apiece when you could get, say, 1.25 cents by redeeming them for travel, but $500 in cash can be much more useful in a crisis than $625 worth of hypothetical travel. Don't miss these 15 credit card perks you didn't know existed.\n\nWhy you can break it in an emergency: Not everyone has been able to stash money in a contingency fund, and when disaster strikes, it's often too late to start. You may have to lean on your credit to get through.\n\nThe rule of thumb when it comes to emergency savings is to stash away enough money to cover three to six months' worth of living expenses. If your income is interrupted and your bills are piling up, an emergency fund can keep you afloat. But according to Federal Reserve data from May 2019 -- well before COVID-19 threw people's finances into chaos -- 4 in 10 adults in the U.S. lacked the ability to cover the cost of a $400 emergency expense, either with cash or a credit card they could pay off in full when the bill came.\n\nThe reality is that expenses continue to pile up whether you have savings or not. If you need money to bridge a gap, your credit cards can provide some spending power. Yes, credit cards charge interest on any balance you carry. But the interest rate on purchases is much lower than what you'd pay on a payday loan or, usually, a credit card cash advance. Once your situation becomes more stable, you can begin to pay down your debt as aggressively as your budget allows. Here's how one couple stayed afloat when both of them lost their jobs in the same week.\n\nWhy you can break it in an emergency: Transferring a high-interest balance to a credit card with a 0% introductory APR period can buy time when you need to preserve your cash for necessities. The debt must eventually be paid, but that can wait.\n\nMaking the most of a balance transfer generally means paying off the transferred debt during the 0% APR period, before the regular interest rate kicks in. If a card gives you 15 months at 0% APR on balance transfers, for example, you could avoid interest completely by paying off the debt within that time frame.\n\nBut in a crisis, when preserving cash is a top priority, making the most of a 0% APR period looks different. In situations like these, when you need to buy time and hold on to cash, it can make sense to pay just the minimum amount due each month. That might mean reaching the end of a 0% period with a balance still outstanding and paying the ongoing interest rate, or moving the debt again and paying another 3% to 5% balance transfer fee. But for the duration of the crisis, you can focus on staying financially afloat and covering basic expenses.\n\nWhy you can break it in an emergency: You build good credit so that you can fall back on it when you need it. This is when you need it.\n\nYour credit score isn't a trophy. It's a tool.\n\nBuilding and maintaining good credit is important, but it's a means to an end -- having access to credit when you need it. If you can't tap your credit in bad times, if you can't benefit from all the work you put in to establish good credit, then that good credit score doesn't carry much value.\n\nIn an emergency, you shouldn't prioritize your credit score overfeeding your family, over keeping a roof above your head, over being safe. If you need to take action that hurts your credit -- running up a high balance to cover necessities, applying for a new card or even missing a payment -- so be it. There are steps you can take to minimize the damage, such as calling your card issuer to discuss reducing payments or requesting a credit card limit increase. Make use of your options, but in the end, your score can recover. For now, just do what it takes to get through. Once this crisis has passed, here's how you can improve your credit score and fix your credit.\n\nNerdWallet writers Melissa Lambarena, Sara Rathner, Erin El Issa, Kenley Young and Paul Soucy contributed to this article.","58":"7-Eleven That's Hockey Online: April 6th Finding some light and hope out of darkness and despair","59":"8 Minnesota chefs and 3 restaurants named 2020 James Beard awards semifinalists Eight Twin Cities chefs and three restaurants have been named 2020 semifinalists in the James Beard Foundation awards.\n\nThe high-profile awards, widely viewed as the industry's highest honors, recognize and celebrate excellence across 23 categories.\n\nIn the Beard's highly competitive national awards, Twin Cities chefs and restaurants made the cut in six out of 11 categories, including:\n\nOutstanding Chef: Gavin Kaysen of Spoon and Stable in Minneapolis.

That decision took almost an hour. There was finger-pointing and bristling and no one has even talked about what's in the legislation yet.\n\nWe're in for a wild ride, folks.\n\nTo back up: It's been about two years since the notorious employee hours tax, or head tax, was passed and then quickly repealed by the Seattle City Council. A new business tax -- this time a tax on Seattle businesses with more than $7 million in annual payroll -- has been proposed by Councilmembers Tammy Morales and Kshama Sawant.\n\nThe Tax Amazon legislation, as Sawant and Morales have called it, is a package of three bills introduced to the council today.\n\nThe legislation would put a 1.3 percent tax on the payroll of the 800 biggest Seattle businesses and, in doing so, raise around $500 million. In an effort to alleviate some of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on Seattleites, the money from a tax for the remainder of this year -- at this point around $200 million -- would give 100,000 Seattle households $500 once a month for four months. In 2021, the full $500 million will be used to build social housing and to help buildings follow tenets of the Seattle Green New Deal.\n\nBut first, the council had to decide which council committee the legislation would be referred to.\n\nLegislation has to be voted on and passed in a committee before it is heard and voted on in a full council meeting. Sawant wanted the legislation to be referred to the Sustainability & Renters' Rights committee that she chairs and Morales co-chairs. Sawant wanted her committee in charge \"to allow the [Tax Amazon] movement to have a voice.\"\n\nOther councilmembers were not too keen on this. There are only five members in Sawant's committee and she and Morales would make up two out of five of the votes.\n\nLast week, Council President Lorena Gonzalez had already told Sawant no, she wouldn't be allowed to have the legislation heard in her committee. Instead, Gonzalez decided to refer Sawant's and Morales' \"revenue legislation\" to the Select Budget Committee chaired by Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda.\n\n\"The Select Budget Committee includes all nine councilmembers,\" Gonzalez told The Stranger in an email, \"and by previous unanimous consent of this Council, is approved to hear all legislation pertaining to revenue generation and the City's budget.\"\n\nGonzalez continued: \"This legislation is, at its core, a revenue bill that is appropriately considered by the committee responsible for City finances.\"\n\nSawant still tried to get the legislation sent to her own committee. That motion failed. A motion by Morales to get the legislation sent to the budget committee passed unanimously.\n\n\"I'm sort of bristling,\" Councilmember Lisa Herbold commented, \"at the idea that the only way we'll pass a strong progressive revenue bill is if it's in the committee of Councilmember Sawant. This is promoting the idea of a divided council.\" She didn't think that it was helpful, particularly in the midst of a crisis, to promote that picture of how the council does its business.\n\nAs expected, Sawant bit back. First, she clarified that the reason she wanted the tax to be heard in her committee was because of how the council flip-flopped on the head tax back in 2018.\n\n\"Many council members voted to repeal the Amazon Tax in 2018 and that was done by 7 of 9 councilmembers,\" Sawant said. She then named names. \"Councilmember Herbold you were part of that; Council President Gonzalez you were part of that.\"\n\nSawant continued: \"While I welcome your positive words now I think it's very clear why the Amazon Tax should be heard in my committee. You all have a historic opportunity to show that the council is not divided.\"\n\nIn addition to those arguments, tax-averse Councilmember Alex Pedersen wanted to point out that just because he was voting for the legislation to be heard in the budget committee doesn't mean he supports the idea. He expects the legislation to bring up lots of \"hearty questions,\" he said.\n\nSo, a business tax will make its way in front of the Select Budget Committee sometime in the future. The earliest it can be heard will be next week since, due to COVID-19, regular council committee meetings have been suspended. Special committee meetings can be called, but the council is trying to only do those on Wednesdays.","64":"A Poem for Sunday we were waiting in the spring\n\nfor our bodies to return\n\nwaiting in the fall\n\nand waiting in the winter\n\nfor the dead to see our shadows\n\nthe forsythia exploded\n\nwas it dew or was it weeping\n\nthere was hell smeared on our faces\n\nin the morning\n\nas we mixed the silt with blood\n\nyou could wash it off with anger\n\nit was there again that evening\n\nwe collided with the future\n\nwas it spring or all desertion\n\nthe risk, the total starlessness\n\nthe branches and the broken thorns\n\nthe dead arrived to ask us\n\nand I went outside without you\n\nwhen the winter came I lost you\n\nwhen the spring came\n\nthrough the hurrying doves\n\nwas this our punishment\n\ncome here and look\n\nthe clematis is fragrant\n\nsee it climb the trellis\n\nwhere the soul was\n\nindivisible\n\nthe surface of the river\n\nfills with light, the spring\n\nalready fading\n\nare they questions\n\nare they prayers\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

Rabs undergo conformational switching, being more active with bound GTP and less active with bound GDP. Rab-binding proteins, termed effectors, bind with higher affinity to Rab:GTP than to Rab:GDP. We now report that the prenylated yeast vacuolar Rab Ypt7 undergoes GTP\/GDP switching, which is recognized by its effector HOPS (homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting). In contrast, transmembrane-anchored Ypt7 undergoes GTP\/GDP switching, but binds and activates HOPS with either bound guanine nucleotide. A function of the Rab prenyl anchor is revealed, allowing an effector to read guanine-nucleotide-regulated Rab conformation.\n\nMembrane fusion is catalyzed by conserved proteins R, Qa, Qb, and Qc SNAREs, which form tetrameric RQaQbQc complexes between membranes; SNARE chaperones of the SM, Sec17\/\u03b1SNAP, and Sec18\/NSF families; Rab-GTPases (Rabs); and Rab effectors. Rabs are anchored to membranes by C-terminal prenyl groups, but can also function when anchored by an apolar polypeptide. Rabs are regulated by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), activating the hydrolysis of bound GTP. We have reconstituted fusion with pure components from yeast vacuoles including SNAREs, the HOPS (homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting) tethering and SNARE-assembly complex, and the Rab Ypt7, bound to membranes by either C-terminal prenyl groups (Ypt7-pr) or a recombinant transmembrane anchor (Ypt7-tm). We now report that HOPS-dependent fusion occurs with Ypt7 anchored by either means, but only Ypt7-pr requires GTP for activation and is inactive either with bound GDP or without bound guanine nucleotide. In contrast, Ypt7-tm is constitutively active for HOPS-dependent fusion, independent of bound guanine nucleotide. Fusion inhibition by the GAP Gyp1-46 is not limited to Ypt7-tm with bound GTP, indicating that this GAP has an additional mode of regulating fusion. Phosphorylation of HOPS by the vacuolar kinase Yck3 renders fusion strictly dependent on GTP-activated Ypt7, whether bound to membranes by prenyl or transmembrane anchor. The binding of GTP or GDP constitutes a selective switch for Ypt7, but with Ypt7-tm, this switch is only read by HOPS after phosphorylation to P-HOPS by its physiological kinase Yck3.

Well-designed projects can increase employment opportunities, reduce transport costs, and support regional development. However, roads will also drive deforestation, threatening biodiversity and ecosystem services, jeopardizing the welfare of indigenous people, and moving the biome toward irreversible shifts in vegetation. Data to support good decisions are remarkably scarce. Typical feasibility studies, where they exist, inadequately address environmental and social impacts and do not facilitate comparison across projects. This study contributes to informed decision-making by quantifying the environmental, social and economic effects of 75 planned projects. It demonstrates that fewer projects in carefully chosen locations would dramatically improve outcomes of all types.","68":"A combination of two human monoclonal antibodies limits fetal damage by Zika virus in macaques Contributed by Michel C. Nussenzweig, February 25, 2020 (sent for review January 22, 2020; reviewed by Sonja Best and Guido Silvestri)\n\nZika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy can cause fetal abnormalities. Vaccines against ZIKV are under development, but because of potential safety concerns due to disease-enhancing antibodies, and the time required by active immunization to induce protective antibodies, there is a need to explore alternative strategies. Recombinant monoclonal antibodies can be modified to prevent enhancement of infection, and thus could be an efficacious and safe alternative to vaccines to confer rapid protection. We show that prophylactic administration of two engineered antibodies, Z004 and Z021, to pregnant macaques partially protects against fetal neurologic damage and limits vertical transmission of ZIKV.","69":"A comparison of glacial and paraglacial denudation responses to rapid glacial retreat | Annals of Glaciology | Cambridge Core Glacier thinning and retreat drives initial acceleration of glacier sliding and erosion, de-buttressing of steep valley walls, and destabilization of ice-marginal deposits and bedrock, which can lead to massive rock avalanching and accelerated incision of tributary watersheds. A compelling example of these changes occurred in Taan Fjord in SE Alaska due to the rapid thinning and retreat of Tyndall Glacier over the past half century. Increased glacier sliding speeds led to both increased rates of subglacial erosion and the evacuation of subglacially stored sediments into the proglacial basins. The shrinking glacier also exposed proglacial tributary watersheds to rapid incision and denudation driven by >350 m of baselevel fall in a few decades. Moreover, in October 2015 a large tsunamigenic landslide occurred at the terminus of Tyndall Glacier, largely due to thinning exposing oversteepened, unstable slopes. Sediment yields from the glacier, the landslide and the tributary watersheds, measured from surveys of the sediments in the fjord collected in 1999 and 2016, are compared to ongoing changes in glacier and fjord geometry to investigate the magnitude of glacial and paraglacial denudation in Taan Fjord during retreat. In the last 50 years, sediment yields from the glacier and non-glacial tributaries kept pace with the rapid rate of retreat, and were on par with each other. Notably, basin-averaged erosion rates from the paraglacial landscape were twice that from the glacier, averaging 58 \u00b1 9 and 26 \u00b1 5 mm a-1, respectively. The sharp increases in sediment yields during retreat observed from both the glacier and the adjacent watersheds, including the landslide, highlight the rapid evolution of landscapes undergoing glacier shrinkage.","70":"A first look at Microsoft's xCloud game streaming service for Windows PCs Microsoft has started testing its Project xCloud game streaming service for Windows 10 PCs this week. The software giant is making the preview version, which lets you stream Xbox games to a PC, available to all Microsoft employees. The Verge has been able to obtain exclusive screenshots of how xCloud will work on PCs.\n\nMicrosoft has developed an Xbox Game Streaming app for Windows 10 that will be available in the Windows Store. Much like the Android or iOS versions, the app requires a Bluetooth Xbox One controller, a Microsoft account, and a good internet connection. The PC app will also support streaming games from an Xbox One console locally or remotely, instead of using Microsoft's xCloud server blades.\n\nThere are a variety of games available to Microsoft employees to test, but the app is currently limited to 720p streams for now. \"This internal preview is running at 720p resolution with 1080p just around the corner,\" reveals an internal Microsoft support note.\n\nThe experience is very similar to what is available on Android and iOS, even down to the user interface and the way you access and stream games. It certainly looks ready to be tested broadly, and it's likely that Microsoft will roll this out to external Xbox testers soon.\n\nMicrosoft also recently upgraded its xCloud server blades to include eight Xbox One S consoles in a single server instance. That's up from the four the company was previously testing.\n\nMicrosoft is now working to eventually transition these xCloud servers to the Xbox Series X processor. This next-gen processor is far more powerful and capable of running four Xbox One S game sessions simultaneously on a single chip. It also includes a new built-in video encoder that is up to six times faster than the current external encoder that Microsoft uses on existing xCloud servers.\n\nMicrosoft has committed to launching xCloud this year, with PS4 controller support and this Windows 10 streaming on the way. The Xbox maker is planning to integrate Project xCloud with Xbox Game Pass later this year, allowing players to stream games from the company's subscription service directly from the cloud.","71":"A great virus fighter for Minnesotans? Spending time outdoors For mind and body, add time in Minnesota's outdoors to your virus prevention kit\n\nIn the middle of last week, I took a long-planned camping trip with three of my college kids. We settled in at a small but comfortable cabin, Big Bluestem, in Afton State Park.\n\nThe skies were leaden with clouds and the breeze was cold when we arrived in midday. We quickly dumped the gear, pulled up buffs, and hiked off to the nearest trail to get close to the St. Croix River. As we walked, birds pierced the quiet with song, or darted past. Wind rustled the oak holdovers. Our icy ski trail was giving way to spring's thaw -- and the crunch of our boots. We dropped down and down some more through the river bluffland.\n\nI'm sure our blood pressure dropped, too. There wasn't a COVID-19 tweet in sight.\n\nYou've been told to wash hands and keep social distance. This is also vital to your well-being and to help flatten the curve: Spend time outdoors.\n\nDoing so might be as important as anything for your mind and body -- and ultimately the people you love -- in our tumultuous days.\n\nScare or no scare, Jean Larson thinks a lot about the healing power of time outdoors for people's health. She runs nature therapy programs at the Landscape Arboretum in Chaska and is an assistant professor at the Center for Spirituality and Healing at the University of Minnesota.\n\nLarson, too, has been outdoors at her farm in Princeton, Minn., and elsewhere contemplating our trying times and the peace that can be but a step away.\n\n\"When you can be out in nature, when you can connect with that biophilia part of yourself, your mind and spirit can relax, and you can reconnect to the higher executive function. And that is just how our brain works.\"\n\nLarson says the best way to understand biophilia, an environmental psychology term, is to understand its opposite: biophobia. We are hard-wired to react to things we connect with fear. Our brains, she said, go into survival mode, and that hijacks our thought process. What's also innate is how we connect nature with peace and calm. That's biophilia at work.\n\n\"That's a calling kind of a thing for us,\" Larson says. \"It's unconscious. It's part of our DNA. It's part of who we are, and when we're presented opportunities to be in nature that can activate that in us, our bodies can start to relax and find a sense of calm.\"\n\nThat sort-of flow state can center us. We find a higher level of consciousness -- and an ability to process the good and the bad, to find our balance.\n\n\"If we're out on a walk in nature, if we're being present in this moment, feeling the air,\" says Larson, \"it does bring a momentary calmness to you, and that is restorative.\n\n\"We live in this world of a thousand paper cuts. It's just an accumulation of stress. So, these moments where we can turn that off, and let our brains and bodies and spirits reboot, reinvigorates us and brings us that ability to go back into it.\"\n\nLarson gave a little shoutout to health care providers carrying so much weight in the crisis. She hopes they find some refuge in the healing gardens and therapeutic landscapes that have become commonplace at facilities for patients and staff.\n\nThere is a hope in nature, Larson says, seeing that the natural world carries on regardless of our human demands and frailties.\n\n\"There is a constant. We have air to breathe -- that's a constant. Why do we have air to breathe? Because we have trees around us.\"\n\nElementary? Maybe. But Larson says we as a species have worked so hard to protect against weather and calamity and discomfort -- to survive -- that we're disconnected. \"We are not in touch with the biophilia parts of minds anymore.\"\n\nYet, look around. The opportunities are ever-present. And as Minnesotans, don't we have an even greater appreciation of natural spaces?\n\nThe ridges and ravines and prairie of Afton State Park were that opportunity for my kids and me. We grounded ourselves in what was real in that moment -- our interconnectedness in scary times and our bond with the outdoors. We could for a time wrap our brains around all of it.\n\nThe research and literature are abundant about nature's abiding therapy. At Afton, we were living proof. We found freedom in the birds and the rustling leaves and the river's thaw. All changing and, thankfully, unchanging.","72":"A hepatocyte differentiation model reveals two subtypes of liver cancer with different oncofetal properties and therapeutic targets This article requires a subscription to view the full text. If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nDevelopmental signaling pathways play important roles in cancer initiation and therapeutic resistance. Poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) usually show phenotypic resemblance to their ancestral precursor cells and are associated with poor clinical outcome. In a recent study, a dynamic oncofetal-like gene expression signature during liver development was identified from an in vitro hepatocyte differentiation model. Two subtypes of liver cancer with different oncofetal properties and upstream oncogenic drivers were found in clinical patients with poor prognosis. Clinically available small-molecule inhibitors HLM6474 and SIS3 specifically targeting the oncofetal drivers extensively down-regulated subtype-specific developmental signaling and significantly inhibited tumorigenicity. Further treatment of HCC patients with specified small-molecular inhibitors according to subtype-specific biomarkers might accurately block the tumor-initiating steps and eliminate tumor progression.","73":"A key mammalian cholesterol synthesis enzyme, squalene monooxygenase, is allosterically stabilized by its substrate Edited by Brenda A. Schulman, Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany, and approved February 18, 2020 (received for review September 20, 2019)\n\nCholesterol is an essential component of cell membranes and a precursor for steroid hormones and bile acids. Squalene monooxygenase (SM) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and has been demonstrated to be posttranslationally regulated via a negative feedback mechanism that involves cholesterol-mediated degradation. Here, we revealed another regulatory mechanism for this enzyme through a chemical genetics screen. SM is stabilized by its substrate, squalene, via direct binding of squalene to its noncatalytic, N-terminal regulatory domain. Our findings suggest that squalene is not just an inert hydrocarbon in cholesterol synthesis but a more active feedforward regulator of the pathway and offers a renewed opportunity to modulate SM activity via allosteric modulation of its stability.","74":"A little history goes a long way toward understanding why we study consciousness the way we do today Edited by Leslie G. Ungerleider, National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, MD, and approved February 12, 2020 (received for review December 17, 2019)\n\nConsciousness is currently a thriving area of research in psychology and neuroscience. While this is often attributed to events that took place in the early 1990s, consciousness studies today are a continuation of research that started in the late 19th century and that continued throughout the 20th century. From the beginning, the effort built on studies of animals to reveal basic principles of brain organization and function, and of human patients to gain clues about consciousness itself. Particularly important and our focus here is research in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s involving three groups of patients -- amnesia, split brain, and blindsight. Across all three groups, a similar pattern of results was found -- the patients could respond appropriately to stimuli that they denied seeing (or in the case of amnesiacs, having seen before). These studies paved the way for the current wave of research on consciousness. The field is, in fact, still grappling with the implications of the findings showing that the ability to consciously know and report the identity of a visual stimulus can be dissociated in the brain from the mechanisms that underlie the ability to behave in a meaningful way to the same stimulus.","75":"A lonely bear kept in a cage since birth is finally free A bear which spent its entire life captive in a a case has been rescued by campaigners.\n\nSun bear Annemarie was kept in dungeon-like conditions in a windowless room in a small village in Nam Dinh province, north eastern Vietnam.\n\nBut following the death of of the seven-year-old animal's owner, NGO Animals Asia were able to carry out a rescue. According to the charity, the owner's son was \"keen to do the right thing and voluntarily hand over the bear\" after he discovered the animals legally had to be registered.\n\nA team of volunteers visited the property Annemarie was being held at a nd used bolt cutters before removing her on to a make-shift stretcher and taking her to the Animals Asia sanctuary, north of Hanoi.\n\nBear manager Louise Ellis said: \"After arriving, Annemarie was still very frightened and wary of people around her.\n\n\"Eventually she began to relax a little and was given a cooling shower with the hose pipe to help revive her after the journey. She soon began to enjoy the spray, pawing at the water and sitting up so her belly could get wet.\n\n\"She appears to like watermelon and kept going back to the food bowl to take a piece. She was left to settle overnight. She is still very scared but hopefully with time and TLC she will begin to relax a bit more and settle into her new life here.\"\n\nTuan Bendixsen, Animals Asia's Vietnam Director, said: \"At seven years old this is still a young bear and one that can enjoy a full life in the future. However, there is always a physical price to pay for these bears when they have suffered a lack of space, poor diet and inexpert care.\"\n\nAnnemarie will now be kept in quarantine for 45 days, during which time she will undergo any necessary medical procedures. Ultrasound scans revealed Annemarie suffered from some joint damage - as might be expected from her former living conditions - but it is not believed bile was extracted from her.\n\nIn some south east Asia countries, and particularly in China, bears are often farmed for their bile, which is used as a traditional medicine. It is used to 'treat' sore throats, sores, haemorrhoids, sprains, bruising, muscle ailments, epilepsy and to 'clear' the liver, according to a report by Traffic, a wildlife trade monitoring network.\n\nAnimals Asia said of the practice: \"The bile, which is stored in the gall bladder, is collected by means of various extraction methods, all of which cause massive infections in the bears.\n\n\"Most farmed bears are starved, dehydrated and suffering from multiple diseases and malignant tumours that not only contaminate their bile but ultimately kill them. Very few receive appropriate medication or any type of veterinary care.\n\n\"Animals Asia has also seen instances of old or very sick bears - those who fail to produce bile - simply left to starve to death in their cages.\n\n\"Pathology reports have shown that bile from sick bears is often contaminated with, blood, pus, faeces, urine, bacteria and cancer cells.\"","76":"A look at the 2019 osprey nesting season This is a summary of 2019 osprey research and production assembled and written by Vanessa Greene, an osprey researcher who lives in Hennepin County. It has been edited. This is the 36th year of monitoring the osprey population in the eight-county Twin Cities Metro area. Funding for this project comes via donations.\n\nThe first Ospreys of the 2019 season were observed April 6. Reports came from various parts of the metro area. The first signs of incubation were documented April 19.\n\nLast year was a struggle for many ospreys, with a higher failure rate than past years. Although there were 151 occupied nests, eggs were laid in only 140. There were 136 occupied nests in 2018, eggs laid in 125.\n\nAt least one chick was confirmed to have fledged successfully or survived to fledging age in 93 of these nests, down from 96 in 2018.\n\nThe failure rate was 39 percent, a significant increase. In 2018 it was 29 percent, in 2017 28 percent, and in 2016 25 percent.\n\nIt was notable that a very large cluster of 20 nest failures occurred in an approximate 10-mile square area surrounding Carver Park and the University of Minnesota Landscape Arboretum, near Victoria, Chanhassen, Chaska and Mound, MN. Most other failures occurred on scattered nests in the metro area.\n\nWe do not know the reasons for these failures, but in some cases we suspect a large black fly hatch, after heavy rains, may have affected outcomes. Some adults were observed flying off the nest repeatedly during incubation. Swarms of black flies were seen on some nests with newly hatched chicks which probably succumbed to the constant biting.\n\nThe number of chicks known to have fledged successfully or survived to fledging age was 194, close to the 205 fledged in 2018. There were 41 nests with two chicks, 30 nests with three chicks, and 22 nests that produced a single chick.\n\nMortality rate this year was similar to last year with 17 chicks known to have died or disappeared before fledging, down from 19 last year. Three chicks died post-fledge. Two adults also died, one from a vehicle collision, the other from a possible impact injury after a territorial dispute. It was found dead near another nest on a cell tower with a severely broken wing.\n\nWe located 13 new nesting territories. Only four of these new nests successfully fledged chicks. One nest which was occupied by geese for the second year. Of the 151 occupied territories this year, 78 were on osprey nesting platforms, 29 were on cell or radio towers, 22 were on ballfield lights, 18 were on a power pole or transmission tower, two were on other manmade structures and two nests were built in a dead tree.\n\nOne of the tree nests produced two chicks which survived to an advanced age, but the nest blew down in a storm and both chicks died.\n\nProductivity of occupied nests successful this year dropped significantly to 62 percent. Previous marks, dating back to 2012, ranged from a high of 77 percent (2012) to a low of 67 percent (2013).\n\nSix male birds monitored this year were 15 or 16 years old. Only two bred successfully. Our oldest female was a banded bird that showed up on a nest this year for the first time, and she was 13 years old, and she bred successfully! We believe she must have been nesting previously in a territory that we don't know about. There were four 12-year-old females, three of which bred successfully.","77":"A pair of esterases from a commensal gut bacterium remove acetylations from all positions on complex \u03b2-mannans This article requires a subscription to view the full text. If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nAcetylation is an important feature of hemicellulose, altering the physical properties of the plant cell wall and limiting enzyme accessibility. Removal of acetyl groups from \u03b2-mannan is a key step toward efficient utilization of this glycan as a carbon source for gut microbiota and in biorefineries. We present detailed insight into mannan deacetylation by two highly substrate-specific acetyl-mannan esterases (AcMEs) from a prevalent gut commensal Firmicute, which cooperatively deacetylate complex galactoglucomannan. The three-dimensional structure of RiCE17 with mannopentaose in the active site has a unique two-domain architecture including a CBM35 and a SGNH superfamily hydrolytic domain. Discovery of \u03b2-mannan-specific esterases improves the understanding of an important step in dietary fiber utilization by gut commensal Firmicutes.","78":"A paradigm of thermal adaptation in penguins and elephants by tuning cold activation in TRPM8 Edited by David E. Clapham, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Ashburn, VA, and approved March 3, 2020 (received for review December 26, 2019)\n\nSensing temperature is critical for the survival of all living beings. Here, we show that during cold-induced activation of the archetypical temperature-sensitive TRPM8 ion channel, there are hydrophobic residues in the pore domain stabilized in the exposed state. Tuning hydrophobicity of these residues specifically alters cold response in TRPM8. Furthermore, TRPM8 orthologs in vertebrates evolved to employ such a mechanism, which physiologically tunes cold tolerance for better thermal adaptation. Our findings not only advance the understanding of the cold-induced activation mechanism of TRPM8 but also bring insights to the molecular evolution strategy for ambient-temperature adaptation in vertebrates.","79":"A pheromone antagonist liberates female sea lamprey from a sensory trap to enable reliable communication In many animals, males deceive females into mating using traits that mimic cues of food, predators, preferred habitats, or offspring in need of care. However, if and how these deceptive signals guide reliable communication without females confusing the mimic and the model remain unclear. We discovered that female sea lamprey discriminate a nonsexual cue of productive habitat from the deceptive male sex pheromone that mimics it and identify a pheromone antagonist as the underlying mechanism. Our results implicate a means by which females can detect and benefit from male deceit and could have applications for control of destructive populations of sea lamprey in the Laurentian Great Lakes.\n\nThe evolution of male signals and female preferences remains a central question in the study of animal communication. The sensory trap model suggests males evolve signals that mimic cues used in nonsexual contexts and thus manipulate female behavior to generate mating opportunities. Much evidence supports the sensory trap model, but how females glean reliable information from both mimetic signals and their model cues remains unknown. We discovered a mechanism whereby a manipulative male signal guides reliable communication in sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus). Migratory sea lamprey follow a larval cue into spawning streams; once sexually mature, males release a pheromone that mimics the larval cue and attracts females. Females conceivably benefit from the mimetic pheromone during mate search but must discriminate against the model cue to avoid orienting toward larvae in nearby nursery habitats. We tested the hypothesis that spawning females respond to petromyzonol sulfate (PZS) as a behavioral antagonist to avoid attraction to the larval cue while tracking the male pheromone despite each containing attractive 3-keto petromyzonol sulfate (3kPZS). We found 1) PZS inhibited electrophysiological responses to 3kPZS and abated preferences for 3kPZS when mixed at the same or greater concentrations, 2) larvae released more PZS than 3kPZS whereas males released more 3kPZS than PZS, and 3) mixtures of 3kPZS and PZS applied at ratios measured in larval and male odorants resulted in the discrimination observed between the natural odors. Our study elucidates how communication systems that arise via deception can facilitate reliable communication.","80":"A regional nuclear conflict would compromise global food security Edited by Christopher B. Field, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, and approved February 11, 2020 (received for review October 30, 2019)\n\nImpacts of global warming on agricultural productivity have been evaluated extensively. The implications of sudden cooling for global crop growth, however, are as yet little understood. While crop failures after historic volcanic eruptions are documented, a nuclear conflict can cause even more severe and longer-lasting climate anomalies. India and Pakistan are contributing to a de facto Asian arms race and the political instability in South Asia increasingly imposes a global threat. Based on comprehensive climate and crop model ensemble simulations, we provide critical quantitative information on how sudden cooling and perturbations of precipitation and solar radiation could disrupt food production and trade worldwide for about a decade -- more than the impact from anthropogenic climate change by late century.","81":"A reminder for Twins fans, courtesy of the Brewers This isn't about how the Brewers, who have the second-worst record in baseball, managed to win four of their six games with the Twins this season. And this isn't meant to be gloom-and-doom either.\n\nA year ago right year, the Brewers were 18 games over .500, led their division by 6 1\/2 games and all was great. Then everything fell apart to such an extent that Milwaukee barely finished over .500 and has continued that plummet in 2015.\n\nRight now, in the big picture, I think most people are feeling good about the Twins being five games over .500 -- even if their play has been inconsistent for a few weeks. Also, after the current series in Cincinnati, the Twins will be playing division leaders (Kansas City and Baltimore) and nemesis Detroit to bring them to the All-Star break.\n\nThe wheels haven't come off, but there are issues out there:\n\nThe bullpen is getting messier: Right-hander Blaine Boyer can't get right-handed batters out (.310 batting average against and .536 slugging percentage) vs. .160 and .220 against batters from the left. Aaron Thompson hasn't been able to get anyone out in June.(OK, I'm exaggerating. He's faced 30 batters this month and gotten 17 of them out.) Even if you pretend Casey Fien didn't give up two home runs to four batters in Sunday's loss, there's isn't any reliability beyond Fien and the All-Star closer Glen Perkins, whom we've seen only three times in the last two weeks. The Twins bullpen has slipped into the bottom third of the American League by most measurements. Fans can hope Alex Meyer's debut was an aberration and that management is keeping an eye out for upgrades.\n\nThe outfield is again unsettled, but...: Don't expected to see Byron Buxton before August, when his learning curve will again commence. If Eddie Rosario becomes the main center fielder, the early-season issue of defensive weakness in left and right will resurface. If Danny Santana gets a chance in center, then shortstop will be shared by the Eduardos and their limited range. The return of a healthy Aaron Hicks is probably the best-case scenario for the short term. In case you're wondering about the exile of Oswaldo Arcia, I'm assuming it can be explained by a slash line of .202\/.235\/.287 at Rochester, including one home run and 27 strikeouts in 94 at-bats.\n\nAnd at shortstop: La Velle E. Neal III brought up the issue with Terry Ryan, who thinks the Twins have depth at the position.All of the options have flaws. I'd like to think the Twins can roll with Santana for a while with the Eduardos in reserve roles. When needed, i think I'm more comfortable for now with Santana at short and an Eduardo in left until the return of Hicks (and then Buxton).\n\nJoe Mauer: There are enough other problems right now that Mauer's season has slipped out of the bullseye. For the record, he's last among the 12 qualifying first basemen in the American League in slugging percentage and 11th in OPS. He has four home runs; Chris Parmelee has four home runs for Baltimore. Mauer has 273 at-bats, Parmelee has 43. In other words, by any standard, Mauer is still being miscast as the No. 3 batter in the Twins' lineup. Almost as big an issue is the lack of options that manager Paul Molitor has for that spot.\n\nThe starting rotation: Ervin Santana is scheduled to join the Twins in Kansas City next weekend after his drug suspension. That will give the Twins six healthy starters who deserve to be in the rotation -- an unanticipated surplus. There are a lot of options and I don't have a favorite. If the Twins stay with a five-man rotation, someone will get an unfair break. Given the other issues that need more immediate tending (and the history of starting pitching in recent years), however, I'm not seeing that as a problem. The bullpen does need help.\n\nRight now, I'm still thinking of the glass as more than half full, given what we were expecting at the start of the year. And I think the Twins should still frame their decisions with the idea that they are a postseason contender. But the buyer\/seller and now\/future debates will be moving targets throughout July, so it'll be fair for all of us to change our minds of that one.\n\nSome things need to get better for the Twins to be taken as seriously as we wanted to take them at the end of last month. Or as seriously as Brewers fans were taking their team at this time last year.","82":"A short-and-sour thought about the Twins I'm going to keep this short: That the Twins didn't do much of anything to help themselves at trading deadline wasn't as alarming as the team's inability to address its lack of bullpen depth in the weeks leading up to it. I could live without a new shortstop, as unfortunately unsettled as that situation has become, or added catching depth.\n\nBut consistently winning baseball demands a better bullpen than the Twins know they have.\n\nChasing a one-game wild card berth is not worth the bigger moves that you'd want a team to make if it's contending for a division title and an immediate jump to best-of-seven postseason play. Rental-for-prospect is a shaky calculus in that situation. But the Twins gave the impression they were operating under the assumption that the roster, as constructed in June and July, was good enough for August and September.\n\nBy most any measure, Twins relief pitchers rank among the bottom batch in the American League, and it is a situation that has been getting worse. Glen Perkins giving up four home runs to the last 20 batters he's faced is the ugliest mark. But Blaine Boyer is a right-hander who can't retire right-handed batters, who have a .361 on-base percentage against him, and lefty Brian Duensing gives up almost a hit per inning and walks a batter every other inning on average. (And lefties have a .449 OBP against him.)\n\nI'll spare you more bullpen data, other than to say there's no way you can make a case that the Twins were approaching a tough August schedule with an sufficient group of relievers. The Kevin Jepsen deal on its own wasn't enough of a bump. Solid pitching, from top to bottom, can get a team through the inevitable times when the offense slumps. The bottom has been bottoming out.\n\nRight now, the standings have the Twins in a three-way tie with Toronto and Baltimore for the second Wild Card spot. The latest postseason projections from Fangraphs have the Twins with an 11 percent shot at the Wild Card, compared with 22 percent for Baltimore and 43 percent for Toronto.\n\nSo if you're being an optimist, get good odds.\n\nThis is not a case of bomb-throwing at the Twins' baseball decision-makers. Some good calls have been made. The sequence in which the minor-leaguers were promoted defied conventional wisdom but worked pretty well. Eddie Rosario, Aaron Hicks and Miguel Sano were handled properly, and the Byron Buxton promotion was sidetracked by an injury, although I suspect he would have ended up back in Rochester rather than staying with the Twins. Trevor May has helped the bullpen. Paul Molitor has pushed more good managing buttons than bad ones.\n\nThe Twins have given us more meaningful games that we expected when the season started.

The uppermost sediment units show an abrupt transition from ice-proximal debris to a draped silt during the late Holocene, which is interpreted to coincide with rapid deglaciation. The small scale and fine sorting of the upper unit could be attributed to origins in subglacial meltwater; however the thickness and deposition rate for this unit imply punctuated- rather than continuous-deposition. This, combined with the deposit's location seaward of large, bedrock basins, has led to the interpretation of this unit as the result of subglacial lake outbursts in these basins. However, the fine-scale sorting of the silt unit is problematic for this energetic interpretation, which should mobilize and deposit a wider range of sediment sizes. To resolve this discrepancy, we present an alternative mechanism in which the silt was sorted by a distributed subglacial water system, stored in bedrock basins far inland of the grounding line, and subsequently eroded at higher flow speeds during retreat. We demonstrate that this mechanism is physically plausible given the subglacial conditions during the late Holocene. We hypothesize that similar silt units observed elsewhere in Antarctica downstream of bedrock basins could be the result of the same mechanism.","84":"AB De Villier's Return Might \"Upset A Few Players\" In Contention For T20 World Cup Squad, Says Jonty Rhodes | Cricket News Former South Africa cricketer Jhonty Rhodes has said that while the team should pick AB de Villiers if that increases Proteas' chances of winning the upcoming T20 World Cup, it won't be an easy call to make. AB De Villiers has said that he would be happy to come out of international retirement at the T20 World Cup, which is slated to be held in Australia from October 18 to November 15 this year. South Africa coach Mark Boucher later said that de Villiers should make a decision by the end of the upcoming season of the Indian Premier League (IPL).\n\nRhodes said that while he is excited by the possibility of de Villiers returning, it might leave some of the current players unhappy as it could mean benching a player who is currently a frontrunner to make it to the World T20 squad.\n\n\"I think it's interesting because it's a tough call,\" Rhodes told ESPNcricinfo.\n\n\"You want your best team to play... It's also tough on the guys who then miss out. You know AB is a very special player, so do you set a precedent for a guy like AB de Villiers if he is not playing for South Africa... I mean why are you selecting him?\n\n\"I suppose a lot of people will watch how he performs in the IPL, but just watching him in the Big Bash League, he's such a class player; I'm a big fan of AB de Villiers. But I'm just not sure of the precedent. If you want to win a T20 World Cup, you should do anything to win it. You're not breaking any rules, you are setting a slight precedent and you are going to be upsetting a few players who are going to miss out.\n\n\"It's difficult to say because I'm not somebody who is missing out, I'm also not from the administration to set this kind of a precedent... I don't have to make that call. But it'll be great to see AB de Villiers play at a World Cup again for us,\" Rhodes said.","85":"ABC News Did Not Run a Story About a Fake Photographer, Despite a Video of Meet Matty Mo, 'The Most Famous Artist' you've never heard of I Nightline\n\nOn March 15th, we reposted a YouTube video of a comedian who claimed to have tricked ABC News into running a fake story about him. Well, it appears that the real ones who were duped were this writer and the comedian's fans, because the actual news story wasn't about the comedian at all.\n\nBackground\n\nIn the video in question, Aussie comedian, Lewis Spears, pretends to be a famous fashion photographer and manages to trick ABC's Lana Zak into doing an impromptu photo shoot in front of LA's famous Pink Wall. Spears' video is not what it seems, though, because he claimed that the reporter was there to do a story about him. At the beginning of the video, which can be seen here, Spears says this:\n\nIn this video I will show you how I tricked American news network, Nightline, into doing a fake story on a fake photographer, and broadcasting that fake story nationwide\n\nAs you can probably tell from the video above, Zak's actual story was about Matty Mo, self-described \"Most Famous Artist\", who seems to be more of a marketing whizz than an artist, but who am I to judge? The report is an entertaining and thought-provoking piece, so if you haven't already watched it, please do so -- if not for Zak's reportage, then for Spears' three seconds of fame, which he rather skillfully uses to create a fake story within a fake story.\n\nLana Zak's Response\n\nBecause of the way that Spears presented his story, I actually couldn't find ABC's original video before I posted that first article. It was actually brought to my attention by Zak, herself, in the comments section. She had this to say:\n\nThis is amazing! I am fascinated in how meta-this has gotten. I'm Lana, the reporter in this story. The report that Lewis Spears is celebrating as his \"hoax\" actually begins with a quote from the true subject of my report with these words, \"That's a key takeaway, that the internet is not real, surprise!\" Here's what is true: Spears did indeed appear on camera for 3 seconds by saying he flew nearly 24 hours to take photos at this famous Instagram spot. (Which by all counts is true.) We never use any name or describe him as a famous photographer, in all honestly he was just one of hundreds of people taking photos there. He claims he \"tricked\" us into running a fake story about him, but the story is never about him and misses the point of my report about our Selfie-obsessed society in which I explore the idea that people can become what they say they are just by saying it.\n\nBut here's where Spears seems to go from a satirist to a bully, if he did in fact watch my piece and understand it, he appears to be lying to his viewers about what we reported. Our story, which we worked on for months before Spears bumped into us is a critical look at Instagram-obsession and a profile of an actual performance artist called, \"Matty Mo: the most famous artist.\" I stand by my reporting and my hard working team. You can watch our actual Nightline piece here and make up your own mind. And Lewis, if you didn't actually watch our full piece, and someone just told you about it check it out. I like to hope you'd correct yourself rather than be the kind of guy who would falsely brag to his buddies about how far he got with a girl, regardless of a thought to her reputation, just because he thinks it makes him seem cooler, or funnier.\n\nLewis Spears' Response\n\nI reached out to Spears, asking for a comment. I pointed out the fact that his statement from the video -- quoted above -- isn't accurate and that he edited the video in such a way as to make it look like the report was about him and not Matt Mo. This was his reply, verbatim:\n\nIt's good to see ABC Nightline doing some research on a story for a change, even if it is after publishing that story. I would like to correct the record and say that while Lana: Did do a full interview with a fake character without confirming their identity, Did pose for photoshoot taken on a 200 dollar Canon Powershot thinking it would be in Vogue Australia, Did take a bite out of an onion she was handed from a strangers pocket, And, Did not do even the bare minimum amount of research (like Googling the name Clive Palmer and finding out he is actually a very fat politician and not me.) At least only a few seconds of that made it to television. Which makes all of the above MUCH less embarrassing... Right?\n\nI pressed him -- asking again why he presented the video in the way that he did, but he has not responded.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThis whole situation has certainly given me food for thought as it appears as though I have made myself part of the \"fake news\" cycle.\n\nWhat do our readers think? Was Spears conducting some sort of meta-commentary about why we shouldn't believe everything we see on the internet, or was he playing fast loose with the facts by pandering to a specific audience with the hope of gaining more attention? We would love to hear from you in the comments below.","86":"AEW Superstar praises Edge and Randy Orton for their epic match at WWE WrestleMania 36 Edge walked away with a vital win over his former tag team partner at The Grandest Stage of Them All.\n\nDuring his time in WWE, Chris Jericho shared the ring with both Edge and Randy Orton and at this year's WrestleMania 36, the former Rated RKO pairing went toe-to-toe in a Last Man Standing Match.\n\nWith Edge securing a huge win over a 30-minute thriller against Orton, The Rated R-Superstar marked his return to singles competition in the best way possible. In response to the match, All Elite Wrestling's Chris Jericho took to Twitter and had huge praise for both men.\n\nOn night 2 of WrestleMania 36, Edge and Randy Orton squared-off in a grueling Last Man Standing Match which saw the two men brawl all over the WWE Performance Center and even at the backstage area of it.\n\nEdge, who made his return to WWE at this year's Royal Rumble, was involved in his first singles match in nine years, as he and The Viper took each other to the limit and gave us an emotional Last Man Standing bout.\n\nIt sure did take some resilience from The Rated-R Superstar to secure a win over Orton and another one of Edge's former tag team partner in the form of Chris Jericho took to Twitter and claimed that he enjoyed the epic performances from both Edge and Randy Orton on the second night of WrestleMania 36.\n\nHere is what Jericho tweeted out:\n\nWith Edge picking up a vital win at WrestleMania, it now remains to be seen what the former WWE Champion will have in mind and has to say on tonight's edition of Monday Night RAW. Considering how vital Edge's win over Orton was, we surely could expect WWE to put 'The Rated R-Superstar' in another significant feud against someone from the stacked RAW roster.\n\nDespite being signed with AEW, it is pretty clear that Chris Jericho is still one of the realest Pro Wrestlers in the business today and always gives credit where its due.\n\nThe former AEW World Champion, who recently lost his title to Jon Moxley at Revolution, is currently in a feud against the recently debuting Matt Hardy on AEW after 'The Broken One' decided to side with The Elite in their on-going war against The Inner Circle.\n\nAs far as this week's AEW Dynamite is concerned, Jericho will be on commentary along with Tony Schiavone and we could expect the former AEW World Champion to bring a lot to the table.","87":"AGAR: Governments, agencies, need to better communicate Sometimes little things show the cracks that might expose big things.\n\nIt seems a little thing, but at our house we received three almost identical bulk mail pieces meant to help us stay safe from COVID-19.\n\nBad decisions are often made in the service of solving a problem when someone says, \"We have to do something.\"\n\nThe idea seems to be that doing anything, even if it is counter-productive, is better than doing nothing.\n\nIn a situation such as we are in now, there seems to be no barrier to the amount of money government is willing to spend, but just because it is being spent doesn't mean that every expense is useful or even needed.\n\nOn the same day last week we received two slick mail pieces regarding the virus.\n\nBoth of them, well produced, on expensive paper, told us to wash our hands, limit exposure to groups, sneeze into our sleeve, not to touch our face and shop during off hours.\n\nThe thing is, both pieces gave the exact same advice. One was from the Canadian government and the other was from the Canadian Medical Association.\n\nTwo days later we received the third; a four page piece from our MPP, Progressive Conservative Kinga Surma.\n\nSame advice. Same nice paper.\n\nTwo of those pieces were a waste. The refrigerator door takes one.\n\nI am not saying any specific mailer was useless; they are too similar to choose. I am saying that there was no coordination between the groups.\n\nThey all just went full steam ahead \"doing something.\"\n\nAll three apparently felt that telling us in print the simple points we have been hearing for weeks now was a necessary expenditure of time and money; that it would help.\n\nIn this case even adding it all together, those mailing pieces will not be the biggest expense during this crisis.\n\nBut together they exemplify the propensity of people to spend, spend, spend without stopping for a moment to ask, \"Is this needed?\"\n\nIf someone else is already doing it, it is not needed.\n\nI'm sure they all have the best intentions but it doesn't seem that the federal government, the provincial government and the Medical Association are talking to one another.\n\nThe larger issue - the real point - is that I wonder how much of this is going on as we try to solve the bigger problems like gathering protective equipment and making wise decisions.\n\nI am against centralizing government power, even in these times, but centralizing and sharing information seems like a good idea. I think it is worrisome that the provinces all have a different way of handling testing and managing of this crisis.\n\nSome provinces are releasing all the information and modelling they have, while some are not. Some experts say wearing a mask will protect you, some say it won't.\n\nAll of them say they are enacting policy based on the best medical advice.\n\nBut they don't seem to be listening to the same medical advice, or instituting the same policies, so whose advice is best?\n\nThat's fine if it turns out the province you live in gets it right.\n\nInformation sharing is easier today than it has ever been in human history. I wish I were more confident that sharing was happening today.\n\nInspiring confidence is an important part of leadership.","88":"AT&T, Telcel y Movistar regalan minutos a sus clientes por contingencia En un acto de sumarse a todas las empresas que buscan entregar ayudas a los consumidor en medio de la crisis, las principales operadoras telef\u00f3nicas en el pa\u00eds han decidi\u00f3 ofrecer tiempo en llamadas y env\u00edos de mensajes gratis a sus usuarios.

Javier Hernandez (10th) and Edu Garcia (48th) put ATK in the driving seat but Nerijus Valskis (69th) reduced their advantage to set up a tense end to the contest. Hernandez scored another in injury time (90+4th) to confirm a record third title. The final was held without spectators owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe match was off to a blistering start as Andre Schembri made a good run to the byline on the right in the first minute and found Rafael Crivellaro in the centre with a good cross, but the Brazilian mishit his effort.

Javier Hernandez, who was left unmarked, smashed a half-volley into the ground and beat goalkeeper Vishal Kaith to give ATK the lead.\n\nThe contest remained open but Chennaiyin suffered an injury setback midway through the first half. Midfielder Germanpreet Singh had to be replaced and Edwin Vanspaul took his place.\n\nATK went close to doubling their lead in the 23rd minute out of utter chaos inside the box which produced three back-to-back attempts.\n\nKrishna cut in from the right and unleashed a powerful strike which was saved by Kaith. Javier Hernandez then had the ball at his feet twice, but on both occasions, his shot was blocked. Chennaiyin put pressure on the ATK defence and carved out a golden chance from a free-kick after the 30-minute-mark.\n\nSchembri met Crivellaro's delivery into the box but Arindam Bhattacharya pulled off an excellent save to keep ATK's lead intact.\n\nThe scoreline remained 1-0 in favour of ATK at the break, but the Kolkata side had a concern of their own as Krishna had to be replaced by Mandi Sosa due to an injury.\n\nATK scored the all-important second goal and doubled their advantage two minutes into the second half.\n\nWilliams picked up the ball in midfield and fed Edu Garcia into the box. The Spanish midfielder beat Kaith with a neat finish from an acute angle to make it 2-0.\n\nThe Chennaiyin attack struggled to create clear-cut chances and their opponents restricted them to long-range efforts.\n\nLallianzuala Chhangte attempted a piledriver from outside the box before the hour mark but sent the ball wide.\n\nChennaiyin finally found a way past the ATK defence in the 69th minute.\n\nLaldinliana Renthlei played a neat one-two with Anirudh Thapa on the right before sending a cross into the centre of the box.\n\nPritam Kotal's headed clearance fell to Jerry Lalrinzuala who passed the ball to Valskis in the centre.\n\nThe Lithuanian striker found the net with a powerful strike to score his 15th goal of the season and give Chennaiyin a lifeline.\n\nChennaiyin built one attack after another as the game neared full-time but the balls into the box were well dealt by ATK.\n\nATK got their third goal of the night and struck the final blow in the last minute of injury time.\n\nSubstitute Pronay Halder lifted the ball over the Chennaiyin defence into the path of Hernandez who slotted the ball home.","90":"ATP- and voltage-dependent electro-metabolic signaling regulates blood flow in heart The ATP-sensitive K+ channel (KATP) is a metabolite sensor that transduces the myocyte metabolic state into an electrical signal. Our studies show that this electro-metabolic signaling mechanism underlies the regulation of local blood flow in the heart through its actions on the contractile elements of the microvasculature. In addition, the efflux of K+ supports this mechanism by its action on the capillary endothelial inward rectifier K+ (Kir2.1). These findings establish a conceptually new framework for understanding the hugely reliable and incredibly robust local electro-metabolic microvascular regulation of blood flow in the heart.\n\nLocal control of blood flow in the heart is important yet poorly understood. Here we show that ATP-sensitive K channels (K), hugely abundant in cardiac ventricular myocytes, sense the local myocyte metabolic state and communicate a negative feedback signal-correction upstream electrically. This electro-metabolic voltage signal is transmitted instantaneously to cellular elements in the neighboring microvascular network through gap junctions, where it regulates contractile pericytes and smooth muscle cells and thus blood flow. As myocyte ATP is consumed in excess of production, [ATP] decreases to increase the openings of K channels, which biases the electrically active myocytes in the hyperpolarization (negative) direction. This change leads to relative hyperpolarization of the electrically connected cells that include capillary endothelial cells, pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells. Such hyperpolarization decreases pericyte and vascular smooth muscle [Ca] levels, thereby relaxing the contractile cells to increase local blood flow and delivery of nutrients to the local cardiac myocytes and to augment ATP production by their mitochondria. Our findings demonstrate the pivotal roles of local cardiac myocyte metabolism and K channels and the minor role of inward rectifier K (Kir2.1) channels in regulating blood flow in the heart. These findings establish a conceptually new framework for understanding the hugely reliable and incredibly robust local electro-metabolic microvascular regulation of blood flow in heart.","91":"Abby Dowse Pulls Up Swimsuit Bottoms, Exposing Cut Hip Bones In Sultry New Snapshot Blond bombshell Abby Dowse sizzled in a bright white swimsuit for a brand new Instagram update.

The model did not reveal her exact location in the steamy snap, but she did send out some positive vibes to her 2.2 million fans.\n\nDowse appeared front and center, playfully tugging at her bikini bottoms. She posed outside under the sun in the shot, standing on a pavement walkway with wooden beams resting between two white structures behind her. The Australian hottie closed her eyes, looked down to the ground, and posed confidently with her legs spread a few inches apart. Her long, blond locks were worn halfway back in a high bun while the remainder of her curly mane fell down her back and left side.\n\nThe unique swimsuit looked like a bikini but was actually a one-piece, connecting the top to the bottom with a small piece of fabric on her side. Dowse pulled at the waistband of the swimsuit, exposing her cut hip bones for the camera. The top had a small amount of fabric covering her chest, presenting a generous glimpse of her tanned underboob and her trim midsection. Only a tiny white strap on her left shoulder kept the swimsuit from falling off completely.\n\nThe skimpy bottoms did her nothing but favors, making her brown legs look like they were a mile long. Even though she was in swimwear, the Dowse added a pair of basic white sneakers to the look while tagging popular online retailer Oh Polly.

Croce, January 14, 2020 (sent for review November 20, 2019; reviewed by Curt I. Civin and Andrea Ventura)\n\nESCC is a deadly disease with few prevention or treatment options. In a dietary Zn deficiency-promoted rat ESCC model with miR-31-controlled inflammation pathway up-regulation, systemic antimiR-31 reduces miR-31 level and inflammation, suppressing ESCC development. We identified Egln3 as a direct miR-31 target and developed a constitutive miR-31 knockout rat model. Interactions of oncogenic miR-31, EGLN3 down-regulation, and inflammation occur in rat and human ESCC tissue. Since miR-31 genetic knockout prevents Zn deficiency-associated ESCC by eliminating or greatly reducing the entire miR-31-EGLN3\/STK40-NF-\u03baB-controlled inflammatory process, we conclude that miR-31 and downstream signaling proteins should be tested as prognostic and therapeutic targets and inexpensive Zn supplementation should be implemented for ESCC prevention in deficient populations.","93":"Absolute yeast mitochondrial proteome quantification reveals trade-off between biosynthesis and energy generation during diauxic shift Edited by Nikolaus Pfanner, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany, and accepted by Editorial Board Member Jasper Rine February 19, 2020 (received for review October 18, 2019)\n\nThis work offers a unique portrayal of yeast mitochondria through the characterization of its absolute proteome. The study of biophysical changes in the mitochondrial network associated with proteome profiling, throughout yeast growth and the transition from fermentative to respiratory metabolism, lays out the crucial role this organelle has in balancing the overall metabolic status of the cell.

One strategy to address this challenge is to generate valuable coproducts alongside biofuels. Engineering bioenergy crops to generate value-added bioproducts in planta can reduce input requirements relative to microbial chassis and skip costly deconstruction and conversion steps. Although rapid progress has been made in plant metabolic engineering, there has been no systematic analysis devoted to quantifying the impact of such engineered bioenergy crops on biorefinery economics. Here, we provide new insights into how bioproduct accumulation in planta affects biofuel selling prices. We present the range of bioproduct selling prices and accumulation rates needed to compensate for additional extraction steps and reach a target $2.50\/gal minimum biofuel selling price.","96":"Adding Texture to Your Backgrounds in Photoshop Easily | Fstoppers A long time ago, I got to visit a friend down in the south of England. We drank (quite a lot of beer), we ate (lots of chocolate brownies), and we set up to shoot a moody portrait.\n\nI am going to show you how to easily add texture to any background to your images in Photoshop! This a technique that I learned when I first started experimenting in Photoshop, and I have used it since on many images. It's quick, easy, and can give you great results without having to spend time with overcomplicated selections (although you will need to make a quick, rough selection).\n\nThis is a technique that I learned from and that is still used by two Photoshop greats, Glyn Dewis and Calvin Hollywood, and I recommend you go check out their websites, which hold a wealth of Photoshop knowledge, tips, and tutorials. I learned so much from them in the early days, and I think you could too. Anyways, on with the tutorial!\n\nBefore we start, for this technique to work, you need to have shot your image with a gray background. To keep the image interesting, make the lighting interesting. If you light it so it looks flat, it will more than likely lead to a boring image. Be dramatic. Play with light and shadow.\n\nFirst, open up your image in Photoshop.\n\nAs you can see, I shot against a gray background. I used one flashgun with a portable softbox, camera right. I feathered it away from the model, more towards the background. This gives us the nice effect of light and shade on the model. It also makes it look like the light could now be coming from a light source on what will be our wall (once the texture is added).\n\nYour next step is to make a quick and rough selection around the model. For this purpose, I more than likely use the Magic Wand tool. I usually have my tolerance set to around 10-13, as it sets how different in tone and color a pixel can be. So, with our tolerance set to 13, Photoshop will select any pixels that are the same color, and any pixels that are 13 shades darker or 13 shades lighter. You can up the tolerance if you wish, but I find it easier to control at a lower amount. Once you have your model selected, it should look something like this:\n\nNow that you have made your selection, we need to save it for later. So, go up to your top bar in Photoshop and go to \"select\" and choose \"save selection\" from the drop-down menu. Go to the name dialog box and type in whatever you would like to call the selection (in this case, \"Shelly mask\"). Click \"ok\".\n\nOnce the dialog box disappears, your selection is saved, so press CTRL+D to deselect. Next, open up your texture in Photoshop. I chose this concrete wall texture.\n\nBring it into your Layers panel, and make sure it is above the model layer.\n\nNow we need to load the saved selection from earlier. So, go back to your top bar and click \"select.\" Then, click on \"load selection.\" The load selection box will pop up. Go to the channel box and choose your saved selection from the drop-down menu. We saved it as \"Shelly mask.\" Click \"ok.\" Your saved selection will now appear on top of your texture layer.\n\nNext, go down to your adjustment layers and click \"add a new layer mask.\" Your model should appear masked in.\n\nAs you can see, this does not look very good: the mask looks rough, and the texture and the model do not blend seamlessly. Well, this next step is when the magic happens. Change the blend mode of the background texture from normal to soft light.\n\nLook at that: the texture now blends in with the lighting on the gray background. The masking around the model also looks far better (but may still need a quick cleanup). The soft light blend mode darkens or lightens the colors, depending on the blend color. If the blend color (light source) is lighter than 50% gray, the image is lightened as if it were dodged. If the blend color is darker than 50% gray, the image is darkened as if it were burned. In layman's terms, it blends the light and the darks of the texture image onto the gray background, even blending in with the light on the model layer. You can also use the technique with the overlay blend mode, but the results will be more contrasty. Using this technique also blends the hair of your models, although our mask here was a little rough. Zoom into your subject to make sure the mask is looking good and watch for spots which need a little cleaning up, like the hair at the back of the model's head.\n\nAll you need to do is select the brush tool, make sure it is set to white on a very soft setting and a flow of around 15-25%, and slowly brush over the hair. It will paint the texture back in and blend perfectly with the hair.\n\nAnd that is it: quick and easy textured backgrounds! All the effects you see in the final image, the textures, blood, and writing were all added using the same technique and using the same saved selection and layer mask to mask it off the model.\n\nOnce you get the hang of this easy technique, play around with it and see what you can create. It opens up many more possibilities. I also use it in model portfolio shoots if I feel the image background needs a little character added to it.\n\nAbove is a selection of other images I have used the same technique on. Using this technique gives you far more options for the final image. You can use pretty much any texture although some work better than others. Stone, concrete, and wood blend well. You can even blend decay textures on top of them to distress the texture you already have.","97":"Adele fans show that her music reaches all ages Request to Vatican to investigate Archbishop Nienstedt in limbo Adele kicked off the first of her two-night Adele Live 2016 North American tour stop at Xcel Energy Center on Tuesday night.","98":"Adversarial alignment enables competing models to engage in cooperative theory building toward cumulative science This article requires a subscription to view the full text. If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nCrises in science concern not only methods, statistics, and results but also, theory development. Beyond the indispensable refinement of tools and procedures, resolving crises would also benefit from a deeper understanding of the concepts and processes guiding research. Usually, theories compete, and some lose, incentivizing destruction of seemingly opposing views. This does not necessarily contribute to accumulating insights, and it may incur collateral damage (e.g., impairing cognitive processes and collegial relations). To develop a more constructive model, we built on adversarial collaboration, which integrates incompatible results into agreed-on new empirical research to test competing hypotheses [D. Kahneman, Am. Psychol. 58, 723-730 (2003)]. Applying theory and evidence from the behavioral sciences, we address the group dynamic complexities of adversarial interactions between scientists. We illustrate the added value of considering these in an \"adversarial alignment\" that addressed competing conceptual frameworks from five different theories of social evaluation. Negotiating a joint framework required two preconditions and several guidelines. First, we reframed our interactions from competitive rivalry to cooperative pursuit of a joint goal, and second, we assumed scientific competence and good intentions, enabling cooperation toward that goal. Then, we applied five rules for successful multiparty negotiations: 1) leveling the playing field, 2) capitalizing on curiosity, 3) producing measurable progress, 4) working toward mutual gain, and 5) being aware of the downside alternative. Together, these guidelines can encourage others to create conditions that allow for theoretical alignments and develop cumulative science.","99":"Afghanistan vs Ireland: Afghanistan Seals T20I Series Win Against Ireland | Cricket News Teenage spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman took three wickets to help Afghanistan beat Ireland by 21 runs and claim an unassailable 2-0 series lead in the second Twenty20 international in India on Sunday.

They achieve this by reaching new foreign customers. They may also get closer to sources of raw materials and thus reduce costs.\n\nCompanies can also internationalise without having a physical presence overseas or exporting their products abroad. They can internationalise by having their shares traded in overseas stock exchanges. Doing so can enable a company to access new sources of international funding. This can help overcome a lack of relatively cheap capital at home.\n\nCompanies can also appoint foreign directors to their boards. This can augment the skills base of a company's board of directors and other senior managers. Foreign directors can also represent those firms overseas and may enhance the firms' international reputation.\n\nMultinational companies have been much studied. However, the focus of these studies has been mostly restricted to subsidiaries of foreign companies operating in emerging economies.\n\nThis has left a huge gap. Hardly any research has been done on the impact of multinational companies that are born and bred on African soil. In a recent study, we provide new insights on the impact African multinationals have on their home countries.\n\nOur study\n\nWe used a sample size of 80 multinational companies listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSX) during the period 2011-2015. Coincidentally, the period of study was also preceded by the introduction of the Code of Corporate Governance for Public Companies in Nigeria issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2011.\n\nThis allowed us to assess how the sampled companies reconciled the demands of improved corporate governance regulations in Nigeria with the corporate governance demands of overseas jurisdictions where they also have operations.\n\nOur sample comprised companies operating in a wide range of sectors. These included financial services, consumer goods, agriculture, consumer services, health care, natural resources, and information, communications and technology.\n\nOf the 80 companies in our sample, approximately 19% were listed in Nigeria and elsewhere. Most of these cross-listed companies were listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and Euronext Paris exchanges (26.5% each) as well as the NSX. Another 20% were also listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Others were also listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the Ghana Stock Exchange, the SIX Swiss Exchange, and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.\n\nThe findings\n\nOur study found that African multinational companies had higher standards of corporate governance than other local firms. They served as yardsticks for good corporate governance practices.\n\nInternationalisation also helped African firms to disengage from home country shortcomings. These include corruption, tribalism and elitism. Elitism and tribalism, in this instance, refer to the appointment of directors on the basis of friendship or cronyism. These factors pose serious threats to the running and governance of companies in many African countries, including Nigeria.\n\nThese shortcomings, together with a widespread culture of patronage, have been cited as some of the biggest hindrances to Africa's economic development.\n\nConclusion and implications\n\nThere are two important implications of our study for policy makers and stakeholders of companies based in Africa and other emerging economies.\n\nFirstly, African based companies can enhance their reputation globally by listing their shares on overseas stock exchanges or appointing foreign directors onto their boards. Reputation is particularly important when a company seeks to enter foreign markets.\n\nLastly, multinational companies diffuse international best practices on corporate governance into their home markets. So, internationalisation can assist African companies to lessen the impact of local contextual challenges on their business and corporate governance practices. These include corruption, crony capitalism, and patronage and nepotism in corporate appointments.","102":"After SMEs, would the bigger boys get help? ANYONE earning less than RM4,000 in small and medium enterprises (SMEs) should have little to complain about.\n\nThe additional RM10bil stimulus package indirectly helps them keep their jobs for the next three months.\n\nThe RM1,200 wage subsidy per month for the next three months essentially incentivises a large number of SMEs to retain their workers.\n\nThe majority of SMEs are those employing less than 75 workers and they make up some 70% of the workforce in employment.\n\nOn average, they pay their workers a basic salary of between RM2,000 and RM3,000.\n\nThe workers get additional income from overtime and other claims.\n\nBefore the RM10bil additional stimulus package, most would have let their workers go.\n\nThis is because they face cash flow problems due to the inability to operate their business as usual in the last three weeks.\n\nThey expect the situation to continue for another two to three months, depending on how the world copes with the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWith the latest announcement of a RM1,200 wage subsidy per month, it gives them a good reason to retain their workers, which is what the government wants to see.\n\nIn the first stimulus package of RM250bil, the government effectively put money into the hands of the people directly.\n\nIt was a combination of direct financial assistance of up to RM1,600 and a reprieve from paying their loans and hire purchase instalments for six months.\n\nHowever, it did not assure them their jobs.\n\nThose employed in events management companies, for example, did not have much work to do for some time now since the outbreak.\n\nThe second stimulus helps employers in a large segment of SMEs to keep their workers.\n\nIf after this latest package, the employer decides to let go their workers, it is probably due to a change in the business model after the pandemic.\n\nNow that the grouses of the SMEs are addressed to a large extent, the big businesses that employ more than 200 workers should also be given attention.\n\nSome of the big Malaysian brands that employ thousands of locals are affected by the standstill in the economy and will not benefit from the stimulus packages.\n\nFor instance, a local hypermarket chain such as Mydin will not benefit much from the first and second stimulus packages.\n\nIt employs 10,000 workers, hence will only get some RM600 wage subsidy from the government.\n\nOn top of that, it has to continue paying all the benefits for employees.\n\nMydin's managing director Datuk Wira Ameer Ali Mydin said that their portion of the EPF contributions amounted to some RM1.3mil per month.\n\nTowards this end, he said some reprieve for employers of big businesses such as exemption from having to pay EPF for the next six months would help them with their cash flow.\n\n\"The MNCs have deep pockets and are able to survive this storm.\n\n\"Banks will only help big businesses that have certainty of cash flow.\n\n\"So exemptions from some payments will go a long way to help big businesses to keep going,\" he said.\n\nApart from measures to help with cash flow, manufacturers are also seeking relief from the government to help resume operations.\n\nTowards this end, the signal coming from the International Trade and Industry Ministry so far is mixed.\n\nA company manufacturing hard disk drives was given the green light to go ahead with operations but confined to 50% of its workforce.\n\nHowever, the same is not accorded to brewery companies.\n\nWhy the differentiation?\n\nThe second stimulus package is proof that the government is listening to the woes of the business community.\n\nThey probably already have feedback from the big businesses and are likely to come up with more measures in these extraordinary times.\n\nHopefully, the measures address the woes of all big businesses without discrimination of what they produce. After all, the government gets a slice of tax revenue from their profits, which is revenue that they can do with.\n\nThe views expressed here are entirely the writer's own.","103":"After a spate of closings, a new retail collective opens on Grand Avenue In a neighborhood beset by closings such as Creative Kidstuff, North Face, Traditions furnishings, Bonfire and Wild Onion, Grand Avenue in St. Paul has good news to share.

He was 85.\n\nKaline died at his home in Michigan. No cause of death was given.\n\nKaline was the youngest player to win the American League batting title in 1955 at age 20 with a .340 batting average. The right fielder was a 15-time All-Star, won 10 Gold Gloves and was elected into the Hall of Fame in 1980 in his first year of eligibility.\n\nThe beloved No. 6 later was a Tigers broadcaster for 26 years and was a special assistant to the general manager.\n\nKaline came straight out of Baltimore's Southern High School to the majors, making his debut on June 25, 1953 -- six days after being signed by Tigers scout Ed Katalinas. He took over as Detroit's everyday right fielder in 1954, and in 1955 he hit .340, becoming the youngest player -- besting Ty Cobb by a day -- to win the batting title.\n\nKaline never hit 30 home runs in a season and topped the 100-RBI mark only three times, but his overall consistency at the plate and his exceptional fielding and throwing put him among the top AL outfielders.\n\n\"There have been a lot of great defensive players. The fella who could do everything is Al Kaline,\" Orioles Hall of Famer Brooks Robinson once said. \"He was just the epitome of what a great outfielder is all about -- great speed, catches the ball and throws the ball well.\"\n\nKaline finished his career with 3,007 hits and 399 homers (what would have been No. 400 was lost to a rainout). He scored over 1,600 runs and drove in nearly that many. He got his 3,000th hit in Baltimore, a double in September 1974, his final season.\n\nKaline hit .379 in the Tigers' victory over St. Louis in the 1968 World Series, when Detroit rallied from a 3-1 deficit.\n\n\"If there is one accomplishment for which I am particularly proud it is that I've always served baseball to the best of my ability,\" Kaline said during his Hall of Fame induction speech. \"Never have I deliberately done anything to discredit the game, the Tigers or my family.\n\n\"By far, being inducted into the Hall of Fame is the proudest moment of my life. You can be sure that I will make every effort to live up to the obligation associated with this honor.\"\n\nLater that year, his No. 6 became the first number retired by the Tigers.","106":"Al Kaline, 1934-2020: Mr. Tiger's grace transcended... Before the final game in the 88-year history of Tiger Stadium, one player spoke on behalf of more than 1,300 Tigers who had stood on the field and worn the Olde English D. In the afternoon sun, Al Kaline grabbed the microphone, stood near home plate and began speaking to the crowd: mothers and fathers, sons and daughters, all those who loved baseball and loved Detroit and suddenly felt gripped by the words of a Tigers hero.\n\nKaline -- the man they called Mr. Tiger, the one who hit 399 career home runs and dazzled in the outfield with a certain elegance no other Motor City baseball player could quite match -- talked about the old ballpark in its final days. He remarked on how its beauty was not found in dazzling architecture or creature comforts. He mentioned how it was built with concrete, steel and bricks, but held together with the powerful glue of memories. The true strength of Tiger Stadium, Kaline said, was derived from its \"character, charm and history.\"\n\nKaline was dazzling, graceful, wonderful as a player. But perhaps you could say the same about him. Character, charm and history. Kaline died Monday at age 85 at his home in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. His departure was felt in Detroit, in Michigan, across all of baseball.\n\n\"We lost an icon,\" said Alan Trammell, the Tigers Hall of Fame shortstop. \"He will never be forgotten, but he can't be replaced.\"\n\nKaline was born on Dec. 19, 1934, the son of a Baltimore broom maker. He made his major-league debut at age 18, a week after graduating high school, a face so young security workers at first refused to let him into the stadium. His presence never really left Detroit for the next 66 years. His spirit will be felt even longer.\n\nKaline played 22 seasons for the Tigers. He had a lifetime batting average of .297, amassed 3,007 career hits and won 10 Gold Gloves. He was a first-ballot Hall of Famer. He called games as a color analyst from 1975-2002. He spent his later years as a special assistant in the Tigers' front office.\n\nAnd even up until his final days, Kaline was a common sight in spring training, wearing a blue jersey and baseball pants, working with outfielders. He would still stop by Comerica Park during the season, and sometimes you could find Kaline alone before a game, perched over the dugout railing, gazing out onto the field.\n\nTigers fans of a certain era grew up wanting to be Al Kaline. They tossed baseballs up in their backyards, envisioned they wore No. 6 and tracked down balls in the right-field corner. They emulated his batting stance, tacked his poster to bedroom walls. He resonated with common fans and modern stars alike.\n\n\"Such a kind and generous man who meant so much to so many,\" Justin Verlander posted on Twitter. \"I hope you knew how much I enjoyed our conversations about baseball, life, or just giving each other a hard time. I am honored to have been able to call you my friend for all these years.\"\n\nKaline, too, was available to all in his orbit. John Hicks, a former Tigers catcher, posted about Kaline grabbing him and putting him in headlocks by his locker. Late last September, Kaline huddled close with rookie catcher Jake Rogers in the back of the clubhouse, talking about hitting.\n\n\"Al Kaline was one of the best people and players of all-time,\" Rogers posted on Twitter. \"I always enjoyed our conversations and will forever cherish those.\"\n\nTigers pitcher Matthew Boyd wrote of Kaline's welcoming ways and his listening ear. Fellow pitcher Daniel Norris wrote of Kaline's love and compassion. \"He taught us about baseball,\" Norris wrote, \"but more importantly he taught us how to be better men.\"\n\nOn that final night at Tiger Stadium, Kaline approached a young hitter named Robert Fick in the clubhouse before the game. Kaline told Fick he would hit a home run that day. Fick was a rookie, and simply being in Kaline's presence was an honor. In the eighth inning of that game, Fick hit a grand slam off the famed right-field roof, the go-ahead hit and a searing moment in Tigers lore. In an interview last summer, Fick told The Athletic he once wanted to name his son Kaline.\n\n\"Al was ... talk about a God,\" Fick said. \"Just a classy man. Once you meet him, you know why he only has 399 career home runs. Because no human being on the earth would walk away from the game with 399 home runs. But that didn't mean anything to him. The stats don't mean anything to him. He was just great.\"\n\nAfter that game, legends from Tigers history gathered behind the center field fence. They all came out one by one, taking the field at Tiger Stadium one final time. Kaline received the loudest ovation. He called it one of the best nights of his life.\n\nThe Tigers introduced double-play duo Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker together, the final players to take the field. Trammell was not quite comfortable with the honor, because he believed it should have belonged to Kaline.\n\n\"I felt very strongly that Mr. Tiger should have been the last guy,\" Trammell said. \"I told him, and Al, as gracious as he always is, said, 'Don't worry about it, it isn't a big deal to me.'\"\n\nStrange as it seems, there was a time in Kaline's career when he grew on edge. A salary dispute in 1956 led to him getting booed. He played through injuries and broke bats. He became a little more guarded, a little more surly with reporters. Eventually the hard feelings passed and Kaline's kindness shone through. He retired as a legend. And his defining trait -- more than the 1968 World Series, more than the statue in the Comerica Park outfield, more than the No. 6 adorned to the stadium's walls -- is the way he was always there.\n\n\"It was consistency,\" said Jim Leyland, the former Tigers manager.\n\nKaline touched lives from Leyland to Kirk Gibson to newly drafted kids. Last summer, Tigers first-round pick Riley Greene took batting practice in Comerica Park, blasting balls over the right-field fence like a young Kaline. Kaline stood behind the batting cage with a watchful eye, later complimenting Greene's power, passing the torch on down a little further.\n\n\"Someone that was always willing to give back,\" Tigers shortstop Niko Goodrum wrote. \"A man that always made you feel good about yourself and gave you hope when you were in his presence.\"\n\nKaline's impact was felt on the field, in the booth, in the stands. And now, it will always be felt in our memories.\n\nThis spring, everyone knew Kaline's health was declining. He still made the trip to Lakeland, what became his final spring training. One night, he and his wife, Madge Louise, shared dinner with Leyland. \"It was kind of eerie, almost,\" Leyland said over the phone Monday.\n\nThey laughed and told old stories, men who have known each other since Leyland was a minor-league catcher in the 1960s.\n\nThey went back to the hotel that evening, and before parting ways, Kaline stopped Leyland, and he pulled him in for a hug. A Kaline gesture if there ever were one.","107":"Al Vento quietly calls it quits in south Minneapolis The bar has been emptied of liquor and glassware. The walls have been stripped of artworks. A Realtor's lockbox hangs from a rear door.\n\nStill, there's no actual \"Closed\" sign posted anywhere at Al Vento (5001 34th Av. S., Mpls.), and the restaurant's social media accounts remain quiet. But the 15-year-old restaurant has quietly called it quits.\n\nIt's a shame. Chef\/owner Jonathan Hunt created a model neighborhood restaurant, one that not only served its surrounding neighbors but drew diners from across the Twin Cities.\n\nBack in 2004, Hunt, a veteran of the former Pane Vino Dolce, took over - and improved upon -- a short-lived gem, Marimar.\n\nIt was an immediate hit. Al Vento (Italian for \"to the wind\") was one of three restaurants named that year's Restaurant of the Year by the Star Tribune, a trio of neighborhood bistros that also included the now-departed Corner Table and A Rebours.\n\nRegulars will fondly recall the four-course, $20 Tuesday date night, the cozy all-season porch\/patio, the well-made pastas and pizzas and the reasonably priced, all-Italian wine list.\n\nHunt went on to launch two other restaurants. Rinata, which is still cooking at 25th and Hennepin in Uptown Minneapolis, opened in 2008. In 2012, Hunt turned to the Bryn Mawr neighborhood and opened Sparks, which had a six-year run; the space is now occupied by La Mesa.","108":"Albanese accuses Facebook of shrugging off fakery The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations\n\nOpposition leader Anthony Albanese is sharply critical of Facebook for failing to remove false material, in a speech on democracy in which he condemns the \"echo chambers\" created by social media.\n\nAlbanese recounts his own recent experience to highlight Facebook's intransigence, saying when he complained about an image altered from his page \"they shrugged\", saying \"it wasn't a breach of community guidelines\".\n\nThe speech, Albanese's third \"vision statement\", was released ahead of its Saturday delivery.\n\nCondemning online platforms for being unwilling to filter out false information, he rejects the arguments they use.\n\n\"[Facebook chief executive] Mark Zuckerberg says he thinks people should be able to see what politicians are saying.

Well, I do.\n\n\"And it begs the question: if this doesn't breach community standards, then what does?\n\n\"And perhaps more importantly - why do Facebook's laws of the jungle trump Australia's laws of the land?\n\n\"What then happens when platforms become so complacent with misinformation that they become unable to filter it out?\"\n\nIn his address Albanese declares war on the culture wars, calls for more constructive national conversations about the big issues such as climate change, and urges a toning down of the anger and outrage in public debate.\n\n\"This increased volume of anger and misinformation is robbing our political debates of civility and making the public's poor opinion of our political system much, much worse.\n\n\"It's something we can't afford. Surveys are finding that fewer and fewer people are satisfied with the way our democracy works and that some are losing faith in democracy altogether.\n\n\"The University of Canberra has found that satisfaction with our democracy has more than halved in the last decade, down from 86% to 41%.\"\n\nAlbanese criticises the government for attacking freedom of the press and the right to protest, calling for changes to protect press freedom to be enshrined \"in a bipartisan way\".\n\nHe also says there should be a requirement for a parliamentary debate when Australia is committing to participate in a war, although he does not argue parliamentary approval should be required.\n\n\"I understand there are those who passionately believe that a parliamentary vote should precede the deployment of our troops in conflict overseas. I also understand there is a long tradition of the executive making these decisions alone.\n\n\"Our parliamentarians should, at the very least, be given the chance to express their view following a cabinet decision to go to war\".\n\nHe points to the two days of parliamentary debate the Hawke government allowed after its cabinet decided to join the first Gulf War.\n\n\"At their best these debates in parliament are an exercise in transparency and accountability. And this is a practice that should continue.\n\n\"Many democratic nations have parliamentary debate and transparency around their deployments. Including in the United Kingdom, where there is now a higher parliamentary threshold for decisions to go to war.\n\n\"And after all, our greatest ally, the United States, has a war powers act.\n\n\"We can't ask people to put their lives on the line if we as legislators are too afraid to put our arguments on the line\".\n\nCanvassing reforms to parliament, he suggests an independent speaker and a parliamentary integrity commissioner \"to align the conduct of our parliamentarians with community expectations.\"\n\nOn indigenous recognition, Albanese reasserts Labor's view that the indigenous voice to parliament should be enshrined in the constitution, a position rejected by Scott Morrison.\n\n\"The government has ruled out constitutional enshrinement from the beginning - and deliberately misrepresented the concept to turn Australians against each other. That's incredibly disappointing.\n\n\"But the best way to proceed, as in most circumstances, is to\n\nkeep talking, keep working, keep progressing. That's what we intend to do until a voice that can heal and unify is finally achieved,\" he says.\n\nNext week Albanese will tour regional Queensland where he will visit mining and aluminium smelting enterprises, underlining the contrast between him and his predecessor Bill Shorten. In his speech he stresses that advocates of change need to understand the viewpoints of those who will feel insecure by that change. He says the anti-Adani convoy into the coal mining town of Clermont \"was not helpful\".","109":"Alex Stalock starts, Luke Kunin returns for Wild in showdown with Predators Again, the out-of-town scores went the Wild's way Monday night while the team was idle.\n\nBut even if the team wins Tuesday against the Predators at Xcel Energy Center, it'll need some more help to reach a playoff position.\n\nThe Wild trails the Predators by just one point for the second wild card seed. But Winnipeg is tied with Nashville at 72 points and is also in action Tuesday, taking on Buffalo. A loss by the Jets in any manner combined with a Wild win would move the team into a playoff spot.\n\n\"These games are a ton of fun,\" goalie Alex Stalock said. \"To leapfrog a team and put yourself in contention is a great opportunity, and I know the guys in here are looking forward to it.\"\n\nThis is the second half of a back-to-back for the Predators, who were thumped 8-3 at home Monday by the Oilers. But Nashville has had the upper hand in its season series vs. the Wild, winning both games and outscoring the Wild 9-2.\n\n\"Everybody knows the table is set out there for where we're at in the standings and where they are,\" Stalock said. \"Obviously what happened in their building last night, they're not going to be too happy. So, it's going to be a fun game tonight.\"\n\nFor a fifth straight time, the Wild will call upon Stalock in net. He's 7-2-1 in his last 10 starts with a 1.99 goals-against average, .925 save percentage and two shutouts.\n\nForward Luke Kunin will also be back in action after missing the last five games with an upper-body injury.\n\n\"Watching is never fun,\" Kunin said. \"It's been good to get back. The guys have been playing really well, and I'm just happy to be back in the lineup.\"\n\nMarcus Foligno-Alex Galchenyuk-Mats Zuccarello\n\n8-5-2: Record for the Wild vs. Predators in their last 15 matchups at Xcel Energy Center.\n\n9: Points for winger Kevin Fiala during a four-game point streak.\n\nNashville's loss to Edmonton Monday was the team's second straight setback. Before that, the Predators had won three in a row and six out of seven. Goalie Juuse Saros is expected to get the start. He's 3-0 in his career against the Wild, recording a 0.65 goals-against average and .976 save percentage with two shutouts. Center Ryan Johansen has 20 points in 28 career games vs. the Wild.","110":"Alkali magmatism on a carbonaceous chondrite planetesimal In spite of magnetic and isotopic evidence revealing connections between the most primitive outer Solar System materials and differentiated bodies with a layered structure akin to terrestrial planets, the meteoritic record lacks samples that document the initiation of partial melting and the onset of planetary differentiation. Here, we describe a trachybasalt formed by very limited partial melting of a carbonaceous chondrite and crystallized as a dyke during ascent through the chondritic crust. This sample testifies of partial differentiation of outer Solar System carbonaceous planetesimals and can be considered as the long-sought first melt produced in differentiating small bodies.\n\nRecent isotopic and paleomagnetic data point to a possible connection between carbonaceous chondrites and differentiated planetary materials, suggesting the existence, perhaps ephemeral, of transitional objects with a layered structure whereby a metal-rich core is enclosed by a silicate mantle, which is itself overlain by a crust containing an outermost layer of primitive solar nebula materials. This idea has not received broad support, mostly because of a lack of samples in the meteoritic record that document incipient melting at the onset of planetary differentiation. Here, we report the discovery and the petrologic-isotopic characterization of UH154-11, a ferroan trachybasalt fragment enclosed in a Renazzo-type carbonaceous chondrite (CR). Its chemical and oxygen isotopic compositions are consistent with very-low-degree partial melting of a Vigarano-type carbonaceous chondrite (CV) from the oxidized subgroup at a depth where fluid-assisted metamorphism enhanced the Na content. Its microdoleritic texture indicates crystallization at an increasing cooling rate, such as would occur during magma ascent through a chondritic crust. This represents direct evidence of magmatic activity in a carbonaceous asteroid on the verge of differentiating and demonstrates that some primitive outer Solar System objects related to icy asteroids and comets underwent a phase of magmatic activity early in the Solar System. With its peculiar petrology, UH154-11 can be considered the long-sought first melt produced during partial differentiation of a carbonaceous chondritic planetary body, bridging a previously persistent gap in differentiation processes from icy cometary bodies to fully melted iron meteorites with isotopic affinities to carbonaceous chondrites.","111":"All Disney Films Getting Delayed Due To Coronavirus - New Release Dates - OtakuKart The house of mouse is one few late entrants that are delaying their summer film season and other films this year due to the recent COVID-19 pandemic.

The 24-year-old Indian squandered a sparkling start as Okuhara produced a rearguard action to outwit Sindhu 12-21 21-15 21-13 in a 68-minute last eight encounter at the Arena Birmimgham. Sindhu's defeat ended India's campaign at the Super 1000 tournament. Sindhu had come into the match with a 9-7 head-to-head record against Okuhara, having demolished the Japanese in the finals of the 2019 World Championships.\n\nThe Indian started the match with the same intensity, quickly moving to a 3-0 lead and then swelling the advantage to 7-2 with a precise shot at the backline.\n\nThe Japanese narrowed the gap to 5-8 before Sindhu unleashed a shot at the back and then grabbed another point when Okuhara found the net. Sindhu entered the break with a five-point cushion.\n\nThe Indian continued to dominate the proceedings after the breather, putting her opponent under pressure to gather points at will.\n\nOkuhara got a few points with her straight and cross court smashes but those were too few as Sindhu zoomed to 18-9.\n\nWith Okuhara's weak returns going to the nets, Sindhu had a massive 20-11 advantage.\n\nThe Indian quickly sealed the opening game when Okuhara erred again. After the change of sides, Okuahara showed more intent, employing a low service and tried to put Sindhu on the back foot. It worked as she took a 5-2 lead.\n\nThe Japanese engaged Sindhu in fierce rallies and forced her to make errors to lead 7-3.\n\nA couple of unforced errors from Okuhara helped Sindhu to narrow the gap.\n\nA cross-court shot and return of serve helped Sindhu keep it to 8-10 before Okuhara entered the mid-game interval with a three-point lead. Okuhara didn't let the momentum slip after the break as Sindhu failed to keep pace in the rallies.\n\nThe result was that the Japanese jumped to a 16-9 lead in a jiffy. With Sindhu going long twice, Okuhara led 18-10 and soon roared back into the contest when Sindhu found the net after saving three game points.\n\nIn the decider, Okuhara continued to dictate the pace of the rallies, leading 5-2 early on. The Japanese didn't allow Sindhu to attack, reducing the Indian to play the retrieving game. A stunning return at the deep forehand of Sindhu gave Okuhara a 8-3 lead.\n\nThe lightening quick Okuhara left Sindhu frustrated with her speed and placement as she grabbed a 11-5 advantage at the interval. Errors continued to pile up for the Indian as Okuhara took a 16-7 lead.\n\nSindhu missed the lines and found the net regularly to allow Okuhara move to 19-11.

AEG Live is planning two big Prince tribute shows for later this month in London. Three members of New Power Generation, Prince's 1990s backup band, have been presenting a Purple tribute at the Parkway Theater in Minneapolis.\n\nBilled as This Thing Called Life, the NPG concert, which played twice over the weekend and concludes its run on Wednesday, has the right spirit but doesn't quite live up to a Princely standard.\n\nOn Saturday night, the 14-member band -- starring ex-NPGers Michael Bland on drums, Sonny Thompson on bass and Tommy Barbarella on keyboards -- lacked the precision and crispness of a Prince ensemble. If he'd witnessed that performance, he would have had them rehearsing for four more hours after their two 70-minute sets featuring everything from \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\" and \"Little Red Corvette\" to \"Strange Relationship\" and \"Gold.\" Plus, the sound system was inadequate, especially after Prince fans have experienced Paisley Park's best-in-the-business system for years.\n\nNonetheless, the evening was fitting and necessary as both a musical tonic and spiritual uplift for Prince fans -- including ones from Australia and Seattle -- still grieving over his death seven weeks ago. To hear more than 30 Prince-penned songs delivered by an all-star Twin Cities band was a treat, especially when the Hornheads, a five-person horn section that had played with Prince, joined in the second set.\n\nAs the Hornheads came strutting down the aisle to the stage, they instantly invigorated \"Willing and Able,\" an obscure 1991 tune with a great gospel-soul groove. Kathy Jensen's sax solo put the sexiness in \"Girls and Boys.\" The horns made \"America\" into a funky, swinging celebration and the highlight of the concert. There was no question that the Hornheads added much-needed dimension, texture and urgency to the evening.\n\nAnother key player was Jamecia Bennett, the Sounds of Blackness mainstay who mostly sang fiery backup vocals in this context. But when she turned \"Nothing Compares 2 U\" into a duet, Julius Collins, who handled lead vocals all night, was no match for her. She's a gospel-trained roof raiser.\n\nCollins, best known for his work in the funk-rock band Greazy Meal and in local theater productions, tried valiantly to sound like Prince, but his falsetto wasn't consistent, his moves weren't dazzling and his passion wasn't always palpable (though he got so wrapped up in a wonderful \"Sometimes It Snows in April\" that he was in tears by song's end). He might have been more successful trying to do the songs his way, which is what Bennett did.\n\nAlso Collins had to compete with a constant barrage of photos and videos of Prince appearing on a big screen behind the stage. Seeing the images of such an expressive, dynamic hero was distracting and disconcerting, provoking a strange sadness during a program designed to celebrate the joy of Prince's music.","118":"Amanda Holden speaks out on Simon Cowell's weight loss Amanda Holden has confessed her friend and Britain's Got Talent boss Simon Cowell's weight loss 'is crazy.'\n\nSpeaking ahead of the launch of the new series of the ITV show this weekend, Amanda admitted that Simon's 20Ib weight loss has been hard to miss.\n\nThe music and TV mogul lost the impressive amount of weight after adopting a healthier vegan lifestyle last year, and Amanda is hoping for other big changes in her pal too.\n\nShocked: Amanda Holden has confessed her friend and Britain's Got Talent boss Simon Cowell's weight loss 'is crazy'\n\n'It's crazy because when you see someone all the time you don't really notice when they are putting on weight,' she said.\n\n'With Simon it was such a gradual thing, but I noticed immediately that he had lost weight.

Senior Amber Fiser pitched in 46 of the Gophers' 60 games last season. Her senior season - like so many - has been cut short. Will she move on or take advantage of an added year granted by the NCAA?\n\nThe Gophers softball team was flying to the Tampa Bay area on Feb. 7, with two games scheduled the next day to start the Division I Leadoff Classic in Clearwater, Fla.\n\nThe Delta flight ran into major turbulence as it neared the Florida border, the passengers rocked and rolled for a time, and the plane eventually was diverted to Melbourne, Fla. The Gophers spent the night in a hotel there, had a noon game moved to 6 p.m. and the adventure was started:\n\nTwenty-nine nonconference games scheduled in Florida (two Clearwater tournaments), Alabama, Texas, California and Hawaii, capped by a return flight from Honolulu that reached home last Saturday.\n\nIt was an amazing bookend of travel:\n\nThe first flight of the season brought tears to several collegians who had never experienced such uncertainty in the air, and the last flight brought them home from waves splashing on Waikiki Beach to an uncertainty that not even us septuagenarians have experienced.\n\n\"We got to Honolulu on Sunday night, had a beach day on Monday, visited Pearl Harbor -- which was very meaningful -- on Tuesday,'' pitcher Amber Fiser said. \"Our first game was against Hawaii on Wednesday night, which was after midnight in Minnesota.\n\n\"[Coach Jamie Trachsel] was keeping us up to date on the way things were changing back home, but you're out there in paradise, playing a game, and it's hard to imagine your season is going to be stopped.''\n\nThe last pitch Fiser threw as a senior was bounced to shortstop Carlie Brandt, another senior, for an out, and a 3-2 victory for the Gophers.\n\nThe Gophers were getting ready for an afternoon game with Texas Tech when Trachsel came with the news that spring sports were being canceled by the NCAA. The last flight for the 2020 Gophers was a red-eye out of Honolulu late on Friday night.\n\nA year ago, the Gophers made a surprise run to the eight-team Women's College World Series, behind the tremendous pitching of Fiser. Now they were finished with a 15-9-1 record, shut down a week before their Big Ten schedule would start in Columbus, Ohio.\n\n\"There are so many thoughts ... for friends, for family, really for everyone, as we face this virus,'' Fiser said. \"I'm also thinking of teammates. The seniors I've been with for four years.

Scintillating figures with dragon breath, some in yellow, some in blue. Norwich City is playing Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League. Teemu Pukki, Norwich's fiercely scurrying Finnish striker, receives -- or magnetically attracts -- a long, searching ball from Mario Vran\u010di\u0107 onto his chest; angles it into his own path; and then, slicing between two Tottenham defenders, zeroes it past the scrambling goalkeeper and into the back of the net. Beautiful. The goal-scorer wheels away in triumph, the home crowd goes nuts, shazam -- a lightning ripple of sport-induced gladness zips around the world.\n\nBut wait, hang on ... Oh, Christ. VAR. The Video Assistant Referee system, reviled innovation of the current Premier League season, is \"checking\" the goal. One hundred fifty miles away, in London, footage is being reviewed. We're in limbo. A vacuum occupies the broadcast booth; the crowd shifts, grumbles, in a haze of spoiling endorphins. Then, on the big screen, there it is: goal disallowed. A haggard roar goes up. It has been determined that Pukki, at the moment that Vran\u010di\u0107 sent the ball his way, was microscopically -- with perhaps the outer edge of his shoulder -- ahead of the deepest-lying Spurs defender. In other words, he was offside. The referee didn't see it; the linesmen didn't see it; the crowd didn't see it; the Tottenham players didn't see it. Nobody saw it. But the faceless invigilators of VAR, in their multiscreen hive -- they saw it. Sorry, Pukki. Sorry, universe. Wind back the spool of joy. No goal.\n\nWatching VAR happen, watching this huge, technocratic toad lower its clumsy haunches onto the beautiful and mobile game of soccer, I feel ill. Fans of the NBA, the NFL, Major League Baseball, and the other leagues using this kind of surveillance will understand. I feel, as William James put it, menaced and negated in the springs of my innermost life.\n\nI think about all the layers of finicking supervision and overweening scrutiny to which we subject ourselves: the preposterous standards, the insensate judgments, the malign fantasy of perfectibility that has overtaken even our moments of play. And it is a fantasy. Mike Riley, the chief referee of the Premier League, recently identified four instances in which valid decisions by on-field officials had been overruled by video review.\n\nAs for the Pukki decision, it might have been, in the narrowest and most metrical sense, right. But everything else about it is wrong: the second-guessing, the flow-reversal, the sheer bummer of the process. The VAR world -- with its obscure vectors and subatomic infringements -- is just not what soccer is. Not what reality is.\n\nSo here's to being fallible, to honoring the possibilities of the ever-running moment by accepting that some of those possibilities are wrong. We live our lives in negotiation with entropy, do we not? A tolerance for error is a must. Not for injustice, not for corruption, but for the honest mistake, made in real time. Solomon himself blew a call now and again. So what? It's a universal condition. It's the universal condition. You don't hit Pause and summon the immaculate arbitrators. You don't wait for the screen to tell you what happened. You don't stop the game until the game is over.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nPre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) splicing is a crucial step in eukaryotic gene expression. The recognition of the splice sites in pre-mRNA transcripts is initiated by the essential splicing factor U2AF2 that binds to the poly-pyrimidine tract (Py-tract) RNA upstream of exons to assemble the spliceosome. Py-tract sequences are often degenerate, with a wide range of binding affinities and activity. Here, we demonstrate that autoinhibitory intramolecular interactions of a linker region and the RNA binding domains of U2AF2 establish binding selectivity for strong Py-tracts. Disrupting the linker interactions results in dispersed binding to weak Py-tracts and impacts on splicing fidelity. This demonstrates that the binding specificity of RNA binding proteins can involve flanking regions of the canonical RNA binding domains.","124":"Analysis | Who's to Blame for Fallen Angels and Sinking Demons? Granted, agencies have a moral hazard: They get paid by the issuers they rate. But are they really responsible for so many fallen angels and sinking demons? As I noted last week, the leveraged loan space has ballooned over the past decade, largely because the savvy private equity industry has been stuffing this market with low-quality, covenant-lite issues just a notch shy of CCC.\n\nThe Federal Reserve is clearly worried. On March 23, it established a facility to buy corporate bonds issued by investment-grade U.S. companies, though it's still loath to make direct loans to ones in distress. Since the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, the central bank hasn't been allowed to take big credit risks and can only lend with a high degree of protection, either buying assets super cheap or being backed by the Treasury's money. So passing down lower borrowing costs through the pipeline of investment-grade corporate bonds might seem like a good idea.","125":"Ancient engineering of fish capture and storage in southwest Florida This article requires a subscription to view the full text.

The skull looks remarkably bird-like and a number of features suggested that Oculudentavis might actually be related to the early ancestors of modern birds.\n\nThat would make this fossil the smallest dinosaur ever discovered, and for a time this was what researchers thought, but a closer look revealed that it was actually probably a lizard. Among other details, Oculudentavis appeared to possess teeth that were fused to the jaw bone, whereas dinosaur teeth sit in bony sockets. The fossil appears to have preserved some of the lizard's original bodily material, allowing another team of scientists to spot the error and issue a correction.\n\nThe researchers from China and the US who studied the fossil subjected it to CT analysis (computed tomography, which uses X-rays to produce a series of cross-section images of a specimen) to examine the internal structure. But the amber is sufficiently clear that many of the features can be seen with the naked eye and a hand lens.\n\nOculudentavis has a long slender snout, a mouthful of needle-sharp teeth and massive eyes. Unlike most fossils, in which the original material is replaced by other minerals, the skull still appears to be composed of actual bone, although its microstructure and possible cell content have yet to be analysed.\n\nSome of the skin of the palate and the tongue is also preserved, including the small pointed papillae on its surface. These may have worked in the same way as modern passerine birds such as the robin, whose tongue bumps are directed backwards and prevent prey escaping from the mouth.\n\nSadly the rest of the animal's body is not preserved - some of the organic material decayed to produce what is now a yucky mess. Perhaps it exists in another amber fragment awaiting discovery.\n\nOne particularly revealing feature is the skull's huge orbit (eye socket). A circle of tiny bony plates known as a sclerotic ring is arranged within the orbit, forming a cone with an inner circle that indicates the creature would have had a very small pupil. This kind of eye is typical of many lizards of today that are active during the day and sleep at night, suggesting that Oculudentavis had a similar \"diurnal\" schedule.\n\nSignificant find\n\nThe discovery of Oculudentavis is all the more fascinating because it was found in amber. Almost all fossils are formed from the hard remains of animals and plants: bones, teeth, shells and wood. But the amber has preserved some of the soft tissues of the lizard, making it a very unlikely fossil.\n\nAmber starts off as a sticky liquid resin oozing from wounds on trees. But as volatile chemicals evaporate from its surface, the resin hardens into lumps that take some hammering to remove from the tree. This means it is even more unlikely that such an ancient creature would get preserved in amber. The largest piece of amber ever discovered weighs a mere 15kg.\n\nThe fossilised remains of Oculudentavis will be rich in all sorts of chemical decay products that can often be traced back to original biomolecules. Unfortunately it is doubtful that any DNA remains. DNA is such a delicate molecule that it rarely survives more than a few thousand years in humans, perhaps as much as 17,000 years in other animals and just maybe around a million years in fossilised bacteria.\n\nOculudentavis isn't the first creature to be found in amber. In 2016, researchers reported a piece of amber also from Myanmar with the tail of feathered dinosaur.\n\nOculudentavis may not have turned out to be a mini dinosaur, but it's still an amazing discovery. And who knows, one day we might yet find more dinosaur fragments in amber.\n\nThis article was amended on March 26 to correct errors following the misidentification of Oculudentavis as a dinosaur.","127":"Announcing Inventera, the Sequel to Nino Cipri's Finna We're excited to announce that author Nino Cipri is returning to the multi-dimensional world of their rambunctious and touching novella, Finna.

The iPad rejected the idea of a keyboard, a trackpad, or even a stylus, and Apple mocked Microsoft for taking that exact approach with the Surface. \"Our competition is different, they're confused,\" said Apple CEO Tim Cook as he stood onstage to introduce the new Macs and iPads six years ago. \"They chased after netbooks, now they're trying to make PCs into tablets and tablets into PCs. Who knows what they will do next?\"\n\nEvery iPad has transformed into a Surface in recent years, and as of this week, the iPad Pro and Surface Pro look even more alike. Both have detachable keyboards, adjustable stands, trackpads, and styluses. With iPadOS getting cursor and mouse support this week, Apple has finally admitted that Microsoft was right about tablets. Let me explain why.\n\nMicrosoft's return to tablets was a rough ride and far from perfect. Bill Gates tried to convince the world that tablets would be a thing all the way back in 2002, but the hardware and software were far too primitive back then. The software maker eventually introduced the Surface RT alongside Windows 8 in 2012 as a clear response to the iPad, but it had an ARM-powered desktop operating system that didn't support your favorite apps. It was slightly confused, but Microsoft's tablet principles were clear at the time.\n\n\"Something is different about tablets, people still do desire a physical keyboard,\" wrote former Windows chief Steven Sinofsky in a detailed blog post about Windows 8 back in 2012. \"Even in the absence of software like Microsoft Office, the reality is that when you need to write more than a few quick lines of text, you yearn for something better than on-screen typing ... People benefit from the highly accurate, reliable, and fast user input enabled by a physical keyboard, and we think an OS and its apps should not compromise when one is available.\"\n\nThe message was clear: touch-based computing would be a first-class input for Windows 8 but not the only way to use the operating system. Microsoft insisted you needed a mouse for precision, a keyboard for typing, and a stylus for taking notes or drawing. These basic foundations led to the Surface Pro, with its variety of inputs to suit different needs.\n\nMicrosoft also mastered the ability to use a tablet at a desk or on a couch, thanks to its Surface kickstand and hinge designs. It was a key differentiator against devices like the iPad, and Microsoft and Intel now license out the design for other PC makers to use. It didn't take long for everyone to start copying Microsoft's Surface design.\n\nEven Apple moved quickly to respond to the Surface, a year after Microsoft released a stunning new design with the Surface Pro 3. Apple's first iPad Pro debuted in 2015 with support for the Apple Pencil stylus and a smart keyboard. It arrived just as iPad sales had declined to the point where Apple was making more money on Macs instead. The iPad Pro keyboard magnetically attached to the iPad Pro, just like the Surface Pro, but Apple claimed it was \"unlike any keyboard you've ever used before.\"\n\nIt marked a big shift for the iPad, and every big iPad now supports a keyboard and stylus. Despite the hardware additions, Apple persisted with its touch-first vision for the iPad. Using a keyboard with the iPad was an ergonomic disaster. You'd have to lift your hands away from the keyboard to touch the screen and adjust text or simply navigate around the OS. It didn't feel natural, and the large touch targets meant there was no precision for more desktop-like apps. Alongside Apple's refusal to bring touchscreen support to the Mac, it was clear something had to change.\n\nThe first signs of a new direction for the iPad arrived with iPadOS and the hints at cursor support last year. Apple is now introducing trackpad and mouse support fully in iPadOS, and you can use an existing Bluetooth device. Unlike pointer support you'd find in Windows or macOS, Apple has taken a clever approach to bringing it to a touch-friendly OS like iPadOS. The pointer only appears when you need it, and it's a circular dot that can change its shape based on what you're pointing at. That means you can use it for precision tasks like spreadsheets or simply use multitouch gestures on a trackpad to navigate around iPadOS.\n\nIt's far more than most people were expecting at this stage, and Apple has importantly kept its touch-friendly iPad principles intact. Right now, you still can't use this mouse support to drag and drop windows on top of each other freely like you might on Windows or macOS. Nor is it there to do everything you'd typically do with a mouse on a desktop operating system. Apple has adapted a legacy input and modernized it for iPadOS.\n\nThis careful and considered approach explains why it took Apple so long to bring cursor support to iPadOS. Tim Cook has previously discussed product trade-offs and the idea of converging PCs and tablets. \"Anything can be forced to converge, but the problem is that products are about tradeoffs, and you begin to make tradeoffs to the point where what you have left doesn't please anyone,\" Cook said on an earnings call nearly eight years ago. He famously added: \"You can converge a toaster and a refrigerator, but those things are probably not gonna be pleasing to the user.\"\n\nCook was also adamant that Apple wouldn't converge the MacBook Air and an iPad. \"The compromise of convergence -- we're not going to that party,\" he said. Cook has stayed true to that vision. Apple hasn't converged macOS and iPadOS to bring trackpad and mouse support to the iPad. Instead, the message for the iPad now is that it can adapt to be more like a laptop or remain just like a tablet.\n\nThat message sounds similar to Microsoft's Surface Pro, but what's now at play is a battle of ecosystems, apps, and operating systems. Microsoft has persisted with Windows and walked back many of its touch-friendly tablet changes. The software maker is even diverging Windows further into a Windows 10X operating system for dual-screen devices this year.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple is hoping that iPadOS could be enough for people who want some laptop familiarity. With the essential trackpad support and improvements to the Safari web browser, the iPad is starting to look like a much more viable option for both a tablet and a laptop for many. That's a big change from just a few years ago.\n\nNow that Apple and Microsoft are aligned on what a tablet can offer in terms of hardware, the battle between PC and iPad will shift toward what both do in software. Apple has shown that it's willing to adapt, and we'll likely see a lot more desktop-like apps for the iPad as a result. Mouse support for the iPad is a significant game-changer, and the iPad has now moved well beyond a third category of device for browsing, email, photos, video, music, games, and ebooks.\n\nThat will unnerve Microsoft and its PC partners, but it doesn't mean it's an immediate death sentence for the PC just yet. Just as it has taken Apple 10 years to get to this point on the hardware and software sides, there will be many years ahead of experimentation from app developers to adjust to mouse support in iPadOS. Windows and macOS won't stand still, either, and they're still far more powerful for multitasking and running complicated desktop apps.\n\nApple has painted a line in the sand here, though. The iPad is changing rapidly, even if Apple's new iPad tagline is \"your next computer is not a computer.\" The next 10 years will truly define exactly what kind of computer Apple wants the iPad to be.","131":"Apple to live stream 'One World: Together At Home' virtual concert in benefit of COVID-19 - 9to5Mac The World Health Organization and Global Citizen have announced the \"One World: Together At Home\" virtual benefit concert for COVID-19 relief efforts.

You can expect some new features in this month's April Android 10 upgrade along with several security patches. Here's what you need to know, what changed, and how to get it right now.\n\nAs usual, this software delivers some important changes and fixes for the latest Pixel 2, 2XL, Pixel 3, 3XL, Pixel 3a and Pixel 4. Some of those include improved BT and camera performance, and the \"Requires eyes to be open\" to use the Pixel 4 FaceID feature.\n\nThis week your Pixel phone will get a new update with the latest, greatest, fastest and most secure version of Android 10 available in 2020. Well, as long as you have a Pixel 2 or newer. Those with the original Pixel are no longer getting updates and should consider upgrading to the affordable Pixel 3a or wait for the new Pixel 4a.\n\nGoogle releases new updates on the first Monday of every month, which delivers improved security and patches, bug fixes, and other things. As usual, you should get it right away today or within the net 24-48 hours.\n\nRecently we've started to see a change where Google doesn't mention what's new, or what they changed. However, after a little digging, we were able to find a small changelog that mentions some important fixes, especially for Pixel 4 owners. Below we've added the changelog and bug fixes from Google, but you can also read more at the Android security bulletin, and the Pixel security bulletin page.\n\nThis is a small list of changes and we aren't getting much for new features, which is much different than the massive March update last month. Still, Google continues to improve the experience as they likely work towards releasing Android 11 later this year.\n\nFurthermore, we're seeing several \"critical or high\" patches by Google in April, which will make Android 10 more secure.\n\nYou can expect this update sometime within the next few days, but sometimes we do see long delays with select users. So, If you'd like to get this newest version of Android for your Pixel device now, instead of waiting, you can download or flash the update with these files found below.\n\nIf you do manually download the files, here's how to update your Pixel device.\n\nConsidering there are a few improvements to Bluetooth and keyboard lag, plus security enhancements, you probably want to get this update right away. We expect an over-the-air update notification today, tomorrow or soon. So while this should arrive immediately, don't be surprised if you have to wait for more than a few days or until the weekend. Sometimes we've seen these take 1-2 weeks to arrive.\n\nKeep in mind that Google's check for updates button should work in the settings menu on your phone. Simply go to Settings > System > System Update > Check for Updates to get it right now. This button pulls the update from Google's servers to your phone.\n\nThe entire process should take less than 10 minutes. From downloading to installing and rebooting on Android 10.\n\nWe're seeing a lot of people on social media who've already received the April update, myself included, and so far it's going smooth. That said, we typically see complaints about installation problems, freezing, and bad battery life after any update. It's best to wait for the over the air update, rather than manually install the files, as that's usually the easiest and problem-free way to do it.\n\nSo while Google did release the images for people to manually install it, just have patience, and wait for the over-the-air update which is a much easier process. As a reminder, you need more than 30% battery for the update, and WiFi is recommended. We suggest doing the update tonight or tomorrow at home, not at work when you don't have time to deal with any potential problems. If you do run into issues, here are some common fixes.\n\nUnfortunately, we're not seeing any major changes to the Pixel 2 here, which still has several issues users continue to complain about. Maybe it's time you start thinking about getting a Pixel 3a XL or maybe the new Galaxy S20.\n\nWe've seen a lot of changes come to almost every major Pixel phone over the last several monthly patches and updates. Google continues to offer excellent service for its devices. However, Android 10 introduced a few new issues even after a long 6-month beta period, and not all of those have been fixed, not to mention the March Android 10 update broke Google Pay for some people.\n\nGoogle is still working out a few kinks, and we're glad to see this April update address some of those.\n\nExpect the overall Android experience to continue improving all while Google works to fix bugs and tweak the software for the best performance each and every month. Don't expect Android 10.1 anytime soon, or at all. For now, just expect an update this week, and another on the first Monday of the month each month moving forward.\n\nSo what's actually next for your Pixel phone? Aside from monthly updates, that's the Android 11 Developer Preview that just started and new versions of Android 11 sometime later this month once the dev preview switches into a public beta. The search giant kicked off the Android R developer preview early this year, but the first stable versions won't arrive for another few months.\n\nYou can try Android 11 right now if you dare, but we recommend waiting until at least the 3rd beta. The 2nd release still has more than a few problems and isn't ready for primetime.\n\nFor now, get the latest Android 10 software for your Pixel. Then, leave us a comment below if it fixes your problems, or causes a new one. Also, don't forget that this update is only for Google's own smartphones, and not something like the Galaxy S20. Other phones from OnePlus, Samsung, LG, or others are waiting for updates from the makers.

He was fired the following month.\n\nA 100-page decision issued March 12 by arbitrator Joseph L. Daly ordered Serafin reinstated by April 1 without back pay. Eden Prairie issued a statement saying it received notice Monday and was reviewing the award and had made no decisions on whether to appeal.\n\nSerafin's lawyer, Isaac Kaufman of the Law Enforcement Labor Services union, said his client is \"very pleased\" with the decision. But it's unclear what happens next. Eden Prairie can appeal the decision to the state Supreme Court, reinstate Serafin or negotiate a settlement.\n\nIn November 2018, the Hennepin County Attorney's Office announced problems with a search warrant affidavit from Serafin from March of that year in a heroin case that led to drug and murder charges against Timothy Holmes.\n\nProsecutors said Serafin had a search warrant for Holmes' house, where drugs were found, but he didn't appear to have a warrant to search the car where additional drugs and a gun were uncovered.\n\nA week after making the search, Serafin produced a second warrant application that covered both the house and car, prosecutors said. When asked under oath in court about the two applications, Serafin blamed clerical confusion during a hectic time at work.\n\nUltimately, the Hennepin County prosecutor dismissed charges against Holmes, dropped pending charges against others and opened investigations into former cases handled by the detective. At the time, then-Chief Assistant Hennepin County Attorney David Brown called Serafin's actions \"devastating,\" saying they eroded public trust.\n\nIn firing Serafin, Eden Prairie determined that because he falsified a warrant and lied under oath, he could no longer testify in future cases. Because testifying in court is essential to police work, Serafin couldn't do his job, the city argued in its termination decision. The union then filed the grievance on his behalf.\n\nIn the opinion, Daly unequivocally endorsed Serafin's return to work and erasure of a stain from his career, going to so far as to say the value of his service could not be overstated and calling him one of the state's top drug investigators.\n\n\"His entire professional experience as a police officer, his hard work, his training, the very high opinion that his fellow officers hold of him, and his testimony show he is highly credible and capable,\" Daly wrote.\n\nThe arbitrator said he heard \"five days of intense testimony\" and received two extensive post-hearing briefs and responses before determining that Eden Prairie didn't provide \"clear and convincing evidence that just cause exists to terminate\" Serafin.\n\nThe key question Daly said he faced was whether Serafin knowingly changed the search warrant to include the outbuilding and vehicle after the search, or just replaced a page that was lost.\n\nDaly determined the page was lost. When Serafin went to create a replacement, he inadvertently pulled down the wrong cover page from his computer files. He didn't recognize the mistake for months.\n\nSerafin was a \"credible witness\" who passed a polygraph test and had made the mistake of \"failing to 'X out' a box from a drop-down menu on the application page of the packet for a search warrant,\" Daly wrote.\n\nThe officer then failed to recognize his \"simple human mistake\" until a \"series of dreadful consequences occurred.\"\n\n\"He did not lie, he did not falsify, and he credibly testified at the arbitration hearing,\" Daly wrote.\n\nDaly said he had no authority to tell Eden Prairie or county prosecutors what to do, but said Serafin has faced a \"grave injustice\" by being classified as not credible to testify.\n\n\"I would hope that Officer Serafin would have an opportunity to continue his work as a skilled and respected police officer in the City of Eden Prairie or in some other city he chooses to work,\" Daly wrote.\n\nDaly didn't award back pay to Serafin because his \"mistake caused no end of problems for himself,\" the city, Hennepin and Ramsey County prosecutors and Minnesota citizens.\n\nHe added that Serafin's error came amid a nine-day stretch of work on up to 20 drug cases, capped by working 17 hours straight on the eve of a training trip to Camp Ripley, planning a wedding anniversary trip, and an injury to his young daughter that resulted in her hospitalization.\n\n\"It likely came about because of the chaos he was facing for two days in a row,\" Daly wrote. \"Yet, just as a doctor who makes a mistake during a chaotic day, albeit unintentional mistake, must still face the consequences.\"\n\nAs a result of Serafin's search in the initial case, Holmes was charged with first-degree drug sale and third-degree murder related to the overdose death of a person to whom Holmes was alleged to have sold heroin.\n\nIn March 2018, Holmes pleaded guilty to the first-degree drug sale charge. As part of the plea, Hennepin County Judge Fred Karasov dropped the third-degree murder charge in the death of Margaret \"Maggie\" Lane.\n\nHolmes was sentenced to six years in prison but has since been released.\n\nSerafin started with the department in October 2000. His last day was Nov. 6, 2018. He earned an annual salary of $92,289. He was once named the department's officer of the year.\n\nMcLeod County Attorney Michael Junge reviewed the case and determined that no criminal charges would be filed. Serafin didn't commit perjury even though he lied in court under oath, Junge said. His false statement wasn't \"material\" because it had no effect on the search warrant and its execution.","134":"Are Photos Living Entities? | Fstoppers A photo is taken in an instant, snapped as you perceive the moment, recording indefinitely the raw values encoded from the sensor to the memory card. How then can a photo be a living entity?\n\nA photo begins with an idea. You perceive something in your mind's eye, envision it as it might be, and then let that seed grow and flourish from the original idea in to something more, something greater. That nurturing stage can be quite involved -- \"The Usual Suspects\" by David Yarrow is a stunning (and complex) piece of story telling that must have taken some considerable arranging. It's a real bar, real people, and, err yes, a real wolf!\n\nNurturing can also be quite brief. Gary Winogrand was renowned for the huge volumes of images he shot, a camera constantly at his side. In fact, after his death he purportedly left 2,500 rolls of undeveloped film, 6,500 rolls of developed film, and 3,000 rolls made in to contact sheets. For someone so prolific, I'm fairly sure that there wasn't a great deal of time spent developing his ideas for individual photos.\n\nNurturing often sits somewhere in between the brief and extended examples highlighted above and this is something most of us can identify with. I have to admit I'm quite a fan of Edward Weston's Pepper Number 30. It is a masterclass of form, lighting, and printing. As the name suggests, it wasn't the first pepper image Weston captured. He clearly found the shape and sheen appealing, which, along with lighting and backdrop, made for his setup. At which point he produced a continual stream of shots, varying the peppers he used up to Pepper 37. Kim Weston outlines (NSFW) how Pepper Number 30 was shot at f\/240 for 4-6 hours. In my homage to Weston, I took over 20 images to get to my favorite but clearly I need a better supply of peppers amongst other things!\n\nHomage to Weston\n\nThink about one of your images that you've developed from concept to final product. It might be a star trail that required the scouting of a coastal location before waiting for the right combination of weather and night sky. This might have necessitated several fruitless night starts before everything came together for the three hundred or so shots that were subsequently stacked in post-production.\n\nOr maybe it was a highly abstract street shot that combined the angular elements, Salgado style, of a subway entrance in deep shadow just awaiting a lone figure to stray into the scene. The combination of low sun, clear skies, and a quiet street meaning visit after visit.\n\nI believe photographs become living entities, that transcend the individual pixels they are compose of. They reflect the ideas infused in them by the whole production team, from concept, to shoot, to post-production, representing hours of work, and potentially multiple images. They grow from the birth of the original concept, through a childhood of development where they become self-aware of their own identity before maturity takes hold, and allows their full purpose to be exposed for all to see.\n\nExpanding this idea of concept-to-product, the final output doesn't have to be an image, but could include a series of images -- a portfolio. It's the portfolio that we most often see turned in to a photobook, such as Nick Turpin's \"On the Night Bus\" which saw him spend two years, in all weathers, sniping shots of people on buses from the urban jungle of Elephant and Castle in London. Conceptually the images are repeated in new and different ways throughout the book, becoming almost hypnotic in the way that they metamorphose in refreshing and unending variations. Like a colorful serpent writhing from page to page as it seethes in anger, the images trying to escape the leaves of the book, to free themselves from the constrictions of a paper-flat world.\n\nImages -- photographs -- deserve far more on a number of levels. Firstly, they deserve more at the stage of conception. You may not be planning months ahead for your next conceptual shoot involving a large support crew, but every photo deserves to born for a purpose, to be created with intent. Every time you press the shutter button, do so knowing that there is a reason for capturing the next image. Secondly, let it have the longevity to grow beyond infantile youth. Let its purpose, message, and core values live beyond it's immediate future. It deserves to have a future to grow in to, one that allows it to communicate with others and convey it's message. Finally, it deserves to live beyond the constrictions of a short-lived social media future, where its two minute blaze of glory then sees it consigned to a facial recognition bot before sitting on your timeline. It's so much better to have a fully rounded, long lived life, than to go out in a blaze of glory. Let it escape the bonds of your hard disk, from its digital imprisonment, to a long lasting analogue future.\n\nBreathe life into your photos, cherish and nurture them, let them grow in to the artworks they deserve to be. In short, display your art. Let them live on in physical form. I asked this question recently to see if readers had printed and displayed their work. Of the 500 votes, encouragingly only 11% said they didn't display their own work. Of the remainder, a whopping 56% displayed artistic work, with family portraits trailing in second place at 22%. That's a great result and readers posted examples of how their work is displayed.\n\nPrinting is one step in the right direction, but you don't have to go far to find wallets of photos that don't see the light of day. So, in addition to printing your images, you need to make the conscious effort to display them. Like many, I go through the process of putting together an annual portfolio which can be a painful process. I normally start out with around one hundred images and then have to whittle them down to my top 24 before meticulously printing them as a photobook. However, I don't then do the final stage -- displaying them. I need to breathe new life in to these 24 images and let them find a place on my walls. I can't show them all, but some should be permanent fixtures, whilst others should rotate through display allowing them to find a home but also to provide a varied backdrop to where I live.\n\nSo actually, maybe it's not only the photo itself that is the living entity, but also the space it inhabits -- the display space itself. Let your images live on and, in so doing, create a dynamic display in your home.\n\nLead image courtesy of 024-657-834, used under Creative Commons via Pixabay.

What does it do to our reception of photography?\n\nTimes Are Changing\n\nFstoppers co-founder Patrick Hall has recently released a video about the new Skylum Software Luminar 4.2. While I was amazed by the possibilities it offers, it also made me scared a little bit. This software doesn't only make it easy to replace your sky with dramatic clouds, vibrant sunsets, or whatever you like. It also adds cool stuff like giraffes, birds, a giant moon, or fireworks wherever you want them to be. Everything happens with a few simple clicks -- almost too easy to be true.\n\nYet, it's all true and available. It works amazingly efficiently, and I guess the times of masking out trees, buildings, and people will soon be over. Is that a good thing? On the one hand, I'm a little resentful. Hours of learning how to use different blending modes, masks, and paths (I hate paths) for nothing? Well, technology is always changing, and I've got to deal with it. If you don't keep up with the times, you'll fall behind.\n\nWhat drives me crazy, though, are the possibilities that new technologies offer to a broad group of people and how it has the power to degrade the efforts of photography itself. I won't point a finger at anyone, because I'm guilty, too. Trying to squeeze out every little detail in my images also means pushing the boundaries a little more. It shifts the focus from taking a photograph to post-processing it. When these skills become accessible to everyone, we run the danger of witnessing more and more photographs becoming more and more edited. What does it mean for us as photographers?\n\nNo Acknowledgement of Our Efforts\n\nAltering an image is quite easy today, and software engineers still haven't met the end of possibilities. Probably, they never will. I find it quite probable that in the (not too distant) future, we'll only need to tell our software \"create an image of a beautiful lake with a building in the middle of it,\" and within seconds, we'll get a perfect image. We can ask the software to add some birds (already possible within seconds in Luminar) to make the image look even more fantastic.\n\nNot a composite, but patiently waited (and flushed the birds).\n\nBut what will photography become? Just imagine you captured a stunning image and you're proud of it, only until you realize that no one else is. Planning a shot and waiting until the birds fly into the frame is a lot of effort that one can be proud of. It's an original idea, and you had to get to the place and make things work.\n\nEven today, your 12-year-old daughter can take a snapshot, shove it through a few apps, and add the birds with not much more effort. She doesn't need to wait and work to make her ideas become a photograph. Many ideas can easily be implemented in software. Far worse: you put some effort into creating the picture and made it possible in reality, while others simply make their ideas possible in virtual reality.\n\nMaybe the following situation has happened to you as well: You took a photograph that you find outstanding. After making basic adjustments, you show it to your friends or family. \"But that's Photoshopped, right\" is a frequently asked question in this situation. \"No, it's Lightroom\" won't be a sufficient answer. Feeling the need to justify yourself, you start your lecture on the process of developing a picture: \"Well you know, there is a little difference between altering the image or simply developing it, the camera itself has a sensor...\" and so forth -- the magic is gone. All this is already a reality today.\n\nIs pushing the sensor's capabilities beyond what you can see already altering?\n\nWhat We're Going to Miss\n\nFor commercial photographers, new technologies are often a blessing, of course. We could discuss if it was right to advertise things by detaching them from reality, but I do believe that most people know that commercials are made to sell, not to critically reflect. Losing a lot of money because it simply wasn't the best weather to photograph real estate is no option for the client; losing too much time editing because of the weather is not an option for the photographer. Smart solutions keep the business up to date.\n\nIn other areas, especially if you only use photography as a hobby, the situation is worse. I find landscape photography a great way to spend time outside. The mere process of shooting a landscape is one of the rewards I get from this hobby. It's a relaxing activity, good for physical and mental health. On the other hand, I also love to share the images and get positive feedback. I guess everyone loves their skills and effort to be acknowledged by others.\n\nA few years back, when I started taking photography a little more seriously, I went out to shoot the Milky Way at a very special location. I published the image in a photography group, only to find someone posting the same scene two days later as a composite.\n\nA little too cooked, but at least an original?\n\nWhom does it harm more? Me, who went through an exciting process to capture a great scene in less-than-medium image quality? Or him, who never left his desk to make his (stolen) vision become true? I don't know, but I guess we're both losers of a competitive game. I got hurt because my original idea could be reproduced in much better quality, while no amateur would recognize the shortcut. On the other hand, he, who never went out on an amazing adventure, missed the thrill of wild camping in the cold, has never eagerly waited for the right moment, and never felt the adrenaline pumping through his body at 4:30 AM when the clouds finally cleared the view.\n\nSloth Is the Beginning of Vice\n\nEveryone is his or her own master and can decide how he or she lives a creative life. On the other hand, I do believe that sometimes, technology is too seductive. It makes us lazy, and we ignore what we might miss. Like a drug, technology can give us an immediate result, but it also makes us numb to enjoying the alternatives.\n\nIt's ancient knowledge: The route is the goal. While the final product is an achievement, we shouldn't forget how much value we can create in the process itself. We can easily mix the two up and stop caring for the process, because you could achieve a better result with less effort.\n\nHow many times did I get up this mountain hours before sunrise until I found fluffy clouds in the sky? Yet, I'd do it all again. It even made the final image more valuable to me.\n\nMoreover, the possibility to make our concepts become reality by just clicking with our mouse puts us under competitive pressure. But what can we do against it? Is censorship the answer? Do we need laws that obligate us to mark edited images? Not only to prevent fake news and information, but also to help ourselves enjoy the process of taking images? Is this an overreaction or maybe the last chance to save us from completely mixing up the real and virtual space?\n\nAnother ancient (German) saying is: Sloth is the beginning of vice. Sometimes. we don't see that we're on the wrong path until it's too late.","136":"Are high streets closing for business? Not on our watch, say traders Are you a super-organised festive shopper with presents wrapped and ready in November, or will you be searching for gifts at 8pm on Christmas Eve? If the former rings true, you might opt to buy online, where there are endless options for even the most picky relative and free returns are largely standard.\n\nWhile convenient, the growth of online shopping is one of the factors contributing to the closure of high street shops. According to a survey by accountancy firm PwC, there was a net closure of 987 stores in 2014 (5,839 shops shut down and 4,852 opened) compared with 371 in 2013.\n\nHowever, there is reason to feel positive - across the UK there are pockets where independent high street businesses are thriving and remain a favourite with locals and tourists alike. Successful initiatives including Small Business Saturday and the Great British High Streets Awards, run by the Future High Streets Forum, also support small businesses on the high street.\n\nIn the runup to Small Business Saturday on 5 December, a Small Business Saturday bus is touring towns and cities across the UK. On Tuesday 24 November it stops in Winchester. Catherine Turness, executive director of Winchester Business Improvement District (BID), says the visit will include 12 free advice sessions on the bus, many hosted by local businesses and covering topics from how to write effective website copy to a school for social entrepreneurs.\n\nShe says there are several business networks in the area. \"Independent businesses here have their own [community] groups by area, including The Square and Kingsgate. They get together once month.\"\n\nKingsgate Wines and Provisions, which has been in the city for 20 years, is in the Kingsgate community group. Shop manager Tim Pride says: \"It's a tight-knit group of businesses and we organise things together.\" The group's Christmas tree lights are going to be switched on soon, and the nearby church and other businesses are getting involved, with carol singing and mulled wine on offer to shoppers.\n\nThe Christmas market by Winchester Cathedral, one of city's main tourist attractions, will run from 19 November to 22 December this year and will offer shoppers the chance to buy from small businesses.\n\nCaf\u00e9 Monde, located in the Square, has been in Winchester for 13 years and takes part in regular community meetings with about 20 other businesses in the area. Holly Richardson, cafe supervisor and daughter of owner Phil Simmonds, says businesses in the Square help each other out, borrowing equipment from each other, for example. Caf\u00e9 Monde even takes food orders to customers at the nearby hairdresser. \"We're a small family-run business and we pride ourselves on friendly service,\" says Richardson.\n\nThe city has become busier in the past few years, according to Richardson, helped by events such as the Christmas market and the Hat Fair, an annual and longstanding celebration of theatre, dance and circus skills.\n\nSmall Business Saturday profiles 100 small businesses across the country in the runup to the event. This includes businesses in Glasgow, which has a range of independent shops and boutiques. Among those in the Small Biz 100 are Glasgow-based Locavore and Rup & Forn's Love Letters.\n\nWear Eponymous, a clothing boutique and online store in Glasgow, is looking forward to 5 December. Elaine Burns, creative director and co-founder of the store, says: \"We love Small Business Saturday and have just signed up with Love From Indie Street, a great initiative encouraging high street shoppers to think outside the usual chain stores.\"\n\nBurns says there's a good business community in the city. \"Even if a company could be considered a competitor we tend to stick together and help each other out - be it with useful contacts, social media support or chatting at business events.\"\n\nJim Duffy, CEO of business accelerator Entrepreneurial Spark, which has a base in Glasgow, says: \"Over the past few years we've seen an increase in small businesses emerging, alongside a growing consumer trend to shop local or shop independent.\" He adds that independent business should work together \"to make sure that they know what the customer wants and offer the customer a different experience to that of a chain store\".\n\nSandy McClean, owner and manager of vinyl store Love Music, which has been trading in Glasgow since 1996, says: \"It tends to be people [from other businesses] on your doorstep that support one another.\"\n\nHe adds: \"We've noticed that we have a smaller amount of customers [than a big retailer] but for each we have a bigger sale. So we might not get a customer for an hour, then someone comes in and buys three records.\"\n\nDuffy says a number of initiatives are available to small businesses in the city, including Entrepreneurial Spark, the Glasgow New Business Fund, which offers businesses part funding for their premises over a four-year period, the West of Scotland Loan Fund, Business Gateway and Scottish Enterprise.\n\nIn Leeds, Entrepreneurial Spark and NatWest are backing a six-month accelerator programme in the city, which is offering support and mentors to 75 businesses.\n\nRachel Hannan, an angel investor based in Leeds, says: \"I see an increasing appetite to back small businesses. It's also positive that there is an increasing range of places to go for funding, although it can be difficult for small businesses to navigate them all.\"\n\nShe adds that shopping in Leeds has been revitalised recently. The opening of Trinity Shopping Centre in March 2013 pulled together a number of tired arcades.\n\nClaire Riley, co-founder of Our Handmade Collective, a gift shop based in The Grand Arcade in Leeds, says there is a good sense of camaraderie among independent business owners. \"We're all working towards the same goal, to make a living from something we love, and this gives us a passion which (in my opinion) isn't often found within bigger businesses. Most of us realise that a lot of little voices together shout louder than one large voice.\"\n\nShe adds that there are support networks for local business owners to become part of, such as Independent Leeds, Leeds Love Affair and Leeds Living.\n\nMeanwhile, in the north of the city, Harriet Vaight, proprietor of design shop Chirpy, says: \"Independents in the suburbs of Leeds are thriving ... The city centre is a slightly different story - with higher rents, some independents have struggled. But there are still a lot of high quality independent shops with a strong fan base.\"\n\nOn Small Business Saturday, Chirpy will be giving away prizes in a lucky dip as well as holding a prize draw for a \u00a3100 shopping spree in the store.\n\nBut the day is just part of wider encouragement in the city for small businesses. Vaight says: \"Since we all know and understand the challenges that we face as an independent business, we do our best to advocate each other as best we can.\"\n\nSign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.","137":"Are the Twins really this bad? I wrote in my last post that the Twins aren't as bad as they played in Detroit and I'll update that by saying they're not as bad as they have played so far, even with Monday's astoundingly atrocious loss in the home opener.\n\nThey simply can't be that bad because if they were six-games-out-of-seven loss bad, the Twins would finish the season with 139 losses. Even if things don't improve much, chances are they won't lose many more than 100.\n\nThe list of troubles so far in the first week is pretty amazing, all the more because some of them directly relate to areas that were in such need of improvement coming into 2015:\n\n*The bullpen is a mess. The combination of who was retained and who was picked up hasn't quite worked. Mrs. 219 has already paraphrased the movie 'Pretty in Pink' when she sees Blaine Boyer make an appearance: \"Blaine? That's a major appliance. That's not a pitcher!\" That's what you say about a guy who has (a) pitched for six teams in his last five major league seasons, not including a two-year sabbatical from the majors; (b) put 12 men on base while getting nine outs in four appearances.\n\n*On the bullpen, it's reasonable for Manager Paul Molitor to expect relievers to pitch more than one inning. I'm not convinced of the wisdom to let Tim Stauffer come out for a third inning, which was the start of Monday's eighth-inning bullpen meltdown. It's tough enough for a pitcher to inherit a tough situation with runners on base. It's even tougher with the pitchers Molitor has to work with.\n\n*Speaking of Molitor, a couple of first-week moves left me queasy. One came on Sunday when he chose to bring in Boyer, after three poor outings, in the bottom of the eighth when the Twins were trailing only 3-2 in Chicago. Two singles and a home run later, it was 6-2. On Saturday, letting the overmatched Jordan Schafer and Shane Robinson bat (and take called third strikes) in the top of the ninth (in a one-run game) against White Sox closer David Robertson was close to a concession statement, all the more with Kurt Suzuki and Eduardo Nunez were on the bench.\n\nYes it would have taken some realignment in the bottom of the ninth if the Twins had scored (Danny Santana to center field, Nunez to shortstop, Chris Herrmann from catcher to left field and Suzuki behind the plate), but letting them both bat was ugly.\n\n*Speaking of ugly, there's no way you can reassure me about the Twins outfield defense. Good plays need to be made. But so far there have been bad routes, misplays on balls that would have been caught by better outfielders (Think those employed by Kansas City Royals) and the ultimate lowlight of Torii Hunter's bouncing, rolling throw-to-nobody on Monday that looked like his hand had been pricked by brambles attached to the ball when he finally retrieved Lorenzo Cain's double.\n\nYou didn't need advanced defensive metrics to know the Twins were going to struggle with outfield defense. But pretending that everything was going to be all right was a spring training disservice.\n\n*The dropping Eduardos. Nunez dropping a fly ball on Sunday followed by Escobar dropping a pop-up didn't result in the White Sox scoring in the second inning. But it meant that Phil Hughes needed to throw extra pitches, which likely made for an earlier exit for the staff ace. Giving away outs is always an issue.\n\n*We could spend a lot of time on the lineup. I won't, beyond saying the Twins would stand a better chance of winning right now if Santana went back to center field and Escobar was the first-call shortstop.. Santana, who booted a grounder during Monday's troubled eighth, would be set back in his development at shortstop. But keeping him there with the current roster has a Timberwolves-like tinge to it.\n\nAnd if Joe Mauer's close-to-.400 on-base percentage is going to be fed by singles and walks, let's get him batting second and Brian Dozier third, OK?\n\nAnd while I'm managing from my keyboard, let's skip the fifth starter this time through and let Hughes start on four days rest Friday instead of Mike Pelfrey. The logic is simple: I'm going to the game that night.","138":"Are we watching the Twins you were afraid of seeing? Now that the Twins streak of subpar baseball is coming close to the two-week mark, I'm getting asked about whether the team is going to play for the rest of the season the way we were expecting from Day One (and after that weak 1-6 Week One). The week before last -- the split in Boston and the bad weekend against Milwaukee -- could be passed off as an anomaly. As recently as Monday, after all, the ESPN \"power rankings\" had the Twins as the fifth best team in baseball.\n\nLook at the lessons of the last couple of games and you'll see what astute people were saying all along: The Twins, as currently constructed, are a team with a small margin for error. On offense, the list of players we thought were significant who haven't performed expected is long: Mauer, Suzuki, Escobar and Vargas on the current roster; Santana and Arcia who have been sent to the minors for repairs. Hunter and Plouffe have slumped lately to their 2014 levels on offense.\n\nBrian Dozier is the only player who has improved his production from 2014.\n\nWithout turning this into a screed about Joe Mauer, let's get this on the table so we can move on: Among the 24 MLB first basemen with enough plate appearances to qualify among league leaders, Mauer is 23rd in slugging percentage, on base-plus-slugging percentage and extra-base hits. He is 16 in on-base percentage and tied for 13 in RBI. (The best recent in-depth analysis on Mauer is from Aaron Gleeman, who writes: \"He's hitting worse than ever at a position with the highest bar offensively.\" The rest is here and a should-read.)\n\nAll of this is happening while Mauer is batting third much more often than not. Given the current construction and production of the Twins, manager Paul Molitor doesn't have many choices. He is pretty much stuck building a lineup in which he hopes the first few guys can get on base and then something good happens from the bottom guys in the order. Part science, part magic.\n\nDozier is batting leadoff, as much as anything, to get the Twins' mostly highly productive player to the plate as many times as possible.\n\nThose offensive issues are manageable, as they say in geometry, if and only if...\n\n*Your defense doesn't self-destruct. You can load the bases with nobody out and score one run and have Tommy Milone throw one bad pitch and play meet-the-bullpen if Aaron Hicks, who has saved the Twins with his defense a few times in the last month, doesn't miss that fly ball in the eighth inning on Friday. If Hicks makes the catch, the Twins score and Glen Perkins gets the save, you can file away all of the bad stuff as bumps in the road that a good team conquers. Wednesday's loss to Kansas City became lopsided in part, because of poor plays by Torii Hunter (a wretched throw) and Joe Mauer (a wrong throwing decision on a ground ball.) Mauer's mistake was one in a series of recent defensive misplays on his part that should earn him an extended refresher on first-base fundamentals. (Paging Tom Kelly.)\n\n*Your bullpen is first rate. Tim Stauffer is gone, but Aaron Thompson has replaced him on the unreliable arms list and Michael Tonkin, Stauffer's roster replacement, has done little impressive work. The bullpen needs to be as good as it was in May, otherwise we'll be seeing Perkins more often on Twitter (where he's also an All-Star) than on the mound.\n\n*Your starting pitching remains solid: Twins starting pitchers have the fourth-best ERA in the American League. Play around with the splits in just about any other significant category and the Twins are in the bottom half. The lack of strikeouts becomes more alarming when the defense breaks down. That's been a seasons-long issue, but other numbers related to the pitching have frayed in recent weeks. If the starting pitching suffers, that's big trouble.\n\n*Your head is on straight. A four-game losing streak (and even a couple of weeks of blight) isn't reason for fans to hyperventilate - or Hunter to make the spectacle of himself that he made in Wednesday's loss. Yes, he was called out on strikes by an umpire with a bad reputation behind the plate. Yes, I would have understood if he'd said something to get ejected. Yes, a veteran player with star credentials has some leeway to do things that younger and less accomplished players don't have. But that was just silly and inappropriate - and I felt a bit embarrassed for Hunter when I watched it. It was more WWE than UFC.\n\nSo here's what's up. There's good reason to wonder which side of .500 the Twins will be on when June ends. I know the Twins aren't as good as the Royals (a team whose bullpen and defense make up for other shortcomings) and despite the current standings they're not as good as the Tigers (a team whose shortcomings still need conquering).\n\nThe Twins did things in May that would be impossible to replicate over a six-month stretch. The issue is whether they can find a point closer to where they were last month than where they are right now to remain interesting.","139":"Arizona governor signs small school voucher expansion bill Arizona governor signs small school voucher expansion bill March 23, 2020 Printer-Friendly Email Article Reprints Comments\n\nPHOENIX (AP) -- Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey has signed legislation that would slightly increase the reach of the state's current school voucher program and revamp how it is administered.\n\nThe proposal was billed as a permanent fix to an issue that cropped up last year when the new state schools chief discovered that a handful of children on the Navajo Nation were illegally using vouchers to attend a private school in New Mexico.\n\nBut Democrats said this year's measure is far more broad than a temporary fix passed last year. That proposal just allowed seven children attending the Hilltop Christian School to continue going there this school year.\n\nRepublican backers of the bill said it merely made permanent last year's action.\n\nBut the new law allows any child living on a reservation to attend a private school within 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) of the Arizona border using state funds. That means more students could attend the Hilltop Christian School in Tse Bonito, New Mexico, across the border from Window Rock.\n\nAnd there's no prohibition on other schools opening along the border to use Arizona vouchers.\n\nDucey, a Republican, signed the bill Friday without comment.\n\nThe bill also removes some oversight from the Department of Education, now run by a Democrat, and sets up a dedicated call center for parents in the program. It also sets up dedicated funding for administration and bars parents from moving voucher money to college savings accounts.\n\nArizona's school vouchers, technically called Empowerment Scholarship Accounts, allow parents to use state funds to send their children to private schools or pay for other education costs.\n\nThe program only applied to students with disabilities when it began in 2011 but has been greatly expanded over the years to cover many others. It currently is capped at about 30,000 students, although only about 8,200 students are now enrolled. The current cost is about $110 million a year.\n\nParents get 90% of the state funds that normally go to their local public school to use for private school tuition and other education costs. Disabled students can receive up to $40,000 for specialized therapy.\n\nA 2017 law repealed by voters the following year would have allowed all 1.1 million Arizona schoolchildren to apply for private school vouchers, but put a cap on enrollment. The repeal didn't block future expansions.\n\nA new citizen's initiative being circulated by voucher opponents Save Our Schools Arizona would limit the program to 1% of the state's school population per year, or about 11,000 students. It will be on the November ballot if enough signatures are collected.\n\nCopyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The four Lynx stars who won four titles with the team left, one by one, for wildly different reasons on paths as divergent as bicycle spokes, leaving their former team facing a forced march from stability to chaos.\n\nThe Lynx are facing their most unusual winter, leaving them with few guards and declining expectations, while the WNBA bolsters the league's rising popularity with its most dramatic offseason.\n\nThe Lynx may never be quite the same, unless they can navigate the WNBA's new promising-yet-perilous landscape.\n\nThe league's growing pains are gnawing at Lynx fans. The WNBA is enjoying its first winter of true, mind-bending, roster-altering free agency, creating a handful of seeming superteams. The superteam of the last decade suddenly finds itself down to one ring-wearing star.\n\nSeimone Augustus was the first of the four Lynx OGs -- their original greats. Chosen with the first pick in 2006, when the Lynx were as irrelevant in Minnesota as shark repellent, Augustus played 14 seasons with Target Center as her home, helping the franchise grow from afterthought to four-time champion.\n\nShe became the last of the four to depart on Thursday, signing with the archrival Los Angeles Sparks.\n\nThis is what a more popular and fluid WNBA looks like -- like other major sports, where fan loyalty is constantly tested by heartache, and popularity is driven by player movement and the rampant speculation surrounding every possibility.\n\nAll of which leaves the Lynx trying to rebuild, reload and recalibrate on the fly.\n\nMaya Moore left to campaign for prison reform.\n\nRebekkah Brunson, the only WNBA player to win five championships, retired after dealing with the effects of concussions, and recently joined the Lynx staff as an assistant coach.\n\nLindsay Whalen, the two-time Olympic gold medalist, left to coach the Gophers.\n\nWith Augustus' departure, the Lynx have no one remaining from their first championship team, and only one star remaining from their last championship team -- center Sylvia Fowles.\n\nThe obvious answer to the Lynx's problems is free agency. But the Lynx, like so many other Minnesota sports teams, are finding the market risky.\n\nLynx General Manager and coach Cheryl Reeve has always raved about point guard Kristi Toliver, but Toliver wanted to come to Minnesota only if she could play with DeWanna Bonner.\n\nThe Lynx were interested in Bonner, but not at the price she leveraged from Connecticut in a sign-and-trade. The Sun gave Phoenix three first-round draft picks and signed Bonner to an expensive long-term deal -- believed to be for as long as four years -- at the age of 32.\n\nThe Lynx dynasty was built on first-round picks, trades and a bit of luck. They were bad enough in the 2000s to land Augustus with the first pick in the draft. They dealt for Whalen, got Brunson in a dispersal draft, and selected Moore with the first pick in the draft.\n\nReeve's predicament is that she wants to contend every year but hasn't had a high pick in the draft since 2011, when the Lynx chose Moore. So she's left with Fowles, reigning Rookie of the Year Napheesa Collier, a slew of proven or promising wings and forwards, and no true point guards.\n\nLexi Brown is a shooting guard who could play the position, and Reeve doesn't mind running a modern offense in which the ball handling and passing could become shared tasks.\n\nThe combination of player losses, a decade of success and the rest of the league throwing money and draft picks at available stars has made this a quiet winter for the Lynx, leaving Reeve sounding a lot like every Twins executive ever quoted on the perils of free agency.\n\n\"You could be aggressive and find yourself in trouble,\" Reeve said.\n\nBecause true free agency is new to the WNBA, she has studied the effects of free-agent moves in the NBA, and for every superteam assembled that won a title there are five that break the bank and bust franchises.\n\nAs a champion of women's basketball, Reeve loves the excitement this wild offseason has brought to the WNBA, even if the Lynx, for once, have been little more than spectators.","141":"Asha's naked photos exposed in devastating child abuse ordeal on Corrie Asha Alahan is left devastated when her naked photos are exposed in next week's Coronation Street.\n\nThe traumatised teenager is horrified to discover that a topless video she sent privately has been made public.\n\nDev's daughter, played by Tanisha Gorey, then starts receiving vile trolling in the hard-hitting new child abuse storyline.\n\nAsha's life is turned upside down when she is encouraged to get back with heartthrob Corey by Rick Neelan's daughter, Kelly.\n\nBut jealous Amy also has her eyes on Corey and the former friends become loves rivals.\n\nAmy reveals to Tracy that she has fallen out with Asha over the lad, so she invites them round for pizza and a movie.\n\nBut tensions brews when Asha spots Amy having a laugh with Corey - with Kelly fanning the flames.\n\nAmy hosts at party at No.1 behind her parents' backs but it soon snowballs out of control when gatecrashers arrive.\n\nBefore it all gets out of hand, Asha confides in Amy that she flashed her boobs for Corey on facetime.\n\nMeanwhile, Corey scrolls through the pictures of Asha on his phone then accidentally smashes one of Tracy's new lamps.\n\nFurious Amy thinks Kelly is to blame for the broken lamp and the intruders which starts a heated row.\n\nIn all the commotion, the naked pictures of Asha are sent from Corey's phone to the 'party people' group chat.\n\nAsha quickly becomes aware of nasty bully Pastel-Blue and her nasty friends staring at her.\n\nBut she has no time to address the situation as a furious Dev bursts in and drags drunk Aadi and Asha home.\n\nTracy and Steve throw the revellers out of the house and order Amy to start clearing up after the police arrive.\n\nOver the road, Asha is horrified when she sees all the messages on her phone and sickened to realise her personal photos have gone viral.\n\nDevastated Asha lies on her bed - but will she tell Dev what she is suffering?\n\nSpeaking to the Manchester Evening News, the NSPCC said that Asha's experience is, unfortunately, very common with that of teens across the country.\n\nThe charity was previously consulted over Bethany Platt's grooming storyline and, for the past six months, they have been consulting with senior policy officer Alana Ryan over Asha's story.\n\nShe said: \"We know that a third of all child sexual abuse is perpetrated by peers and this includes non-contact offenses, such as the taking and sharing of sexual images without consent.\n\n\"When working with the team at Coronation Street, we really wanted to ensure young viewers understood that taking and sharing photos without permission is never acceptable.\"\n\n*Coronation Street airs Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays on ITV at 7.30pm","142":"Asian Olympic Qualifiers: Amit Panghal Books Tokyo 2020 Spot, Manish Kaushik In Contention Despite Loss | Boxing News World number one Amit Panghal (52kg) qualified for his maiden Olympic Games, while Manish Kaushik (63kg) remained in the hunt for a Tokyo ticket despite losing his quarterfinal bout in the Asia\/Oceania Qualifiers in Jordan on Monday.

Satish Kumar, Rani, Krishan (69kg), Lovlina Borgohain (69kg) and Ashish Kumar (75kg) became the first set of Indian boxers to qualify for the showpiece scheduled in July-August this year. While fourth-seeded Rani notched up a facile 5-0 win over Thailand's Pornnipa Chutee, Krishan endured a tough one against third-seeded Japanese Sewonrets Okazawa before also prevailing in a unanimous verdict against the Asian silver-medallist. In the evening session, two-time world bronze-winner and second seed Borgohain eased past Uzbekistan's Maftunakhon Melieva to enter the semifinals.\n\nAlso through to the last-four stage was Asian silver-medallist Kumar with a 5-0 win over Indonesia's Maikhel Roberrd Muskita, the bout being tougher than what the final scoreline might suggest.\n\n\"I managed to execute whatever I had planned. I wanted to fight from a distance and counter-attack, which I could do. Just qualifying is not enough, I want to now win a gold medal,\" a jubilant Borgohain, who hails from Assam, said after her bout.\n\nHowever, first-timer Sachin Kumar (81kg) went down in a split decision to China's national champion Daxaing Chen in his quarterfinal bout. But he remains in the hunt for an Olympic berth if he can win the two-bout box-off between the losing quarterfinalists.\n\nThe top five boxers in his category will get a spot in the Tokyo Games. While Rani, Borgohain and Kumar secured their maiden Olympic spots, Krishan will be making his third successive appearance at the quadrennial showpiece, scheduled in July-August.\n\n\"I had never fought against this girl before today and honestly, I was a bit scared. I had told my coaches about it before the bout. They instilled confidence in me and I could pull off a one-sided result. I am happy,\" said the 29-year-old Rani, who fought career-threatening shoulder and hand injuries before her gold at last year's Asian Championships.\n\nRani will next face the reigning world and Asian champion Li Qian of China, who has the top billing in the 75kg category. Qian had no trouble beating Mongolia's Myagmarjargal Munkhbat 5-0 in the opening bout of the day.\n\nTaking full advantage of her longer reach, Rani outpunched the inexperienced but determined Chutee.\n\nThe Indian is a three-time Asian medallist besides being a bronze-winner at the 2014 Asian Games. Krishan, however, had to slog hard against a brilliant boxer, whose performance was eye-catching despite the loss. Okazawa, a gold-winner at the Olympic Test Event last year, kept Krishan on his toes and his right jabs were particularly effective.\n\nWhat worked for the Indian was consistent straight punches to the body, which fetched him the bulk of the points.\n\nAwaiting Krishan in the semifinals is second-seeded Ablaikhan Zhussupov of Kazakhstan, a two-time world bronze-medallist and a former Asian silver-winner. Zhussupov defeated Thailand's Wuttichai Masuk in a unanimous verdict.\n\nKrishan is making a comeback in the amateur fold after taking the professional plunge after the 2016 Rio Olympics. He had an unbeaten run in the circuit before a back injury changed his plans. Upon his return to the amateur boxing last year, he won a gold medal at the South Asian Games in December. Later, Sachin was out-scored by Chen, a taller man who found his range after trailing in the opening round.\n\nUsing his telescopic range, Chen managed to connect some clean straights while Kumar paid dearly for holding back too much after dominating the first round.\n\nIn the evening session, Borgohain and Kumar continued the rampaging run.

He defeated second seed Ablaikhan Zhussupov of Kazakhstan, a two-time world bronze-medallist, in the semifinals on Tuesday.\n\nHe sustained a cut on his left eyelid in the second round of the bout before claiming a split decision victory.\n\nHe, along with seven other Indians, secured a Tokyo Olympics ticket by making the semifinals of the ongoing qualifiers.","150":"Ask Amy: After his scam-sham wedding, friend tries again Dear Amy: Our ostentatious friend is getting married (again) -- for real, this time. His first wedding was an extravagant affair, complete with a destination bachelor party, a destination wedding at a fancy resort, expensive bottles -- the works.\n\nWe gave him a sizable gift on top of our over-the-top travel expenses.\n\nWhen the unhappy couple split up, after three tumultuous years, we discovered they were never married at all!\n\nThese two successful lawyers took a look at their relationship and decided not to file the marriage license. They would say that they were procrastinating, hoping their relationship would improve to a point where marriage would become less risky, but it never got there.\n\nThey certainly blew the 60-day window to file the license, but never returned any gifts.\n\nNow our friend is engaged to a new woman. In true fashion, his bachelor party and wedding will be in fabulous destinations and will demand great expense.\n\nWe plan to give the couple a modest gift.\n\nWe can't help but feel some injustice has been done, though we're not sure what. He never even sent us a gift for our wedding. Is it petty to consider this all in the past?\n\n-- Witness\n\nDear Witness: Your friend's sense of entitlement is ... impressive. However -- if you don't like the way this wedding is structured, you don't have to participate in it. Being invited to an extravaganza does not obligate a person to attend.\n\nI hope you spoke your mind (to him and his \"bride\") when you learned that his previous extravaganza was a scam, and I wonder if you like or respect him enough to continue to have a close relationship with him.\n\nIt must be tempting to punish him for his previous behavior, but it is important to remember that he isn't the only person participating in this wedding. His bride should be presumed innocent (until proven to be equally craven).\n\nIf you attend, a modest gift is called for. If you don't attend, you're off the hook.\n\nDear Amy: My husband and I have been married for almost seven years. He has seven sisters (he is the only male in the family). He has one sister who always has to be the center of attention at family gatherings.\n\nIt's so damn annoying! She always has to bring up the expensive family trips she has planned for the summer, and is always bragging about how good she has it, as if to say, \"Don't you wish your husband was rich like mine?\"\n\nShe acts like a snotty, spoiled teenager.\n\nI would like to scream and tell her to shut up! If I sit down with one of his other sisters, she butts right into our conversation because she's \"assuming\" that I'm talking smack about her.\n\nI go to these gatherings for the sake of my husband and in order for our son to spend time with his cousins.\n\nShould I just sit in a corner and not talk to anyone, so I won't get bitten by the \"poisonous serpent?\"\n\n-- Confused\n\nDear Confused: If your sister-in-law acts like a spoiled teenager, then perhaps you should treat her like one. My preferred technique is to remember that I am the grown-up. Sometimes -- reacting at all is just feeding the serpent.\n\nYou should practice behaving in a way that comes off as mature, detached, and overall neutral. Be aware that your body language can betray tension, and so try not to clench when you encounter her.\n\nIn a family as large as this one, it should be fairly easy to avoid your sister-in-law. You should strive to engage in positive conversations with your other relatives at these gatherings. Never gossip about this in-law with her siblings -- even if they invite you to trash her, the rules of sisterhood dictate that they can criticize her, but you cannot.\n\nDear Amy: \"Stepmom-to-be\" shared her concerns that her future adolescent stepson didn't do some little things around the house, like \"pushing in his chair after dinner.\"\n\nThis made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. Thank you for this line: \"You should ask him to choose ways to contribute, go easy on him when he flakes out, and give him credit when he does well.\"\n\nI got a stepmom when I was his age, and I felt like she only noticed when I messed up!\n\n-- Stepson\n\nDear Stepson: The whole \"step\" relationship is a long game. Yes, positive reinforcement is vital.","151":"Ask Amy: An in-law loan goes bad Dear Readers: Because of syndication scheduling, I write and submit my columns two weeks in advance of publication. Due to this time lag, the Q&A's will not reflect the latest information about the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic we are currently facing.\n\nDear Amy: I have loaned an in-law a significant amount of money. While it is not a lot to some people, it is to us.\n\nWe have given this person well over a year to pay us back. It was decided that if the loan was not paid back within a year, there would be interest charged.\n\nIf the loan date extended later (like a year beyond that), the interest would be increased.\n\nI decided about three months ago to email them. I got no response. Since then I have emailed two more times. I finally received a response.\n\nThis person is an independent businessperson who is always chasing the first million.\n\nThey said that basically the sky is falling. You know -- \"my car died,\" \"I had to relocate some of my inventory...\" One hard luck story after another. While I am sympathetic to their situation, it is not my problem.\n\nMy wife is stressing out about this, as she is a very caring woman, much more than I. But I have explained to her that we made the loan together as a family.\n\nI am not sure how to respond to their email, other than to say, \"I'm sorry about your current situation, but when can you pay us back?\"\n\nI have already explained in detail to the in-law that we moved and we also had car troubles and issues with our new house and that we needed the money.\n\nDear Owed: Unfortunately, I think you should prepare yourself for the fact that you are unlikely to be repaid. You seem to have discussed financing terms with your in-law, but the terms are vague, and you don't mention having any signed agreement on paper.\n\nAlso - asking, \"When can you pay us back\" invites the answer, \"Never.\" You should convey, \"We expect you to begin repaying this loan on [specify a date]. Your monthly payment should be [specify an amount]. If you don't make payments, we have no other choice but to contact a lawyer.\"\n\nPlease -- this is an expensive lesson, but in the future -- never loan money that you cannot afford to lose.\n\nDear Amy: I was friends with a group of around a dozen women that I met during college 20 years ago. We all stayed friends over the years after graduating, taking trips together, gathering for baby showers, and enjoying an annual holiday gathering. I traveled out of town to attend many of their weddings.\n\nPresently, many of these women are married with families. While the planned gatherings lessened over the years (family commitments started to take precedence) the group continued to vacation together each summer.\n\nA few years ago, I realized I had been left off the invite list. I know this because pictures are posted on social media.\n\nAnother friend has also been ostracized. We aren't sure what happened or what prompted this exclusion. Seeing everyone smiling, together on vacation feels like salt in the wound.\n\nI long for the days when I was included. Yet I also think, \"Why be friends with a crowd that is no longer welcoming?\"\n\nShould I say something to one of the ladies? Thoughts?\n\n-- Salty Situation\n\nDear Salty: Because you are already being excluded, you don't have much to lose by inquiring about what factors might have led up to it.\n\nI believe the chances of you receiving a straight answer are fairly small, but judicious honesty would open up a conversation -- and give you the opportunity you deserve to express yourself. You should email or call the person in this group you are closest to. Say, \"I realize this is awkward, but I'm hoping you can explain why I'm no longer included in the group reunion. I really miss this gathering, and if there is a problem, I'd like the opportunity to try to clear it up.\"\n\nDear Amy: I'd like to add my voice to other readers who were charmed by your recent column, entirely devoted to testimonials from adults about their stuffed animals! Given all the uncertainty we are all currently experiencing, this column brought tears to my eyes!\n\n-- Trying to Stay Calm\n\nDear Trying: Me, too. But remember -- those of us who no longer have our stuffed animals, still have each other.","152":"Ask Amy: Biblical lender should look to Shakespeare Dear Amy: I'm wondering how to balance friendship and faith with a business transaction that has gone bad.\n\nI loaned several hundred thousand dollars to a longtime friend, as his business was struggling and he was going through a divorce.\n\nWe agreed on standard documentation and precise payment terms. He has paid only part of the loan back, and the nonpayment is creating financial issues for me.\n\nWe are both Christians, and I want to follow biblical mandates (as I see them) that require people to lend when asked. I also want to be a good friend. However, although my friend says that he feels bad about the situation, he does not seem to be prioritizing repayment or making wise financial decisions. For example, he and his business have incurred new expenses recently that I view as unnecessary.\n\nWould you consider the friendship over and treat this as a purely financial transaction? Or would you continue to cut him some slack? I see no reason to harm my own financial situation due to a friend's bad choices, but I don't want to be unfair or cruel to someone.\n\n-- A Remorseful Lender\n\nDear Remorseful: You frame your question by asking what I would do. But nothing in my own faith practice (or bank account) would enable this sort of extreme lending. If I want to and can afford to, I give, versus lend.\n\nNot to put too fine a point on it, but bailing out your friend has resulted in financial hardship for you, and has also enabled him to persist in believing the fiction that he runs a successful business. As you point out, he is not running a successful business. So -- except for delaying the inevitable -- how have you actually helped him?\n\nNow you have fewer assets to put toward doing good works, taking care of family members, helping those in dire need, contributing to charity (and, of course, your own church community). Imagine how many hungry mouths your thousands could feed, how many schoolbooks it could buy, how many church missions it could fund...?\n\nInstead, your kindness and generosity has resulted in lost assets, enabling your friend's mistakes, and, likely, a lost friendship. This is not your fault (it is his); your own choice, however, is your responsibility.\n\nPerhaps you should have chosen to follow a Shakespearean (instead of a biblical) mandate: \"Neither a borrower nor a lender be... For loan oft loses both itself and friend.\"\n\nYour lawyer or the courts might be able to tease out more payments and\/or a stake in your friend's company.\n\nYou should explore the work, wit and wisdom of Dave Ramsey, whose financial advice is both practical and Christian-focused. You would benefit from reading his book, \"The Legacy Journey: A Radical View of Biblical Wealth and Generosity,\" (2014, Ramsey Press).\n\nDear Amy: I couldn't use my regular subscription opera ticket, so I gave the ticket to my opera companion to give to a mutual acquaintance at our church.\n\nI've seen that acquaintance several times since then and she has my phone and email address for communication about church matters, and she has not said thank you. The ticket was fairly expensive. Should I say anything to her?\n\n-- K\n\nDear K: Your opera ticket may have been bestowed upon your church friend like so much manna from heaven -- and she might not be fully aware of the source. If your opera companion gave her the ticket, your role in this might have eluded the recipient.\n\nPeople who purchase subscriptions to theater seasons know how valuable individual tickets are, but someone less familiar might simply think that this ticket was \"extra.\"\n\nIdeally, you shouldn't have to nudge this acknowledgment along, but you should email your acquaintance to say, \"I've seen you a few times, but I keep forgetting to ask you -- how was your evening at the opera? I was so sorry to miss the production, but I am happy you could use my ticket.\"\n\nDear Amy: \"Bothered\" had a neighbor\/tenant whose early morning microwave jolted her awake.\n\nWhen it comes to noise, from housemates, roommates, spouses, or the newspaper delivery person playing loud music at 5 a.m. -- get thee to a drugstore and get a white noise machine. Pure bliss.\n\nEven my galloping-herd-of-elephants spouse went about his noisy routines and I never heard a peep.\n\n-- Blissed\n\nDear Blissed: It wouldn't have occurred to me that one kind of noise would cancel out another kind of noise, but many readers have recommended white noise machines.","153":"Ask Amy: COVID-19 may reveal some basic blessings Dear Readers: Because of syndication scheduling, I write and submit my columns two weeks in advance of publication. Due to this time lag, the Q&A's will not reflect the latest information about the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic we are currently facing.\n\nAs of this writing, Americans have started a program of social distancing, isolation, and in some cases quarantine. Concerts, sporting events, and public gatherings have all been canceled. Weddings, graduations, celebrations and vacations have been put on hold. Many workers have been furloughed or laid off. Children are home from school. The economy seems to be crashing. Families are sequestered in their homes, and people are anxious.\n\nEvery day in the very small town where I live, I put a basket full of oranges out on my front porch with a sign saying, \"Help yourself!\"\n\nThe parents who walk by with their young children send their kids up the sidewalk and onto the porch to pick out an orange. We wave to one another through the window.\n\nThe double-meaning of the wording on my sign was unintentional, but I like it. Yes, we all need to help ourselves. However, I am constantly reminded that -- even in our isolation, we should not feel alone, and it is imperative that we help one another.\n\nMost evenings, I stop at the small family-owned grocery store in our town. We neighbors keep a safe distance from one another. But the shelves are well-stocked, and the high school kids who bag the groceries will also carry them to your car. Without this store, people in my rural area would live in a food desert. I am filled with relief and gratitude to have access to good food.\n\nThe hospital workers, postal workers, first-responders, supply chain providers, teachers connecting with their young students remotely -- I am so grateful that they are helping the rest of us to stay safe and healthy.\n\nWhen you have so many externals stripped away, yes -- it is the basics that quickly emerge as daily blessings: Good neighbors. Mostly reliable wireless service. Drive-thru Dunkin Donuts.\n\nFor me, visits to the gym 10 miles away have been replaced by solitary walks in the woods. In the harsh northern climate where I live, spring creeps up in agonizingly tiny steps. Yesterday, I saw the first signs of fiddlehead fern breaking through the forest floor.\n\nI am reminded that, despite everything, spring will come; I hope I am not forced to wave at it through the window.\n\nI reached out on social media, asking people to share stories about plans delayed or denied, and many people pointed toward our creativity and quirky humanity as a faint silver lining to burnish this seemingly dark time.\n\nSome examples: Faced with an empty facility, workers at the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago released the penguins to roam the halls -- and filmed their adorable escapades, as they went on a \"field trip\" to meet other animals.\n\nJarret Krosoczka, author and illustrator of the wonderful graphic memoir \"Hey, Kiddo\" (2018, Graphix) is offering free daily online drawing tutorials for kids who are homebound (check his YouTube channel).\n\nFor foster youth who have aged-out of the foster care system, their college campus might be their only home. The organization Together We Rise is helping to arrange and pay for housing (togetherwerise.org).\n\nStorytime from Space has videos of in-orbit astronauts reading inspiring stories for children.

Due to this time lag, the Q&A's will not reflect the latest information about the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDear Amy: I live in a small town in Tennessee. I love my wonderful husband, but lately he is being too dramatic about COVID-19. He reminds me five times a day to wash my hands. He is also putting disinfectant wipes in my car.\n\nAmy, I know to wash my hands, and I am not that bothered by him putting wipes in my car.\n\nWhat really bothers me is that he is telling me to sleep in a different room than him! We have been happily married for 16 years, and we have always slept in the same bed -- even when one of us was sick.\n\nHe is telling me to wear rubber gloves when I cook meals for us. He's telling me not to leave the house.\n\nIn my opinion, everybody is making too big a deal about COVID-19.\n\nDear Frustrated: You seem to be under-reacting. This could be why your husband is so anxious about your -- and his -- hygiene and health. Your own attitude and behavior could be influencing an over-correction on his part.\n\nThis is from the (informative) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website (CDC.gov): \"The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person, between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).\"\n\nAs of this writing, the virus has not swept through your region. Perhaps you will get lucky, and it will somehow diminish before it gets to you.\n\nWhere I live, people are not leaving their houses. The entire region is locked down. The mere act of getting into a car and going somewhere \"nonessential\" seems like a far-off prospect.\n\nYou have the individual right to be lax, or foolish. You could get lucky and not get this virus. Or you could contract the virus and not have symptoms, so you would never know it.\n\nYou don't have the right to potentially expose other people with impunity.\n\nDo I think you should necessarily wear rubber gloves while you prepare dinner? No.\n\nBut if your husband was confident that you washed your hands and had washed surfaces you'd touched, he might not freak out quite so much. (He can also make dinner, by the way...).\n\nBottom line: if you took this more seriously, your husband might feel more comfortable sleeping with you. It's time for you to dial in to the reality of what is happening. Don't just react with annoyance to your husband. Talk to him about his anxieties and see if you can approach this menace as a loving team.\n\nDear Amy: Many of your readers write in with questions concerning their spouse or siblings without ever revealing anyone's gender -- including their own.\n\nWhy do you suppose that is? As a gay man, I waited 23 years to legally marry my husband of two years.\n\nNow married, I can't imagine referring to him as anything other than my husband.\n\nSpouse, partner, significant other, etc., just seem less honest and less concise and like I'm somehow diminishing his importance.\n\nDear Proud: I don't assign gender to people who write to me, unless they make it clear within their question.\n\nGender isn't always germane to the issues between couples. Surely, even in your own relationship you can see that some issues that crop up between couples are somewhat universal, regardless of gender or sexuality.\n\nI suspect, also, that some people deliberately mask their gender in order to mask their own identity, and create a further shield, protecting their own anonymity and that of other family members. And, of course, I respect that, too.\n\nDear Amy: My son is an RN in the emergency room at Alaska Regional Hospital in Anchorage.\n\nThe hospital emergency room is now seeing multiple cases of probable COVID-19 every day. They are reusing masks, as someone stole a number of masks from the nearby hospital.\n\nCan you urge people who have supplies to donate them to first responders, including fire departments and hospitals?\n\nAlso please tell hoarders to give their supplies to the first responders, that they should be sheltering in place, not hoarding.\n\nI worry for my son and his family (as he has two very young children).","155":"Ask Amy: It's hard to party with \"one-party\" rule Dear Amy: I am an intellectual conservative, living in liberal and one-party Berkeley, California.\n\nTime after time at dinner parties (even my own), the guests just assume that I am a liberal like they are.\n\nWhen I tell them that I'm fairly conservative, they just don't get it. They freely disparage \"right-wing hillbillies\" and say that all conservatives are \"evil people.\"\n\nOne time I countered, \"Forty percent of the people in this country are not evil. They are good people. They just have different values from yours.\"\n\nThe table became silent, they all glared at me, and the dinner party was ruined.\n\nWhat is one to do? Must one just smile faintly and bear it? What can one say?\n\n-- Frustrated Republican in Berkeley\n\nDear Frustrated: Whenever I try to tackle a politics-adjacent question, the reader-responses range the gamut from people decrying my conservative hot takes, my liberal views, or my \"both-sides-ism.\" This tells me that people are avoiding nuance, context, or subtext.\n\nMy take on the phenomenon you describe is that one unexpected and unfortunate consequence of our president's personal and public comportment is that it seems to have inspired a parallel mindset in the opposition. I do not lay the blame for the close-minded attitude of many progressives on the current administration; I simply note the parallels.\n\nEach of us is entirely responsible for our own behavior. But the stereotyping and overall narrow-minded attitude you describe is something you might want to gently ask these liberal intellectuals to reflect upon. Practice a question: \"Are you interested in learning more about how conservatives like me view current events -- and what we are thinking about?\"\n\nYes, it might be easier for you to simply sit through this sort of group-think, but you should not take the blame for \"ruining\" a gathering simply because you have asked people to be open-minded and rational. Nor do I think that you (or anyone) should feel forced to stay silent when others are being rude, crude, or reactionary.\n\nSurely anyone worthy of being called a \"liberal\" should defend your right to speak your own mind, and should maintain an attitude of open-minded curiosity about people who think differently than they do.\n\nDear Amy: I'm a media producer with an emphasis on video production. I mainly work on documentaries, so I usually work with people who don't have on-camera experience.\n\nWhen I put microphones on people, I try to make small talk about whatever common subjects I can think of (sports, pets, kids, where they're from, etc.). The goal is to loosen them up for when they have to talk on camera and to alleviate some tension regarding me, a stranger touching their body and clothes to properly place the mic and hide the cable. (I do always say, \"I'm putting the mic here, is that OK?\")\n\nRecently I put a mic on a very pregnant woman. I was going to say, \"Congratulations on the pending arrival, I have a daughter myself and it's great...\"\n\nInstead, I made a comment about the weather because I thought if I mentioned the pregnancy it would be akin to commenting on her body and I'm \"woke\" enough to know that people, especially women, don't like that.\n\nWas I correct in not acknowledging the pregnancy, or would using the pregnancy to relate on a \"I'm a parent too\" level be acceptable? Trying to make people comfortable and relaxed is my number one priority.\n\n-- Too Woke in Chicago?\n\nDear Too Woke: You understand the important role you have in helping to calm jittery nerves during what can be a nerve-wracking process. Your sensitivity is commendable.\n\nNo, you should not mention a woman's pregnancy as you are helping to affix her mic. The main reason for this is because a person getting ready to be interviewed on camera should be concentrating on their own preparation. Pregnancy is a diverting topic to discuss just before being interviewed.\n\nIf a woman makes a reference to her own pregnancy, then yes -- congratulate and briefly share your positive parenting experience with her, but the time for more leisurely chit chat is after the interview is wrapped.\n\nDear Amy: \"Just Wondering\" was worried about his girlfriend's habit of texting a (male) co-worker after work-hours. I agree with you that any of us has the right to maintain friendships outside of the love-relationship, but Wondering's girlfriend should show him her texts and reassure him. Secrecy makes all of this worse, maybe for no reason.","156":"Ask Amy: Job seeker is frustrated by follow-up Dear Amy: Have the standards of business ethics changed in recent years?\n\nI have gone to several job interviews, with zero follow-up from the employer or the recruiter who set up the interview.\n\nThese are situations where the employer contacted me and asked me to come in for the interview, telling me, \"We'll get back to you.\"\n\nI had two interviews recently which went well, I thought, but I never heard from them again. I even called to follow up -- my calls went to voicemail, of course -- and still no phone call, email or letter.\n\nI wish businesses would realize that when they do this, it leaves people with bad feelings about them, and we tell our friends. A rejection is fine, but a polite message back, such as: \"Thank you for spending your time with us, however, we have selected another candidate\" would bring closure to the process.\n\nIs it now OK to just blow off the person you asked to come in for an interview?\n\n-- Ignored\n\nDear Ignored: Business ethics have not changed. Hiring practices have changed, however.\n\nOne frustration for current job seekers is how communication with recruiters and employers seems to flow in one direction, controlled by the employer. When a (often off-site) recruiter sets up an interview, the only contact information you have is the recruiter's -- not that of the person who is conducting the interview.\n\nSavvy job seekers conclude an in-person or Skype interview by asking, \"Could you share your email address with me so I can follow up to thank you?\"\n\nIf the manager chooses to share an email address, you can keep in touch directly.\n\nA good recruiter will contact you after an interview, even if it is to tell you that you won't be hired.\n\nTo conduct an effective job search, you should be using all of the social networking tools available to contact potential employers -- not only via voice call, email, or letter.\n\nGlassdoor.com offers ways for you to receive -- and leave -- anonymous feedback about the hiring process with a specific company.\n\nDear Amy: In high school, I had a boyfriend who was addicted to cocaine. He became very mentally, physically, and sexually abusive.\n\nMy best friend at the time knew him, but she knew nothing about what was happening in the relationship.\n\nAfter leaving the relationship with the boyfriend, I ended up going to a mental hospital.\n\nWhile I was hospitalized, she and I reconnected. I told her all about this abuse. She is very aware of the physical and psychological scars I still have.\n\nRecently, I became aware that she's been hanging out with him more often in their friend group. She knows everything that he did to me and still chooses to hang out with him.\n\nI know I am being a little harsh, but I don't want to be around her or even talk to her because I don't want her telling him anything about me and my current boyfriend or our lives (when I was with him, this monster had me and family members in fear for our safety).\n\nShould I try to talk to her about this? Is it OK to just walk away from her because of this?\n\nDear Upset: Your duty is to take care of yourself, and you seem to have done an admirable job.\n\nLoyal friends will quite naturally not want to maintain a close friendship with an individual who has abused a friend.\n\nOf course, it is possible that the man who abused you has cleaned up his act and changed in a dramatic way, but you should not risk your own well-being by testing this possibility.\n\nYou are wise to keep your distance from the person who abused you, as well as anyone else who is connected to him. You don't need to spend your own valuable emotional bandwidth trying to assess this situation from every angle -- you need only to protect yourself, and -- in this case, the best way to protect yourself is to keep your distance.\n\nDear Amy: \"A Very Concerned Son\" became alarmed when his mother kept repeating herself during a phone call. Slurred speech and repeating yourself can be signs of severe dehydration.

Our middle son started having issues in high school with drugs and interactions with the police.\n\nNo matter what we tried, it only worked for a short time and cost us thousands of dollars.\n\nAfter high school he came home late one night with his girlfriend. She was dead the next morning from an overdose. This event led to a three-year prison term.\n\nAfter prison, things seemed better. He got a good trade job, married, had two children, house, cars, and was doing well.\n\nThen out of the blue the drugs were back. He drained their bank account. His marriage fell apart. He sat in his house for months until it was foreclosed upon and the sheriff removed him.\n\nNow he wants to move into our empty nest. With the drugs and the shady people he has been associating with, we don't want him living here.\n\nHe is trying his usual guilt trip to get us to cave.\n\nWe are just hitting 60 and getting very close to retirement. Given his situation and history, are we wrong to tell him to figure this one out himself, and that living here is not an option?\n\n-- Exhausted Parent\n\nDear Exhausted: Given what your son has already experienced -- and put you (and others) through -- I'm wondering what possible grounds he might have to send his parents on a guilt trip.\n\nFrom the evidence you present, he actually seems to do better when he is not living in your home. He has experienced a period of sobriety, and you should keep in close touch with him and support his efforts at recovery. Emphasize that he has done this hard work before, and that he can do it again. He is not starting over; he is starting again -- this time with experience.\n\nYou should convey that no, he cannot live at home, but you may be able to help him find rental housing and connect him with local services and addiction counseling.\n\nAsk open-ended questions. Do not overwhelm him with suggestions, or assume that you can \"fix\" him. Check drugfree.org for parent resources, including their phone helpline, text, and email support. Communicating with other parents in a similar situation will help to clarify your position.\n\nDear Amy: We've been friends with a couple for over 20 years.\n\nOur son grew up with their son -- from elementary school through high school graduation. They played sports together and maintained a friendship.\n\nTheir son is getting married this summer, and our friends just informed us that while we are invited, our son and his wife are not -- due to cost.\n\nOur son will be hurt knowing that we (capable of giving a generous gift) are invited, but he and his wife (scraping by while he is in school and she is teaching) are not (and they would have spent their \"gifting\" money on expenses for attending the wedding -- had they been invited).\n\nAre we out of line to think that this is just bonkers?\n\nThe groom would much rather have his buddy (my son) and his wife at his wedding than us. We thought that this was weird.\n\nDo we ask his parents to exclude us from the festivities and invite our son and his wife instead? Your thoughts?\n\n-- Invited\n\nDear Invited: It seems strange that the parents are communicating about the wedding guest list, instead of the groom and bride.\n\nYou imply that you have been invited because you can afford to give a gift. This seems an unkind assumption to make. And, of course, you could give a gift even if you hadn't been invited.\n\nYou should not dictate the guest list. You could try to clarify this by asking the parents, \"Are you sure the marrying couple wouldn't rather have our son and his wife at the wedding, instead of us? If so, we totally understand.\"\n\nDear Amy: I totally disagree with your terrible advice to \"A Very Concerned Son,\" who called 911 after his mother kept repeating herself over the phone.\n\nSince when does anyone have the right to send a bunch of strangers storming into someone's private home?\n\nIf one of my kids did this, I'd never speak to them again.\n\n-- Upset\n\nDear Upset: I wonder how you would react if one of your kids exhibited alarming behavior, indicating a possible medical crisis?","158":"Ask Amy: Mother's mistakes come back to haunt her Dear Readers: Because of syndication scheduling, I write and submit my columns two weeks in advance of publication. Due to this time lag, the Q&A's will not reflect the latest information about the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic we are currently facing.\n\nWhen she was very young, I divorced her dad and moved hundreds of miles away. I married a man with two sons and a parenting method that I didn't agree with, but I felt trapped with him -- the way I'd felt trapped with her dad. We were together for 10 years.\n\nI waited until after my daughter graduated from high school, and then I separated from her stepfather. It was very difficult to live on my own and we ended up getting back together. It was more out of convenience than anything.\n\nWhen I told my daughter that I was getting back together with him, she blew up and told me that her stepbrother had drugged and raped her several times. I was in complete shock! She has not spoken to me since then.\n\nI think about her every day. I stalk her on Facebook (with an unrecognizable profile) just so I can see her life. I can't be a part of her life because she has blocked me. This estrangement breaks my 83-year-old mother's heart, and I would like to see us all together again.\n\n-- Regretful\n\nDear Regretful: If you want your relationships to change, then you need to change. It's really that simple. Although you admit to having regrets, you don't seem to have taken responsibility for the role you played in your daughter's trauma. Your reaction to her disclosure that she was raped while in your household was to express shock, and then passively sigh -- and continue on to reunite with your ex.\n\nAre you not aware that the best thing to do when someone reports a rape is to call the police? (And people wonder why assault victims hesitate to report!)\n\nYes, you've made mistakes. Admitting this is definitely a step in the right direction, but you don't get to claim victimhood, here. Until you take responsibility for your parental neglect, passivity, and terrible judgment, you cannot hope for a reconciliation. Even your Facebook-stalking seems to me more melodrama than the action of a mother desperate to make things right. You are not Stella Dallas standing in the rain, wistfully watching your daughter through a window. You are not the victim of her blocking you. There are many ways -- other than Facebook -- to contact someone, however, until you can commit to positive change, it is probably wisest for your daughter to keep her distance.\n\nA compassionate and competent counselor could walk you through the events in your life that have culminated in this moment. With coaching and positive change, the reconciliation you desire might be possible. I hope you will try.\n\nDear Amy: \"Queasy in Florida\" wanted to put an anonymous note in the mailbox of a woman at her retirement community, criticizing her behavior at the home's communal dining table.\n\nThank you for recommending a discreet, in-person conversation. My loving, kind, 86-year-old parents just voluntarily moved into an assisted-living community. My dad wore a hat in the dining room because his head is always cold.\n\nSomeone left a copy of the dress code at their apartment door with an arrow pointing to \"no hats in the dining room.\"\n\nMy mother was furious, and I was heartbroken that someone would be so catty and cowardly toward my wonderful parents, especially as they were brand new and just getting used to their new home.\n\n-- Protective Daughter\n\nDear Protective: Nonjudgmental, discreet, and in-person is almost always the best way to communicate.\n\nDear Amy: I was absolutely blown away by the letter from \"Justin,\" the young transgender man who sent you a follow-up after you published his question about how to communicate with his parents over the holidays.\n\nSo many of us in the LGBTQ community are tasked with extremely challenging and awkward social or family-related negotiations. It's not fair to us, but yes -- humor always helps.\n\n-- Been There\n\nDear Been There: Justin is a special person -- I appreciated hearing back from him that his parents are really coming around. The companion letter in that column, from the mom of a transgender girl, showed how hard it can be for parents to adjust how they refer to their transgender kids.","159":"Ask Amy: Not all relationship flags are red Dear Amy: For the past few months, I have been dating a guy who (I thought) could be \"the one.\"\n\nTonight, he told me that instead of just being married one time (for 18 years), he was actually married a second time (for two years). This came out of nowhere. I was totally aware of his first marriage and two kids, but was completely blindsided by the revelation of the second marriage (which in his words was a horrendous mistake).\n\nI don't know why he wasn't honest from the beginning, and I am concerned he only brought this up to save our relationship.\n\nYes, I see the many red flags, but keep seeing his \"good side.\" It's what I tend to do, and I do it well.\n\nI understand him wanting to get everything out in the open now. I want to encourage his honesty, but should I be concerned that it took so long to share this two-year marriage with me?\n\nWe have been super-open and honest about everything, or so I thought.\n\nHow do I move on trusting that there is no other shoe to drop?\n\nDo I need to calm down? OR is this the brightest shade of red on a flag yet?\n\nThis disclosure was offered, freely, as a way to further your intimate connection (what you call \"saving the relationship.\") Granted, the disclosure should have been made earlier.\n\nYour guy deeply regrets this second marriage. He is embarrassed by it. Have you fully disclosed your most embarrassing and regrettable episodes?\n\nHave you told him about your most horrendous mistake? If so, your own honesty and trust may have inspired him to feel comfortable enough to disclose his.\n\nYes, I believe this is a flag, but not necessarily a red flag. Take it more as a sign that you two are on a journey toward intimacy, and also as a very good reason not to rush headlong or blindly forward. You should always be responsible and self-protective regarding your own choices.\n\nAnd yes, you should ask him what other headlines he has buried.\n\nIn short: Trust, but verify.\n\nDear Amy: In a completely unexpected and delightful turn of events, a fabulous guy and I found each other and we have been joyfully together for a couple of years.\n\nWe are both \"seniors\" (70-ish), with parallel experiences of marriage, children, and divorce. I think we are both a little bit shocked that our relationship is so much fun, and so strong, and shows every sign of continuing. Our families and friends are \"all in.\"\n\nNeither of us has a desire to marry, blend finances, or cohabit. I guess you'd call us LTA's (living together, apart), which seems to be the latest \"thing\" in senior relationships.\n\nAnd yet...something seems unfinished. A formal commitment? Yeah, if I'm perfectly honest, it would be nice. I can't say exactly why, but I would really treasure wearing his ring, and having him wear mine. Not marriage, but a proclamation about the way things are between us.\n\nAm I being shallow in asking for something a little bit more permanent? If he didn't want to, I could let it go.\n\nIf I worked up the courage to ask for a ring, would he think my request touching -- or corny?\n\n-- Senior-itis\n\nDear Senior-itis: When my husband and I decided to get married, I said, \"Engagement rings are a young-woman's game. I don't think I want one.\" He said, \"Oh, you're getting a ring, missy. And it's going to be beautiful.\" (I did, and it is.)\n\nMy point is that there is something about a ring. The way it encircles your finger and reminds you of your commitment. Ask your guy how he feels about exchanging rings.\n\nDear Amy: \"Just Wondering\" was bothered by his girlfriend texting back and forth with a male co-worker.\n\nI am willing to bet if a woman had written that letter, you would have advised differently. If a man were to receive text messages frequently from a female co-worker during off hours, I am sure his female partner would have a lot to say about that ... and many women would agree with her.\n\nDear Upset: I asserted the woman's right to have a friendship, the man's right to have honesty and transparency from his partner, and anyone's right to ask their partner to limit their texting.","160":"Ask Amy: Preschool trampoline party gets more bouncers Dear Readers: Because of syndication scheduling, I write and submit my columns two weeks in advance of publication.

This would not have been an issue if this were a party at home or an outdoor park. However, we were at a trampoline park where you have to pay $20 per participant. Non-participants (such as parents) are free.\n\nWhen we received the bill, it showed that we had 27 kids!\n\nI felt it impolite to put on the invitation that only the named guest can participate. Is there a polite way to make sure we're not paying for siblings we don't even know when throwing a party at an amusement center?\n\n-- Tapped Out\n\nDear Tapped Out: I am assuming that parents also accompanied these very young kiddos -- and brought their other children with them, perhaps assuming that you had a group rate.\n\nI shared your question with Gay Cioffi, longtime director of the Little Folks preschool in Washington, DC, who publishes a helpful parenting newsletter, \"Little Folks, Big Questions (littlefolksbigquestions.com).\n\nCioffi responds: \"I have been a witness to every possible size and shape of birthday party. Everything from keeping the guest number in line with the age of the child: four-years-old equals four guests (I love that), to an extravaganza with 300 people at the Four Seasons Hotel.\n\n\"Because you are dealing with families and young children, you need to expect the unexpected, i.e., a \"bug\" is going around, and lots of people don't show up, family members are visiting and join the invitee, or the birthday child is overwhelmed and cries the whole time (most often).\n\nSince young children are not always keen on being dropped off, or if parents are actually invited, you can assume siblings may come too. I don't think there is a polite way to say you are not paying for siblings. If finances are a concern, next year, I would plan a smaller gathering with room for growth.\"\n\nDear Amy: My sister and I have disagreed about diet for years; I am vegan, and she and her spouse eat meat (only about twice a week, I believe).\n\nWe love one another, our relations are cordial, and we never argue about her diet. When my spouse and I visit, she cheerfully accommodates us.\n\nAlthough my central reason for not eating animals is that \"they don't like it,\" health is also a major concern, and occasionally I send my sister a link with a scientific study pointing out the health-protective benefits of plant-based diets.\n\nI try to be sparing with the links, because I know people who are always dispensing health advice can be annoying.\n\nWith the COVID-19 epidemic, my concern for my dear sister's health is mounting. We are both well past 65, she has had major health crises in the past, and I want her to be alive and well for many more years.\n\nI would like to send her some links showing that adopting a plant-based diet quickly fosters a healthy microbiome (gut flora) that boosts one's immunity -- without putting her off.\n\nAmy, I know dispensing physical health recommendations isn't your job. But if you would consult some nutritionists and check this out for yourself, and -- if you find it convincing -- mention it in your column, it might help my sister decide to stop eating animals, at least for the duration of the epidemic.\n\nIn fact, knowing there is something we can do to strengthen our immune systems now might help many, especially the elderly, to be less fearful. Fear can do a lot of damage to society.\n\n-- G\n\nDear G: You seem to have advocated for your point of view, over and over. Your sister has reacted politely by respecting your dietary choices.\n\nI agree that fear can do a lot of damage. And so maybe you should stop trying to scare your sister.\n\nDear Amy: \"Not Looking\" was a widower in an assisted-living facility.

I reacted to both columns by owning my gullibility and doing my very best to laugh along with my readers.\n\nI rerun these two questions (and my original answers) today, with the reminder that -- even in this very serious world we inhabit -- it's important not to take yourself too seriously.\n\nAt the end of this column, I'll reveal the original sources of these problematic plotlines.\n\nI'll be back with original Ask Amy Q and A next week.\n\nDear Amy: I have a serious problem with my future wife. She has not been faithful to me. I recently overheard her talking to her friend about how she was unfaithful to me. When I confronted her, all that she said was that she couldn't talk right now. I feel like I have to record everything in my own house just to learn the truth.\n\nTo make things even more stressful is the fact that she recently told a couple of people that I hit her, but it's not true. I did not hit her. I'm not sure why she has been acting like this lately. She did just find out that her mother has breast cancer, and that might be playing a role in her behavior.\n\nWe still always find time to make love, so I don't know why she would go out seeking it from someone else. I just can't believe she would do this to me. I love her so much, she is my everything, and I don't know that I could go on without her. She is tearing me apart.\n\nDear Devasted: The first thing you should do is to NOT get married. Your fiancee's behavior and your response are the very essence of dysfunction. If you are correct and she is stepping out on you, this is a huge problem. Your declaration that you feel like you \"have to record everything ... just to learn the truth\" is chilling. Her counter-accusation that you hit her is potentially very dangerous for you.\n\nBecause of an escalation in behavior I sense in both of you -- and the seemingly toxic connection between you two -- it would be wisest for you to separate. Seek the support of close friends, family, and a professional counselor to help you deal with this loss and change.\n\nI didn't want to bother him, but much to my surprise he approached me. Turns out he knew me from my profession. He asked if I wanted to go out for coffee, and we exchanged numbers. A few days later we had coffee, and I thought it was pretty cool that he considered us friends.\n\nThen everything changed. He told me he was interested in taking out a woman we ran into. She is my ex-girlfriend and we've remained good friends. He asked me a couple of times if I wouldn't mind if he asked her out. I reluctantly said no. I made plans with him, and then after talking to my ex I found out that he ditched our plans to go out with her.\n\nThe next day he called me and asked if I could help him move some furniture. I barely know the guy, next thing he will be asking me to drive him to the airport. Two friends of mine warned me not to trust this guy. What's the deal -- am I being too rash, or should I dump the guy as a friend?\n\n-- Feeling Foolish\n\nDear Foolish: The good news here is that you won't have to dump the guy as a friend because he is not a friend. He's an opportunist who just keeps asking you for stuff.\n\nI suspect that when you turn down his generous offer to let you move furniture for him, you'll likely never hear from him again.\n\nJanuary 2016\n\nDear Readers: The first question (from \"Devastated\"), is from the cult movie \"The Room,\" which is widely beloved and possibly the worst movie ever made.\n\nThe question from \"Feeling Foolish\" is based on a famous \"Seinfeld\" plotline co-starring Metes star Keith Hernandez.","162":"Ask Amy: Toxic family leaves a mark Dear Readers: Because of syndication scheduling, I write and submit my columns two weeks in advance of publication. Due to this time lag, the Q&A's will not reflect the latest information about the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic we are currently facing.\n\nDear Amy: I have abandonment issues. My biological mother left me when I was a baby. Due to the extreme parental neglect in my infancy, the courts awarded custody to my paternal grandmother. My father moved in with her as well.\n\nIn my mind, my father \"saved\" me from a world that I could've died in, but the truth is, he was just as responsible for my neglect.\n\nMy father remarried, and my grandmother allowed me to live with my dad in his new home with his new wife. I called her \"Mom\" until she passed away.\n\nMom was not affectionate toward me. She was very strict.\n\nFast-forward to now. I am 50 years old. My biological mother and stepmother are both dead. My father remarried again and moved hundreds of miles away.\n\nMy issue is a new resentment toward my father. Having learned that he wasn't the saint I always thought him to be, I find I don't want to speak to him much.\n\nI love him very much, but I'm hurt that every woman in his life has had such an influence on him to the neglect of, not just me, but also my two half-sisters.\n\nI don't really want to go down this path. My bitterness toward my biological mother, and lack of love from the woman that raised me has made me a cold person toward family. I feel more empathy toward strangers than my own relations (sometimes, even my own children, which I am acutely ashamed of).\n\nTherapy is not easily accessible in my rural area, so I'm left to my own devices.\n\nWhat advice can you provide that may warm my heart toward the very few that have loved me?\n\n-- Heart Two Sizes Too Small\n\nDear Heart: You already seem to have a lot of insight about your challenging past. You have made the connection between the neglect you suffered as a child and your own hesitance (or inability) to express affection toward family members. Insight is a positive start, and you can definitely continue to grow and change.\n\nAs a child, your emotional needs weren't met. Your mother abandoned you and then the other adults in your life didn't provide an emotionally safe and nurturing environment.\n\nTo love others fully, you have to learn to fully love yourself. Loving yourself doesn't mean you are arrogantly declaring how great you are, but that you are learning to accept and embrace your own vulnerability, owning your own mistakes, and leaning into your determination to do better. Your very efforts toward healing and self-love should be considered your first triumph.\n\nOne way to love others is to physically be there for them. Be present, especially for your children. Show up for them. Express an interest in their lives and be bravely expressive toward them. You should tell them your own story, share your insight, express the desire to be better, and tell them you are in their corner -- through good times and bad. You are trying to break a generational chain of neglect, so understand that your kids may be bewildered, hurting, and affection-starved, too.\n\nYou would benefit from reading \"Healing Your Emotional Self,\" by Beverly Engel (2007, Wiley & Sons).\n\nDear Amy: I am an average-attractive single woman who lives in a big city.\n\nI am frequently approached by men of other races that flirt with me and try to get my phone number.\n\nHow do I tell them I am not interested without offending them? I stick to my own kind.\n\n-- No Thanks\n\nDear No Thanks: It is fairly easy to say, \"No thank you.\" But if you truly want to repel these interested men, you could tell them the truth: \"No offense, but I'm a racist.\"\n\nThey should leave you alone after that.\n\nDear Amy: Thank you for your response to \"Shy in Boston,\" the shy guy who was wondering how to possibly meet a nice woman in the supermarket.\n\nIt may sound like a clich\u00e9, but this is how I met my husband! He somewhat shyly asked me for advice about produce.\n\nThe rest is history.

I have become close with one of the ladies there; she has been married for 17 years.\n\nLady Friend tells me intimate things about her sex life with her husband. Lady Friend does not feel loved or appreciated by him. I have confided in Lady Friend about my marriage, too, but I don't go into detail about my sex life.\n\nMy wife knows I am friends with this lady, though I don't share every detail of this friendship with her. Lady Friend and I send text messages back and forth, sometimes all day long.\n\nLady Friend takes an interest in a few other men at the gym, and I know she loves the attention. Lady Friend has hinted about meeting me outside the gym.\n\nIs it wrong for me to continue being friends with this lady since we are both married? Should I back off? Do you think this lady likes me as more than just a friend?\n\n-- Anonymous\n\nDear Anonymous: My question to you is, do you spend any time, any time at all, on the elliptical machine? Or is your relationship with your \"Lady Friend\" the only way you elevate your heart rate during these so-called workouts?\n\nTo answer your question, I don't know if Lady Friend sees you as more than a friend. So, let's talk about you.\n\nYou and Lady Friend are acting like true gym rats. This is cheesy and sleazy, and you know it's wrong. So, interrupt this particular circuit. Recommit to your marriage and your workouts.\n\nSeptember 2010\n\nDear Amy: Nine years ago, my daughter and her husband asked me to move with them into a new home.\n\nI had been widowed for five years and they felt I should not be alone. (I am now 84 and in pretty good health).\n\nWe all got along very well until about six months ago, but I don't know why. Nothing was ever said openly. They purchased a lake house recently and spend weekends at that home. I am not invited (nor do I want to be). There are no children involved -- just the three of us. I do have a little dog that he seems to hate -- but I cannot give the dog away.\n\nLately I get the feeling that my son-in-law is not happy with our situation. He barely speaks to me and mumbles \"good morning\" or \"good night.\"\n\nI contribute to the household, pay rent, clean house, wash their clothes, take care of their dog, etc. I have spent thousands of dollars on this house and paid a third of the purchase price.\n\nShould I speak to my daughter about this? She and I get along very well. I feel she knows there is friction here but has not said anything to me about it. Should I look for another place to live? I don't really want to live alone but I will if I have to.\n\n-- Challenged\n\nDear Challenged: First this: Your arrangement seems to have worked well for everyone for nine successful and peaceful years.\n\nUnfortunately, each person in the household seems extremely averse to bringing up a topic -- or even asking a question -- that might result in an uncomfortable moment or two, and so you have spent the last six months engaged in an extremely uncomfortable silent standoff. It is human nature to avoid discomfort, but you all have taken it to a new level.\n\nYou are a full partner in this household -- you helped pay for the house and pay rent and expenses.\n\nSit down with them (if you can't manage to face him, speak with your daughter). Say, \"I feel a lot of tension lately; can you tell me what is bothering you? It would be good to clear the air. I miss the way we all used to get along.\" This might have started over a very trivial household matter. Or it might not have anything to do with you -- but with work, marriage or health difficulties of theirs. Maintain an open attitude and try not to be defensive.

We have been in a long-distance relationship for 18 months.\n\nHe is my first major love and relationship. Now our current (yet tentative) plan is to move in together after my Ph.D. is done and his business settles. He is very supportive and I'm happy being with him. However, I'm not sure if I'm ready.\n\nI've lost myself as I put so much energy, time and effort to our relationship, instead of investing in myself. I became emotional and I'm not as productive or disciplined as I was. I don't know how to balance myself, as this is my first relationship. I'm not sure if a relationship is good for me or I'm ready to be in one. I want to focus and invest in myself without his influence because I'm scared of losing myself even more.\n\nMy boyfriend wants to be supportive, but we are both so clueless. Should we break up, or find a balance?\n\nIs there a way to be in a relationship and still be your most productive\/career-driven self in your 20s?\n\n-- Unsure\n\nDear Unsure: Regardless of the plans you two have made, you should dial in to that feeling in your gut. Your early-20s is a time of emotional development and exploration, and in that sense, your concern about this demonstrates that you are right on track.\n\nThe ideal -- for you, for your guy, and for everyone -- is to find a healthy balance, in your life and relationships. It is not unusual to feel like you've \"lost\" yourself when you first fall in love. It's called \"falling\" for a reason. That sensation of tumbling through space is thrilling, but it is frightening, too. And yes, obsessively feeding one relationship will curtail your own personal and career progress. Remember, the primary relationship in your life will always be the one you have with yourself.\n\nYou should choose to live wherever your Ph.D. takes you, in order to build a career in your field, and no -- given how you are feeling, you should not cohabit until you are absolutely certain.\n\nIf you move to his city, renting a room in a group house (instead of cohabiting) might be a good idea for you.\n\nDear Amy: Why is there a stigma about living with your parents?\n\nIn many cultures around the world multi-generational households are considered the norm. No stigma exists.\n\nMy home is in a very high rent area where people pay as much as two-thirds of their income for housing.\n\nI decided to rent out two bedrooms. My renters each have their own area in the house, as do I. My tenants are my adult children. All expenses are split equally, as are household duties as defined in our tenant contract.\n\nWe respect each other's privacy.\n\nThe advantages of this arrangement allow for each of us to pay far less than we would living on our own. We all get to live in a well-maintained, nice home in a part of the country we love.\n\nWe take care of each other's pets when someone is away.\n\nDear Lea: This arrangement sounds ideal. I agree with you that the North American concept of rugged individualism may have created a stigma about adults living with their folks, but this same concept also allows you to ignore the stigma, and live as you please.\n\nDear Amy: Your advice to \"Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow\" was off base.\n\nThis girls' volleyball coach had insisted that she shave her arm pits and legs.\n\nShe wears a \"uniform,\" as in, the coach wants his team to look \"uniform.\"\n\nIf this young woman wants to play volleyball that badly, then she should follow the coaches' rules.\n\nSure, there is gender discrimination in the world, but this smacks of too much micro-feedback, and to call it discrimination goes way too far.\n\nInstead of supporting the coach and his idea of how to be proud of his team, you rule in favor of a young teenager who now learns that she can go over his head to the school administrator for stupid stuff.\n\n-- Margie\n\nDear Margie: In my mind, demanding that this young athlete shave her body is the essence of \"micro-feedback.\" As I said in my response, unless male volleyball players are also asked to shave, I think this girl should be left alone.","165":"Atul Bedade Suspended As Baroda Women's Cricket Coach For Alleged Sexual Harassment | Cricket News Former India batsman Atul Bedade was on Saturday suspended as Baroda women's cricket team coach with immediate effect after players accused him of sexual harassment and public shaming.

The skipper has been at the helm for many an Australian success but took that to a new level at the MCG, an 85-run victory over India sealing their first crown on home soil. But it was far from an easy journey to the top for Lanning, with a group-stage victory over New Zealand and the semi-final success against South Africa among her most stressful cricket moments.\n\nEverything was worthwhile by the end, however, with the unity of her Australian team a mentality to behold for the ever-modest Lanning.\n\n\"There's a lot of pride. This tournament was always going to be massive, we had our ups and downs throughout and everything was thrown at us,\" she said.\n\n\"To be able to come through and have the complete performance on the biggest stage, it's something that's pretty amazing and is testament to the group for delivering on that. The New Zealand game and the semi-final, that's the most nervous and sick I've felt playing cricket.\"\n\n\"To get through that, coming in to the Final, everyone was a little on edge but it just happened. It was just there from the first ball, there's ups and downs throughout but to be able to lead this group is a real privilege - they make my job really easy.\"\n\n\"It's such a great group to be a part of. Everyone rode the bumps, the highs and lows, to finish like this is just incredible.\"\n\nSuch was the magnitude of the Melbourne final, Lanning struggled to settle at all prior to the match. Never before has the women's game seen a crowd comparable to the 86,174 that packed into the MCG, with the International Women's Day occasion one to behold for all involved.\n\nBut the 27-year-old was calm when it mattered most - largely thanks to her Australia teammates holding back their own nerves on the big day. It wasn't always that way throughout the competition, admitting that their narrow escape from elimination forced a roller coaster of emotions in front of their home fans.\n\n\"This day is incredible, we couldn't have dreamed of this,\" she added. \"When the organisers said they wanted to get that many people for the final, I must admit I was a bit skeptical. But you wanted to be there and be involved. There was such a big build-up, all the outside pressure and expectation - we wanted to come and win this tournament but it was something else.\"\n\n\"The way we were able to react and deal with that was testament to the group - this day is certainly the best of my career so far. With this group of people, the support staff as well, Tayla [Vlaeminck] and Pez [Ellyse Perry] who weren't out there on the field but were as much a part of it, it's such a special group and we really just good mates and love going out there and playing together.\"","167":"Australia Players Celebrate Women's T20 World Cup Win By Dancing On Stage With Katy Perry. Watch | Cricket News Australian women's cricket team won their fifth T20 World Cup title after beating India in the final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Sunday. After the match, the Australian players shared the stage with American pop star Katy Perry to celebrate their record-extending title victory. Some of the players even took the centre-stage and enthralled the audience with their electric dance moves. Katy Perry, who set the tone for the historic finale with her electrifying performance, encouraged the players to show-off their dancing skills, and one player who stood out was Sophie Molineux. Sharing a video of the the celebration, Cricket Australia tweeted: \"World Cup champion and dance sensation Sophie Molineux had quite the night with her new mate Katy Perry! #T20WorldCup\".\n\nIn the video, Molineux can be heard explaining her feelings about last night's performance and the surreal experience of sharing the stage with the pop icon.\n\n\"Yeah, I woke up and had to watch it three or four times to get my head around the fact that I was for one -- out there with Katy Perry, and two dancing and pretty much taking her off stage so I could take centre stage. But she was awesome with us, She embraced the fact that she had 15 other back-up dancers with her. But yeah, it was pretty special,\" Molineux said in the video.\n\nAustralia, playing in front of their home crowd, outplayed India in all three departments of the game.\n\nAustralia batted with great intent from the ball one and never allowed India to get back in the game and posted 184\/4 --the highest-ever total in a T20 World Cup final be it men's or women's cricket.\n\nAustralia bowlers also bowled brilliantly and bundled India out for 99 runs, thus clinching the final by 85 runs for their fifth title.","168":"Autologous transplantation of spermatogonial stem cells restores fertility in congenitally infertile mice Stem cell transplantation is widely used to rescue defects in stem cell-derived cells. However, it is generally impossible to rescue tissue dysfunction caused by defective microenvironment. In this study, we report that autologous spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) transplantation rescues congenital male infertility caused by Cldn11 deficiency. Cldn11-deficient mice lack spermatogenesis due to defects in the blood-testis barrier. However, WT or Cldn11-deficient SSC transplantation allowed development of fertile sperm from the donor cells in chemically castrated Cldn11-deficient mice. Because in vivo depletion of Cldn3 or Cldn5 restored endogenous spermatogenesis, complete spermatogenesis may be inhibited by the imbalance of claudin expression caused by Cldn11 deficiency. Our result suggests that some forms of male infertility can be rescued by autologous SSC transplantation.\n\nThe blood-testis barrier (BTB) is thought to be indispensable for spermatogenesis because it creates a special environment for meiosis and protects haploid cells from the immune system. The BTB divides the seminiferous tubules into the adluminal and basal compartments. Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) have a unique ability to transmigrate from the adluminal compartment to the basal compartment through the BTB upon transplantation into the seminiferous tubule. Here, we analyzed the role of Cldn11, a major component of the BTB, in spermatogenesis using spermatogonial transplantation. Cldn11-deficient mice are infertile due to the cessation of spermatogenesis at the spermatocyte stage. Cldn11-deficient SSCs failed to colonize wild-type testes efficiently, and Cldn11-deficient SSCs that underwent double depletion of Cldn3 and Cldn5 showed minimal colonization, suggesting that claudins on SSCs are necessary for transmigration. However, Cldn11-deficient Sertoli cells increased SSC homing efficiency by >3-fold, suggesting that CLDN11 in Sertoli cells inhibits transmigration of SSCs through the BTB. In contrast to endogenous SSCs in intact Cldn11-deficient testes, those from WT or Cldn11-deficient testes regenerated sperm in Cldn11-deficient testes. The success of this autologous transplantation appears to depend on removal of endogenous germ cells for recipient preparation, which reprogrammed claudin expression patterns in Sertoli cells. Consistent with this idea, in vivo depletion of Cldn3\/5 regenerated endogenous spermatogenesis in Cldn11-deficient mice. Thus, coordinated claudin expression in both SSCs and Sertoli cells expression is necessary for SSC homing and regeneration of spermatogenesis, and autologous stem cell transplantation can rescue congenital defects of a self-renewing tissue.","169":"Automotive Filmmaker Shares Behind the Scenes of Viral Super Car When you decide to make a video with one of the world's best professional drivers on a closed track showing off the power of a supercar, you make sure to do it right and spare no expense.\n\nAutomotive filmmaker Al Clark shared a detailed behind the scenes look at the making of a viral video shared a couple of years ago, where a Bugatti Chiron goes from zero to 400 kilometers per hour, then back down to zero in 42 seconds.\n\nIt all happened in Ehra-Lessien, Germany at a Volkswagen test track facility.

Skipper Virat Kohli had put in a lot of emphasis on workload management before the IPL last year but most players, who were in contention for a place in the 2019 World Cup squad, ended up playing all games for their respective franchisees. It has been learnt that the national selectors will sit down during the Irani Cup, which will be held right after the Ranji Trophy final and take a call after checking the workload and medical database of all centrally contracted players.\n\n\"We will communicate our concerns to the respective IPL teams on workload management of the players.

Its design was chosen after an annual competition sponsored by the magazine and the American Wood Council. Criteria were that the house be built mostly of wood and that it occupy no more than 1,500 square feet. ''Elegance, flexibility and luxury'' were emphasized.\n\nBecause of an emphasis on showcasing novel uses of wood, the actual house price was closer to $85 a foot, according to builder H. Charles McNally, president of Lanid Corp. of Parsippany, N.J.\n\n''I can see why it's called the Best Small House. But it certainly isn't the most inexpensive Best Small House,'' says McNally, agreeing that luxury doesn't come cheaply. ''We used cedar shake shingles instead of asphalt roofing, and top-quality siding and wood cabinetry.''\n\nAn average-size Colonial-style house in the United States is between 1,800 and 2,000 square feet, McNally says. The Best Small House provides an illusion of greater space with only 1,500 square feet, he says, adding that the house fits comfortably on a quarter-acre lot.\n\n''We got a lot of living in a small amount of space,'' McNally says.\n\n''The architects provide that illusion with curved walls and serpentine ceilings. And no matter where you sit, you can look outside.''\n\nArchitects Allan Shope and Bernard Wharton of Greenwich, Conn., were chosen to design the structure.\n\n''Part of the challenge was to give the house a sense of luxury and presence that belied its small structure,'' Wharton says. ''To do this, we played subtle tricks with scale, height, the number of chimneys, the size and placement of windows and the overall building mass. All these elements contributed to making the house seem much larger.''\n\nThe oversized roof (with 2-foot soffits) has four chimneys. One is strictly cosmetic, another is connected to the furnace. The two others serve fireplaces in the first floor dining and living rooms.\n\nThe house's profile emphasizes the vertical. A high, V-shaped window and balcony overlook the entry; a light well exists over the back porch. A curved stairway leads from the foyer to the second floor, where there are three bedrooms, two bathrooms and a washer and dryer.\n\nA master bedroom measures 11.6 feet by 14 feet, excluding a private bathroom. The two other bedrooms share a connecting bathroom and measure approximately 11 feet by 12 feet each.\n\nDesigner Mariette Himes Gomez of New York created the interiors. To achieve an illusion of greater space downstairs, she designed simple green-and-white geometric patterns on its wood floor. ''I utilized color, pattern and scale to show that with proper planning, rooms can appear to almost double in size,'' Gomez says.\n\nDetails on acquiring building plans ($95) for the Best Small House will be available from the magazine after publication in March.","173":"BHU V-C reviews preparedness for Covid-19 | Varanasi News - Times of India Varanasi: Vice chancellor of Banaras Hindu University Prof Rakesh Bhatnagar, on Monday, held a high-level meeting and reviewed the measures being taken on BHU campus to in light of Covid-19 outbreak.\n\nThe meeting was attended by rector Prof VK Shukla, IMS director Prof RK Jain, medical superintendent Prof SK Mathur, nodal officer Covid-19 Prof Jaya Chakravarty, registrar Dr Neeraj Tripathi, finance officer Abhay Thakur, professor in-charge of Trauma Centre Prof SK Gupta, and head of microbiology department Prof Gopal Nath.\n\nBHU spokesperson Rajesh Singh said that the VC also reviewed the patient cure facilities available at Sir Sunderlal Hospital, Superspeciality Block and Trauma Centre.

Liton hit 176 off 143 balls, the highest ever individual ODI score for Bangladesh, while Tamim stayed unbeaten on 128 off 109 balls as the duo put on 292 runs in Bangladesh's highest partnership for any wicket.\n\nTamim had scored Bangladesh's previous highest score in the second ODI just three days ago.\n\nLiton and Tamim guided Bangladesh to 322-3 in 43 overs before 4-41 from Mohammad Saifuddin ensured victory and gave captain Mashrafe Mortaza a fitting farewell.\n\nIt was Mashrafe's last game as Bangladesh's ODI captain after he announced his decision to step down from the position on Thursday and his teammates rose to the occasion to dominate Zimbabwe.\n\nAs Bangladesh's innings was interrupted by rain, Zimbabwe were set a revised target of 342 in 43 overs under the DLS method, but were bowled out for 218 in 37.2 overs, with Sikandar Raza making 61.\n\nMashrafe, who oversaw 50 wins as skipper, began the demolition in the very first over before finishing with 1-47, while Taijul Islam (2-38), Mustafizur Rahman (1-32) were also among the wickets.\n\n\"This is a great honour.

New customers only.\n\n'WE WOULDN'T EVEN LOOK AT EACH OTHER': VIDUKA LIFTS LID ON KEWELL FEUD\n\nViduka, who held the Socceroos' captaincy prior to Neill, ended a long media exile of his own to get some bad blood off his chest in an explosive interview with ESPN.\n\nThe legendary striker accused Neill of trying to undermine him at the 2007 Asian Cup and accused him of \"sulking\" amid an awkward transition of the captaincy under then-coach Graham Arnold.\n\nIt's far from the first time Neill has had mud slung in his direction. While rightly regarded among Australia's greatest ever footballers, Neill copped it over a perception he was money-hungry during a career the featured many big-money moves across England, Turkey, the Middle East and Japan.\n\nMany believe it was the criticism he copped late in his playing career -- both over his form and some controversial comments questioning the commitment of the next gen -- that resulted in him turning his back on public life. Fox Sports' Robbie Slater and Mark Bosnich were among those calling for him to be replaced in 2013.\n\nSlater is one of the few to have spotted Neill in Australia since, running into him at a shopping centre in Sydney's north a few years ago. He went to approach him, and make amends, but claims Neill blanked him and hid in the pasta aisle in Woolworths.\n\n\"It was embarrassing, I was embarrassed,\" Slater told Sportingnews of the incident.\n\n\"I just wanted to say hello. He could have had a crack at me, I wouldn't have cared.\n\n\"He hasn't done anything wrong...the only thing he is guilty of is disappearing at a time when the game needs him.\n\n\"His career should be celebrated. He should be a national hero.\n\n\"I can't work out who he is angry with. FFA? Ange (Postecoglou)? Fans? The media? Or is it all of us?\"\n\nDukes comments 'unfortunate'\n\n3:43\n\nFormer Socceroos boss Ange Postecoglou perhaps offered the biggest clue as to the reason for Neill's reclusiveness in his 2016 book Changing the Game.\n\nMaking the tough decision not to take Neill to the 2014 World Cup due to a lack of game time, Postecoglou recalled Neill's response was threatening to \"go to ground\" if he wasn't picked again.\n\n\"It's almost three years since that phone call and he hasn't surfaced, so he was true to his word. He seems to have gone into hiding and I sort of wish that wasn't so for one of our greatest-ever Socceroos,\" Postecoglou wrote, also admitting he has some regrets ending Neill's international career over the phone.\n\n\"Being the captain and leader of the country for such a long time, Lucas had had a celebrated career. Regrettably it finished on the end of a phone line.\n\n\"The end for Lucas shouldn't have been a call from me telling him he wasn't going to the 2014 World Cup. I wonder if he would have felt any better if I'd told him in person. Maybe I should have taken him out to dinner.\"\n\nThe saddest part of Neill's post-career story came in 2016 when it emerged he had been declared bankrupt in the UK, reportedly due to a series of disastrous investments., despite earning more than $40 million throughout his career.\n\nSO WHERE IS HE NOW?\n\nApproaching a decade since the last of his 96 appearances for the Socceroos, Neill remains lost to many in the Australian football community. Even his long-time agent from his playing days hasn't spoken to or heard from him in seven years.\n\nIt's believed the 42-year-old and his family now reside in Lancashire, where his Premier League dream took flight with Blackburn in 2001.\n\nHe has at least re-emerged onto the football scene, albeit as a spectator.\n\nNeill's son Marcus, a talented striker, joined Liverpool in 2010 and the Socceroos legend is regularly spotted at the club's youth games.\n\nNeill has also been involved coaching Marcus' local cricket team, the Lowerhouse's Fagan and Whalley Hornets -- pictures in 2017 showing him umpiring like any other regular cricket dad.\n\nNeill, it appears, has just been getting on with his life, without feeling the need to utter a word publicly about his Socceroos demotion, bankruptcy or the highs and lows of a remarkable career.\n\nOne day he may feel the need to do so, and there may well be two sides to the story when it comes to Viduka's account of the controversial 2007 Asian Cup campaign.\n\nJust don't expect to hear Neill's any time soon.","183":"Bard on the Beach organizers announce season cancellation due to COVID-19 The organizers of Vancouver's popular Bard on the Beach Shakespeare Festival have announced the cancellation of this year's events.\n\nIn a joint statement issued by Christopher Gaze, the founding artistic director, and Executive Director Claire Sakaki, the pair announced that, after a month of \"intensive exploration of what might be possible\" due to the continuing COVID-19 closures and related industry changes, the decision was made to cancel all planned events in order to, \"ensure the health and well-being of all those people who would gather together at our site and in turn, be in contact with others.\"\n\nThe news release went on to detail that the decision to pull the plug on the event, which was scheduled to take place from June 10 to September 26 in Vanier Park, was a \"deeply painful\" one to make.\n\nThis summer was to represent the festival's 31st season.\n\nThe planned lineup featured A Midsummer Night's Dream, Henry V, Love's Labour's Lost, and Paradise Lost.

Beasley decided to shoot it. It went in.\n\nIt may have seemed like an inconsequential shot, but for Beasley, at least he got to see his final shot go through the hoop on his worst night shooting in a Wolves uniform. Beasley had just five points on 2 of 11 shooting.\n\nIt was Beasley who scored efficiently in the Wolves' last two games (29 and 21 points, respectively) while D'Angelo Russell struggled. The roles were switched on Tuesday with Russell getting 28 points on 8 of 15 shooting.\n\n\"They've had games where they've both clicked too,\" coach Ryan Saunders said. \"It's the NBA. There's nights where teams do a good job of defending somebody. Nights when a guy just gets hot and the basket looks big. So I thought Malik, he's played really well for us and he'll continue to play well.\"\n\nSaunders made a point that perhaps Beasley is getting a little more attention as his numbers have gone up since coming from Denver to Minnesota.\n\n\"He's highlighted on scouting reports now,\" Saunders said. \"So I thought they did a nice job of trying to limit him.\"\n\n'Sleepwalking' offense\n\nRussell had some moments of brilliance on Tuesday night when he looked like James Harden's equal on the offensive floor, especially with some of the stepback shots he was hitting.\n\nOverall, it was a mixed bag for the Wolves offense, which shot 48%. Even though Russell had a good night, as did Juancho Hernangomez (18 points), Russell thought the Wolves were out of sorts on that end of the floor.\n\n\"I felt like we were sleepwalking to be honest, including myself,\" Russell said. \"Of course I made a few shots, but I don't think it was as fluent as we've done previously and what we need to win games. I think we were just kind of really sleepwalking.\"","187":"Bed-type variability and till (dis)continuity beneath Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica | Annals of Glaciology | Cambridge Core Recent seismic measurements from upper Thwaites Glacier indicate that the bed-type variability is closely related to the along-flow basal topography. In high-relief subglacial highlands, stoss sides of topographic highs have a relatively higher acoustic impedance ('hard' bed) with lower acoustic impedance ('soft' till) on lee sides. This pattern is similar to observations of many deglaciated terrains. Subglacial hydraulic-potential gradient and its divergence show a tendency for water to diverge over the stoss sides and converge into the lee sides. Convergence favors a thicker or more widespread water system, which can more efficiently decouple ice from the underlying till. Under such circumstances, till deformation does occur but, fluxes are relatively small. Till carried from the lee sides onto stoss sides of downstream bumps should couple to the ice more efficiently, increasing the ability for transport by till deformation. In turn, this suggests that steady-state till transport can be achieved if the stoss-side till layer is thin or discontinuous. In addition, the large basal shear stress generated in the highlands seems too high for a bed lubricated by a continuous although thin deforming till, suggesting till discontinuity, which would allow debris-laden ice to erode bedrock on stoss sides, supplying additional till for transport.","188":"Bedrooms don't need closets Everyone knows that you need a closet in a bedroom to call it a bedroom, right? While this is a universally accepted de facto standard, good luck finding any type of authority that will back this up. At least not here in Minnesota. As a home inspector, this isn't something that concerns me, but I get asked about this frequently. Thankfully, it's pretty simple: you don't need a closet.\n\nThere's nothing in the Minnesota State Building Code that requires a closet. I'm not aware of a single municipality that requires a closet. There's also nothing in the Minneapolis Housing Maintenance Code that requires a closet. In fact, they go so far as to say this in the Minneapolis Truth-In-Sale of Housing Evaluator Guidelines:\n\nNOTE: Sleeping rooms do not need a closet to be considered a sleeping room, per MHMC, although lenders may require that sleeping rooms have closets.\n\nSo where does this so-called 'requirement' come from? I don't know. It had to be a standard somewhere, at some point, or it wouldn't have so much traction today. But still, that's a good point that the city of Minneapolis brings up about lenders possibly requiring a closet. I've heard that this used to be a requirement for FHA loans. Lenders can ask for whatever they want, and as a home inspector, I don't attempt to guess at what lenders will want.\n\nI've also heard through the grapevine that real estate agents weren't supposed to list rooms without closets as bedrooms. Apparently, that requirement went away a very long time ago, but people have long memories.\n\nSo what if you're buying or selling a home and someone gets hung up on the closet thing? How do you get around that? Let's start by defining what a closet really is.\n\nThe term 'closet' is defined by the building code as \"A small room or chamber used for storage.\" A chamber is \"a natural or artificial enclosed space or cavity\". This means a 6\" box with a door that's installed on the wall could be called a closet. Right?\n\nOk, maybe that's silly. How about an armoire or a wardrobe? I've seen plenty of houses with only wardrobes in the bedrooms, and nobody had a problem with that. I'd argue that the cabinets, er... chambers shown below could be considered closets.\n\nIf someone insists that a room needs a closet to be called a bedroom, throw one of these in there. If someone argues that it's not permanently installed, put a screw through it into the wall. There. Now it's permanently installed.\n\nHere at Structure Tech, we try to make a big deal about the big stuff and a little deal about the little stuff. This is little stuff.\n\nBedrooms do not need closets to be called bedrooms; at least not here in Minnesota. The next time someone tells you a bedroom needs a closet, ask for proof. If you find an authoritative reference that says a bedroom needs a closet anywhere in Minnesota, please share it with me.","189":"Beethovenfest cancellations Like most other music events and concerts for the forseeable future across the nation, the March edition of the Beethovenfest was called off.\n\nJust two days before it was to open, the March week of the Beethovenfest was cancelled. Ten concerts and a number of other events jhad originally been scheduled for March 13 to March 22.\n\n\"I was of course terribly sad and shocked,\" Beethovenfest director Nike Wagner told DW. \"But we're all in the same planetary boat, and basically, it is the right decision. We can't do anything but contain it; delay until a vaccine is found. I feel sorry for the musicians.\n\n\"You can only turn your eyes to the heavens and ask, what's going on here?\"\n\nCancelling the fall edition of Bonn's Beethovenfest in September is not on the horizon yet but dropping the ten-day festival in March, a special edition in the Beethoven's anniversary year, was just the next move as one major event after the next is dropping off the calendar throughout Europe.\n\nThe festival's unique spring edition was to include the performance of all of Ludwig van Beethoven's nine symphonies, played by Russia's musicAeterna orchestra under its founder, the charismatic Greek-Russian conductor Teodor Currentzis. Italian maestro Giovanni Antonini was to conduct on two evenings. It is unclear whether any part of this program can be included at the Beethovenfest Bonn in the foreseeable future.\n\nFor the time being, the festival management is holding on to the main season of the Beethovenfest that traditionally takes place in the fall and is scheduled this year for September 4 to September 27. It is impossible to tell how the corona crisis will impact the festival's very international lineup of artists. The same applies to all music festivals in Germany at present, regardless of genre, from classical to pop.\n\nPresentation of the fall program under the motto \"Resurrect, yes resurrect\" was scheduled for March 23, but has been postponed to a yet to be determined later date.","190":"Beggars, street urchins to be tested | Vadodara News - Times of India Vadodara: Detection of three COVID-19 cases in Nagarwada has sent alarm bells ringing in health department of Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC).

He ruled Tunisia with an iron fist for 23 years until he fled into exile in Saudi Arabia in January that year. This followed popular and mostly spontaneous and peaceful demonstrations in the country.\n\nWhat sealed Ben Ali's fate was the army's withdrawal of support and its refusal to fire on protesters. By the middle of 2011 a Tunisian court had convicted him and his wife of embezzlement. They were both sentenced, in absentia, to 35 years in prison. In a second trial, he was convicted of smuggling drugs and guns, and sentenced to 15 years in prison.\n\nThe spontaneous protests that toppled him first erupted in December 2010. They followed the self-immolation of a young street trader, Mohamed Bouazizi. He was frustrated at constant harassment by local officials that made it impossible for him to earn a living as a street trader, and to support his family.\n\nRioting quickly spread across the country, with young Tunisians using social media to organise demonstrations. The events in Tunisia were to reverberate across the region, and leave a lasting imprint.\n\nDivided opinions\n\nThe demonstrators were of all ages. They were demanding an end to corruption, decent jobs and a reduction in economic inequalities as well as an end to political repression.\n\nBen Ali's ousting enjoyed wide support. According to a public opinion poll carried out by Arab Barometer in 2011 only 8% of Tunisians thought that his downfall was a loss to the country. And only 12% expressed a preference for a regime like the one he led.\n\nNevertheless, there are disagreements among Tunisians, Western governments, commentators on the Middle East and academics about what Ben Ali achieved while in power.\n\nNewspaper reports following his death suggest that he has left a mixed legacy. Public opinion in Tunisia remains divided.\n\nHe is generally credited with bringing social and economic development to Tunisia, but failing to lay the foundations for Western style democracy. This, however, does not tell the whole story. It also doesn't enable us to understand why few, if any foresaw the fall of his regime.\n\nChequered legacy\n\nBen Ali was an army officer and politician who ascended to the Presidency in 1987, after a bloodless \"medical coup\" - he manoeuvred to have the then incumbent President Habib declared incompetent by reason of senility.\n\nHe came to power with a reputation as a hardliner, but promised political and economic reforms. He is widely credited with having introduced neoliberal reforms that brought sustained economic growth, a civil state and progressive gender policies.\n\nSome commentators have argued that these reforms helped prevent Islamic extremists from gaining a foothold in his country.\n\nIt is certainly the case that the economy grew under Ben Ali. According to World Bank data, Tunisia enjoyed an average annual growth in GDP per capita of 3.2% between 1987 and the 2008. Growth slowed to 2% in 2009 in the wake of the global economic crisis and following the uprisings fell to -3% in 2011. The economy has still not recovered to pre-uprising levels.\n\nBut economic growth wasn't enough. Most Tunisians benefited little. Unemployment remained relatively high at around 15% and youth unemployment at about 30%.\n\nIn addition, crony capitalism became firmly embedded, with Ben Ali, his family and close friends as the main beneficiaries of economic polices.\n\nThe middle classes resented the growing inequalities and the decline in decent employment. Their educated sons were forced into precarious jobs in the informal sector, and their daughters withdrew from the labour market altogether.\n\nOne of the main reasons for the success of the uprising was that the middle and working classes, including the trade unions, came together as a unified force.\n\nBen Ali's record on democracy and human rights was even more woeful. The initial reforms allowing political pluralism were quickly abandoned, supposedly because of a need to suppress Islamic extremism. This drove political dissent underground, forcing people to find new ways to express themselves, mainly by mobilising online.\n\nBen Ali's attempts to enforce a secular state also backfired, including his attempts to promote gender equality. While the urban elite adopted Western secular lifestyles, the majority of Tunisians, who lived in rural areas, continued to live their lives in ways informed by Arab or Muslim values.\n\nStill not out of the woods\n\nFollowing the initial euphoria after he went into went into exile, Tunisians have become increasingly disillusioned with their government.\n\nIn the most recent survey by Arab Barometer in late 2018, 79% of adults thought that government performance was poor, 92% that the state of the economy was bad and 90% that the government was corrupt.\n\nWhile Tunisians still agree that democracy is the preferable form of government, only 22% think that it is suitable for their country.\n\nBen Ali's exile may have stopped a bloodbath as happened in Libya and Syria following uprisings in those countries. But, it has still not ushered in a government that is responsive to its citizens' demands - including decent jobs, acceptable living standard and an end to corruption.","193":"Bernd Heinrich on the nesting lives of tree swallows Bernd Heinrich is one of our foremost natural history authors.

The Comeback Caps dug many holes and climbed back out of a large number of them, but which comeback was the best? We created a bracket to find the answer of what was the best comeback of the season.\n\nROUND 1: Caps rally for 6-5 win over Sharks (JJ Regan) vs. Vrana's OT winner finishes opening night comeback vs Blues (Jason Murphy) The set-up\n\nJJ: Logan Couture scored an empty-netter with exactly one minute remaining in regulation to put the Sharks up 4-2 and the game was over. The red-clad fans at Capital One Arena began migrating en masse for the exits because you can't overcome a two-goal deficit in 60 seconds. There was probably a fair amount of grumbling from Caps fans as Todd Reirden pulled Braden Holtby yet again for the extra attacker. As if losing to one of the worst teams in hockey wasn't bad enough, now the team was opening itself for the Sharks to tack on yet another empty-netter.\n\nJM: It's Opening Night of the NHL season. The 2018 Stanley Cup Champion Washington Capitals were forced to watch the 2019 Stanley Cup Champion St. Louis Blues raise their banner. The Caps remember this night last year when they boat-raced the Boston Bruins by a final score of 7-0. Enterprise Center was electric and then the Blues scored just 53 seconds after the opening puck drop.\n\nUh-oh.\n\nSt. Louis would tack on another goal from Alex Pietrangelo seven minutes later on the power play and it looked like Washington was headed for a similar fate as Boston the year before.\n\nThe comeback\n\nJJ: There were several key moments in the final minute and in overtime to set this up, but the catalyst of it all was Jakub Vrana's goal just 13 seconds after Couture made it 4-2. By scoring so quickly, Washington suddenly had 47 seconds to work with to get one more goal. Suddenly the task ahead of them did not seem so daunting.\n\nNicklas Backstrom pulled off a great pass to set up T.J. Oshie in the slot and he tied the game with just 15 seconds remaining. Once the game got to overtime it was not as if a demoralized Sharks team just collapsed. San Jose should have won it twice, but Braden Holtby turned in two dynamite saves to keep Washington alive long enough for Lars Eller to score off a 2-on-1 break with John Carlson.\n\nJM: Alex Ovechkin clawed one back before the first intermission, walking through the Blues defense on the rush and beating Jordan Binnington. From that point, the Caps outshot the Blues 25-15 but the Caps still needed Holtby to make multiple game-saving stops. A Dmitry Orlov slapper deflected off a Blues stick halfway through the second period to tie the game. Holtby had one more important save in the last minute of regulation.\n\nAnd then Vrana turned on the jets and netted the overtime winner, wheeling around the top of the zone before a wicked wrister beat Binnington and the comeback was complete.\n\nThe importance\n\nJJ: In terms of the season, those were two important points the Caps were in danger of forfeiting. It's not the games against the good teams that are important during the regular season, it is the games against the bad teams because those are the games you need to win. Those are the points you can't afford to give away. Washington has not been very good since Dec. 23, but have managed to stay afloat in the standings largely because they have still been able to collect points against bad teams. A loss in this game would have been the Caps' third loss in four games.\n\nIn a more historical sense, this was the first time in franchise history that Washington was able to overcome a multi-goal deficit in the final minute of regulation to win. Anytime you can make history, that's a big night.\n\nStory continues\n\nJM: No history is made in the first game of the season so it is hard to say this was a hugely important win, but beating the defending champs is always a good thing. It doesn't have the dramatics of the Sharks win but this game was hanging at the edge of a cliff and the Caps walked it back and Vrana showed us all a glimpse of what was to come for him personally and for the Caps in a season full of comebacks.\n\nWhich comeback gets your vote?\n\nJJ: Let me repeat myself just in case it didn't sink in the first time: This was the first time in franchise history the Caps were able to overcome a multi-goal deficit in the final minute of regulation to win. Of course the win over the Sharks should advance, it's no contest.\n\nJM: As much as I'd love to argue this one, it's clearly the Sharks game. Two 6-on-5 goals in the final minute is going to beat just about anything you throw at it.\n\nYou decide!\n\nCALL TO ACTION\n\nCLICK HERE TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE CAPITALS TALK PODCAST\n\nStay connected to the Capitals and Wizards with the MyTeams app. Click here to download for comprehensive coverage of your teams.\n\nMORE CAPITALS NEWS:\n\nChallenges ahead: Backstrom on NHL resumingThank You: Tom Wilson thanks healthcare workers on IGProud Father Moment: Oshie's daughter learns to bike\n\nBest comebacks of 2019-20 bracket: Stunning the Sharks vs. battle of champions originally appeared on NBC Sports Washington","196":"Best shows of the week: Ashwini Ramaswamy, Flint Hills, Grand Old Days and more Ashwini Ramaswamy doesn't get as much attention as her sister, Aparna, and mother, Ranee Ramaswamy, who are the founders and artistic directors of Ragamala Dance.

Potential leaders are being whittled down by their parliamentary colleagues before the party's roughly 160,000 members vote on which of the final two will get the top job in British politics.\n\nIt's inevitable that one topic has come to dominate the discussion in the contest. Much of the focus will be on the candidates' plans (or lack of plans) for Brexit. That is somewhat inevitable, given this is the most prominent issue in British politics and the fact that Theresa May's departure is largely due to her inability to find a Brexit \"plan B\" after the House of Commons rejected her deal.\n\nEach contender is promoting a different Brexit vision in their campaign. But the EU says the deal on the table cannot be renegotiated. And if many of the candidates are to be believed, the UK is ready to leave without a deal on October 31. So there appears to be little scope for a change of course.\n\nMeanwhile, the next Conservative leader does not have to call a general election until 2022. Of course an election can be forced by a vote of no confidence, but 2022 must be the focal point for this campaign.\n\nGiven that the next leader has the potential to lead the country for the best part of the next three years, focusing solely on an issue which most candidates say should be resolved in little over the next three months seems short sighted. The successful candidate should have strong positions on other issues too, and these should be clearly outlined in the campaign. Here are some of the topics we need to see covered.\n\nAusterity\n\nIt has been eight months since May declared that \"austerity is over\" (though the chancellor Phillip Hammond has been more cautious, saying only that austerity is coming to an end). Such austerity-driven policies are continuing to hit families, as a recent UN report demonstrated, when it claimed 14m people in the UK live in poverty and 1.5m are destitute.\n\nEven if the government is correct in dismissing the report, it makes stark reading and has been used to decry the current government's economic policies, which the report defined as \"punitive, mean-spirited and often callous\".\n\nThe failures of the government's austerity agenda is a key issue that the Conservatives' political opponents, not least Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, have highlighted.\n\nIf an election is held off until 2022, it's likely that the economy, rather than Brexit, will be the determining factor of any party's success. There have been some tentative moves in this direction, with candidates promising to increase spending on schools. But, as yet, these have not been fully costed. They're still a long way from forming the basis of a meaningful macro-economic strategy.\n\nThe lack of a parliamentary majority\n\nA more immediate problem for the incoming leader is that of the current parliamentary arithmetic. This election will not change that. Currently the Conservative Party has 313 MPs in the House of Commons - 12 seats short of an overall majority (as convention ensures that the speaker only votes if there is a tied vote), and nine seats short of an effective majority (as Sinn F\u00e9in MPs do not take their seats or vote). It relies on the support of the DUP's 10 MPs to win votes.\n\nWhile this problem is important in any Brexit vote, it affects the government's ability to pass all other legislation too. The current parliament has been in session for almost two years (typically it is in session only for a year) and is due to rise this summer. One of the first jobs the new leader (and PM) will be tasked with is to present and pass a Queen's speech - which outlines the legislative agenda of the government for the parliamentary session (and must therefore extend beyond Brexit). Failing to get parliamentary support for this is akin to losing a vote of no confidence and would lead to the fall of the government.\n\nLinked to this is the question of what to do about Northern Ireland, which has been without a devolved assembly since January 2017. Agreeing any future confidence-and-supply agreement with the DUP is likely to raise questions about restoring some form of power sharing in Northern Ireland. Any potential new deal is likely to be more heavily scrutinised than in 2017, by both the Conservative and DUP's political opponents.\n\nSaving the party\n\nAs well as being prime minister, the leader will have to work to unite the Conservative Party. The party's divisions run deeper than Brexit. The question of Islamophobia is still prevalent (something some of Boris Johnson's comments will do little to diffuse). The party is also suffering a declining membership. Its remaining membership base is ageing too, raising concerns about the future sustainability of the party. Just as May's path to the leadership has been used to explain her unpreparedness for - and failures to engage within - the 2017 general election, the next leader needs to demonstrate broader appeal across the country.\n\nBrexit might be the most important issue but other factors matter immensely. One of the critiques of May following the 2017 general election was that she didn't have any practice at engaging members of the public during her leadership campaign. Failure to explore and debate these issues could lead to ad-hoc or ill thought-out policies.","198":"Big Bang Theory plot hole: Huge error with group's Time Machine uncovered Time travelling has been a staple of science fiction for decades, as franchises like Back to the Future, Doctor Who and Star Trek have experimented with the concept of going backwards and forwards through time.\n\nNo mega-geek worth their flux capacitor goes through life without becoming an expert in time travel, and The Big Bang Theory gang was no different.\n\nFrequenters of movie props and memorabilia, one of their most impressive purchases occurred in the first season, during the episode The Nerdvana Annihilation.\n\nTaking their collectible obsession to the next level, Leonard (played by Johnny Galecki), Sheldon (Jim Parsons), Raj (Kunal Nayyar) and Howard (Simon Helberg) all chip in to buy a miniature replica from the 1960 film The Time Machine.","199":"Big brother is watching: how new technologies are changing police surveillance The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations\n\nWhen we think of surveillance, we tend to imagine traditional surveillance tools like CCTV systems run by local authorities. The use of CCTV has certainly increased since I was a young constable on the Gold Coast in the early 1990s. From a CCTV network of 16 cameras when they were first introduced to the city precinct, the network has grown to more than 500 cameras today.\n\nBut surveillance is much more than just CCTV. It now includes things like private home or business security systems, police body-worn cameras (BWC) and the use of helicopters and drones. And we all have the capacity to conduct surveillance and gather evidence using the technology contained in our mobile phones.\n\nThese new technologies are changing the way police approach surveillance. Rather than using surveillance tools reactively to catch criminals caught in the act on camera, police are now proactively seeking out criminals in the process of offending and recording the evidence on the spot.\n\nRead more: Turning 'big brother' surveillance into a helping hand to the homeless\n\nCCTV helps solve crime, not prevent it\n\nMost studies show that CCTV by itself does not necessarily prevent crime, but it does assist in responding to and solving crime.\n\nIn the Boston bombing case, police used footage and images from state, public and private sources to identify the suspects. CCTV is also proving crucial in identifying the bombers who staged the recent coordinated attacks in Sri Lanka.\n\nTwo studies released by the Australian Institute of Criminology last month focused on the use of CCTV by police. The first showed that where police requested and used CCTV footage, there was an increase in the rate of matters being solved. The second study showed CCTV footage is highly valued by law enforcement personnel, with 90% of investigators using the footage when it was available. Two-thirds were able to use it for the reason they had requested it.\n\nNew tools, new capabilities\n\nWe are now seeing a move from reactive surveillance to proactive surveillance.\n\nPolice body worn cameras (BWCs) are an example of this. Every police service in Australia is now using BWCs. Rather than just recording a criminal event by chance, BWCs enable police to actively seek out those committing offences, and record the evidence against such offenders.\n\nQueensland Police requires its officers to record whenever the officer is acting in the performance of his or her duties. The device must be recording prior to, and during, the exercising of a police power or applying a use of force.\n\nThis requirement can be problematic since the officer must physically start the recording. In the shooting matter of Justine Damond in the United States, officers were criticised for having their recording devices turned off during the shooting.\n\nSome services have attempted to deal with this issue, such as Western Australia Police for instance, by having the BWC automatically begin recording when an officer draws their firearm.\n\nEven traditional CCTV is becoming proactive with the introduction of mobile CCTV cameras that can be moved as required to areas of community concern.\n\nMany police services are using drones for tasks such as crowd management, surveillance and target acquisition. Queensland and Victoria are just are two states that are committed to the use of drones for policing purposes. In 2017, Queensland Police had a fleet of ten drones.\n\nRead more: How artificial intelligence systems could threaten democracy\n\nFacial recognition enables 'predictive policing'\n\nFacial recognition software was once the thing of Hollywood movies like Mission Impossible. It's now a reality, with the Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agreeing to share biometric data, such as drivers licence details and passport photos, between government agencies.\n\nFacial recognition software was used by police during 2018 Commonwealth games in Queensland. And the Queensland government has indicated police will continue to use facial recognition tools - although confusion surrounds when or how it will be deployed. The ABC has reported that the facial recognition system was so rushed that it lacked the data to operate effectively during the Commonwealth Games.\n\nFacial recognition adds a predictive policing capability to traditional CCTV systems. In essence, predictive policing or pre-crime policing is an attempt by law enforcement to disrupt criminal activity by the early identification of criminal threats.\n\nFor example, Operation Nomad saw a South Australian police visiting suspected and convicted arsonists when automated number plate recognition alerted them to suspects driving in fire danger zones. The operation was credited with the reduction of bushfire related arson.\n\nRead more: You may be sick of worrying about online privacy, but 'surveillance apathy' is also a problem\n\nKeeping a watch on big brother\n\nSurveillance is changing from being static, fixed and reactive to being flexible and proactive. The enhanced capabilities helps law enforcement fight crime, rather than just solve it.\n\nThe Coalition government promised A$20 million to increase the number of CCTV cameras across the country. Under the proposal, up to 2,600 cameras would be installed at 500 \"crime hot spots\".\n\nWhile this is a largely positive move, we must ensure that there is accountability and transparency in the use of these technologies, and ensure they serve the purposes for which they were intended. An effective governance regime is essential to instill public confidence in the use of these technologies.","200":"Bills GM explains reason for Stefon Diggs trade The Buffalo Bills have a new top wide receiver in veteran wideout Stefon Diggs, who left the Minnesota Vikings in a trade that, in hindsight, was a long time coming despite the initial, sudden reaction for the split between player and franchise. Bills general manager Brandon Beane, nonetheless, told the media on Monday he knows Diggs \"knows ball.\"\n\nPer Mike Giardi in NFL.com:\n\n\"It's just a more proven thing right now and what we're dealing with did weigh into that,\" Beane said on a video conference, via ProFootballTalk. \"I know this guy [Diggs] knows ball and will be able to understand the verbiage once he learns our system.\"\n\nBeane first checked with the Bills last fall during the NFL's mid-season trade deadline but revisited Diggs' availability in March.\n\n\"It didn't seem like a definitive 100 percent no, they just were not shopping him,\" Beane said.\n\nIn the 26-year-old Diggs, the Bills get a 1,000-plus receiving yards wideout with playoff experience. After Buffalo lost to the Houston Rockets in the AFC Wild Card Game last January, the AFC East club sought after improvements for the wide receivers corps to help out young quarterback Josh Allen.\n\nDiggs caught 63 receptions for 1,130 yards last season, connecting with veteran quarterback Kirk Cousins for six touchdowns as well. While the former fifth-round pick from the 2015 NFL Draft out of Maryland caught 39 fewer passes between 2018 and 2019, he still tallied slightly over 100 more yards this past season than two years ago, averaging nearly eight more yards per reception, too.\n\n--\n\nFollow NFL on ClutchPoints on Twitter & Instagram, and like us on Facebook.

There are precautions to take, however, particularly if you are with other people.\n\nThese comments come from Dr. Peter Crosson, a birder in Massachusetts. He posted them to a birding email list in his state. I received them from Madeleine Linck, a birder formerly of Medina, now living in Massachusetts.

It's not social distancing when you are clustering in groups, and\n\ncertainly not when you are sharing optics such as scopes.\n\nAnyone of us can be exposed to the virus through asymptomatic friends, so it is not enough to restrict yourself to hanging out with people who have no symptoms.\n\nSince this began, I have gone birding once with another person.

We kept 6 feet distance between us at all times, and did not share any optics.\n\nIf you are not following procedures like that, you're not social distancing.

Frequent handwashing and use of at least 60 percent alcohol-based hand sanitizer is also crucial.\n\nIt discourages me when I look on eBird and see multiple people reporting the same group checklist from a site.

However, the most telling performance for the 10 members of Black Market Brass in their unusually busy summer actually might have been last month's more milquetoast gig at Log Jam in Stillwater.\n\n\"Seeing a bunch of teenagers and other Stillwater people getting down to our kind of music was kind of mind-blowing,\" guitarist Hans Kruger said, admitting it took the band a few songs to win the crowd over.\n\nContinued baritone sax player Cole Pulice, \"Some shows, the people don't really know what to make of us at first. But they see us having a blast on stage, and I think that tells them we're all in this together to have a good time.\"\n\nThe Stillwater story hints at how an instrumental Afrobeat band somehow became a go-to favorite for the summer party scene in Minnesota -- a group whose music is based around the psychedelic-sounding, rhythmically complex, relatively obscure jazz\/funk\/fusion sounds of late Nigerian revolutionary Fela Kuti and the rest of his Afrobeat music movement.\n\nAmong the other outdoor fests that Black Market Brass has played this year were the Roots, Rock & Deep Blues Festival, the Twin Cities Jazz Festival, Art-a-Whirl at Bauhaus and the Coup d'\u00e9tat Block Party. The band has one more next weekend, the Borough Block Party outside Borough restaurant in Minneapolis' North Loop on Sunday (scheduled set time: 1 p.m.).\n\nQuipped the group's other guitarist, Mitch Sigurdson, \"We just show up to every block party and ask if we're playing.\"\n\nAlso the guitarist in the popular soul-rock sextet Black Diet, Sigurdson posted a Craigslist ad three years ago that became the big bang for BMB, asking if any other Twin Cities musicians were interested in forming an Afrobeat-flavored band. \"There were DJ nights and radios shows, but you couldn't really go hear this stuff played live anywhere in town,\" he recalled.\n\nHow a bunch of white, twenty- and thirty-something rock, jazz and soul musicians in Minnesota got into Afrobeat music in the first place is another surprise worth explaining.\n\nSome of them discovered it through modern Afrobeat acts such as the Antibalas Orchestra and Budos Band. Some were simply vinyl collectors who fell in love with the '70s-era worldbeat records reissued by Minneapolis label Secret Stash Records, which will also release Black Market Brass' debut album next spring.\n\nThe most well-versed among them was probably percussionist David Tullis, an African studies major at Carleton College who traveled to Nigeria on a fellowship-type excursion to study drumming. He can go on long tangents about the music's complex polyrhythms and other challenging elements.\n\n\"It's hard for a lot of musicians to find their place in this music because there's so much going on; everything is right there,\" said Tullis, who is also the drummer in Black Diet.\n\nSome of the first rehearsals for the bands were spent simply trying to work out musical charts from Kuti's music for guideposts. \"And then we still had to go through the long process of learning our own style and way of playing it,\" Sigurdson remembered.\n\nA true group effort\n\nAs scholarly as the band members can get about this music -- \"We really nerd out a lot in rehearsals,\" Kruger admitted -- they also make it clear they're in BMB primarily because it's fun music to play. Many of the songs in the band's growing bin of original tunes, including \"Snake Oil Man\" and \"Half a Cig,\" follow the same repetitive groove for six minutes or more but pick up steam via the feisty, fiery horn parts.\n\nPulice, who also performs with vintage soul greats Sonny Knight & the Lakers, said Afrobeat \"doesn't follow a normal western music narrative. It's not broken up into sections, or into solos, like jazz is.\n\n\"Good Afrobeat music is not about individual players. It's about what we can do together, and finding that sort of magical, hypnotic zone as one unit.\"\n\n\"Hypnotic\" could perhaps be taken as code for the heavy marijuana use associated with Afrobeat and reggae music. The band doesn't deny that there's an herbal undercurrent to the music, but Tullis pointed out, \"There are several people in the band who don't touch the stuff, and they do just fine.\n\n\"Really, it's about doing whatever you have to do to get in that uninhibited state where you freely dance to the music and just absorb it fully. Plenty of people can do that stone-cold sober.\"\n\nLet's hope that was true of those teens in Stillwater.","204":"Blackhawks fill out goaltending depth, but what about Corey Crawford?

The goaltending situation for next season is quickly taking shape at all levels, with Delia or Lankinen expected to be in big leagues, the other manning the crease in Rockford with Tomkins, and Aubrun possibly getting his feet wet with the Indy Fuel in the ECHL.\n\nRELATED: Blackhawks announce 4 signings\n\nWhich leaves us with the biggest question of them all: Corey Crawford, who's set to become an unrestricted free agent.\n\nIt's no secret the 35-year-old, two-time Stanley Cup champion wants to continue playing hockey, prefers to finish his career in Chicago and believes he can still be an everyday starter.\n\nCrawford certainly strengthened his case when he started 10 straight down the stretch and went 6-4-0 with a 2.41 goals against average, .930 save percentage and 6.17 goals saved above average before the NHL put its season on pause.\n\nBecause of the COVID-19 crisis, it's difficult to project what a fair deal between Crawford and the Blackhawks would be due to the uncertainty of what next season's salary cap could look like. However, it might mean both sides could be willing to come to an agreement on a shorter-term, team-friendly contract given that every other team in the league will be dealing with financial challenges as well.\n\nThe future of the 2019-20 season and whether the Stanley Cup will be awarded remains unclear, so there's not necessarily an urgency to figure it out right now. But the Blackhawks don't have a proven NHL starter among the four goalies currently under contract, which means filling the most important position appears to be the final order of business on the goaltending agenda after rounding out the rest of the group.\n\nAttention Dish and Sling customers!

No new issues were uncovered, but NASA managers said at the that time no decision had been made on whether a reflight might be required.\n\nThe Monday announcement said Boeing had \"chosen to refly our Orbital Flight Test to demonstrate the quality of the Starliner system.\"\n\n\"Flying another uncrewed flight will allow us to complete all flight test objectives and evaluate the performance of the second Starliner vehicle at no cost to the taxpayer,\" the company statement said. \"We will then proceed to the tremendous responsibility and privilege of flying astronauts to the International Space Station.\"\n\nA Boeing spokewoman said the capsule originally intended for the first piloted Starliner test flight will be used for the unpiloted reflight. She said Boeing is \"working with NASA to determine an agreeable schedule for the second OFT.\"\n\nWhile details still need to be worked out, she said in an email, \"we anticipate flying the mission in the Fall of 2020.\" That would appear to rule out a piloted Starliner flight in 2020, but no decisions have been announced on subsequent launch targets.\n\nBoeing and SpaceX are both building piloted astronaut ferry ships for NASA under commercial contracts valued at up to $6.8 billion. The goal is to end the agency's sole reliance on Russian Soyuz spacecraft to carry U.S. crews to and from the International Space Station.\n\nSpaceX carried out a successful unpiloted test flight of its Crew Dragon spacecraft last year and is gearing up for a second test flight, this one with two NASA astronauts on board, in the late May timeframe.\n\nIf that flight goes well, a second, operational Crew Dragon mission with four astronauts on board could be ready for takeoff by the end of July.\n\nBoeing had hoped to launch a crew this year as well -- but during the December OFT mission, a major software error, coupled with communications dropouts, prevented a planned rendezvous and docking with the space station.\n\nAnother software oversight could have caused a catastrophic failure during the capsule's re-entry, had it not been caught in time.\n\nDouglas Loverro, director of spaceflight at NASA Headquarters, told reporters in March the incidents had been classified as a \"high-visibility close call,\" a formal designation that kicks off additional government review. At that time, he said it was too soon to say whether a second test flight would be needed.\n\nBoeing told investors earlier that it was taking a $410 million charge against pre-tax earnings in large part to cover the possible cost of another test flight.\n\n\"For us, it's not that complicated,\" Jim Chilton, senior vice president at Boeing Space and Launch, said in March. \"Boeing stands ready to repeat an OFT (if required). ... There's not any intent on our part to avoid it. We just want to make sure that whatever we fly next is aligned with NASA's preferences. And of course for all of us, crew safety is number one.\"","206":"Boeing plans to retest Starliner flight after botched mission (Reuters) - Boeing Co said on Monday it would send its Starliner astronaut spacecraft on another unmanned mission to the International Space Station, months after its last flight was cut short because of a software bug.\n\nDuring the December test, a series of software glitches and an issue with the spacecraft's automated timer resulted in Starliner failing to dock at the space station and returning to Earth a week early.\n\nIn February, a NASA safety review panel found that Boeing had narrowly missed a \"catastrophic failure\" in the botched test, and recommended examining the company's software verification process before letting it fly humans to space.\n\nNASA officials held back on ordering a redo because they \"didn't think it would be sufficient\" to address all of the concerns raised in the safety review, an agency official told Reuters, adding that NASA would be making additional recommendations.\n\nBoeing and Elon Musk's rocket company, SpaceX, are separately building space taxis to ferry astronauts to the space station under NASA's effort to revive its human spaceflight program.\n\n\"Flying another uncrewed flight will allow us to complete all flight test objectives and evaluate the performance of the second Starliner vehicle at no cost to the taxpayer,\" the company said in a statement.","207":"Boeing says it'll redo uncrewed flight test of Starliner space taxi to space station Boeing says it will redo the uncrewed test flight of its Starliner space taxi to the International Space Station, after months of reviewing what went wrong during a flight that fell short of the mark.\n\nLast December's Starliner tryout, known as the Orbital Flight Test, failed to rendezvous with the space station when the craft's onboard flight software misread a timing cue and couldn't execute a crucial thruster burn properly. The mission was cut short, and the spacecraft landed autonomously two days after launch. Additional software lapses came to light during and after the mission, including communication dropouts as well as a glitch that could have ruined the craft's re-entry. That glitch was fixed with just hours to spare. An independent review found 61 corrective actions that needed to be taken. In today's statement, Boeing said a repeat of the flight would allow the Starliner team \"to complete all flight test objectives and evaluate the performance of the second Starliner vehicle at no cost to the taxpayer.\" Boeing has set aside $410 million to cover the cost of the reflight, which will set the stage for Starliner's first crewed flight.","208":"Boeing to refly failed Starliner space mission Boeing has announced that it will refly the failed unmanned first flight of its CST-100 Starliner spacecraft. The do-over of the December 2019 Orbital Test Flight will be paid for by Boeing and is aimed at fulfilling the test objectives that the shortened original mission was unable to complete.\n\nOn December 20, 2019, Boeing launched an unmanned version of the Starliner spacecraft that it is developing to ferry astronauts from American soil to the International Space Station (ISS), as well as serving private or international manned missions in low-Earth orbit. However, shortly after lifting off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida, a malfunction occurred that caused the craft's thrusters to misfire, wasting propellant and sending it into the wrong orbit.\n\nThe Starliner was brought back to Earth by ground controllers 48 hours later, making a soft, controlled landing at the US Army's White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. A subsequent investigation revealed that the accident was caused by two software failures that threw off the onboard Mission Elapsed Timer (MET) by 11 hours and caused the Service Module to improperly separate. These were exacerbated by the brief failure of the command and control link during launch, which prevented the Flight Control team from directly correcting the timer malfunction.\n\nBoeing has not announced when the new mission will take place, or how this will affect the scheduling of the first manned orbital mission of the Starliner.","209":"Books Briefing: The World Through a Surrealist Lens Strange worlds in strange times: Your weekly guide to the best in books\n\nDuring quarantine, the social limits of home confinement can impose a surreal texture to simple everyday experiences. Many authors are great at conceptualizing the illusory nature of reality in odd circumstances: They build fluid worlds that fuse time, place, and perception.\n\nMaisy Card's multigenerational debut novel, These Ghosts Are Family, uses the spirits of Caribbean folklore to weave together unreckoned colonial history with the fractured identities of present-day characters.

Most of the part-time and casual staff are young - still in school and still living with their parents.\n\nThe realisation that because of our jobs we might now be a health risk to our families, that we may be putting them in danger the second we step through the front door, is something that will inevitably weigh quite heavily on the mind.\n\nA friend of mine, a fellow 18-year-old checkout clerk living with someone who has an underlying health condition at home, is one who has been hit particularly hard by this. Unable to cook her own food and isolated from her family, her life now revolves around long work shifts and days spent in solitary in her room, hands red and raw from the excessive washing and use of latex gloves.\n\n* Life in the lockdown: How families in New Zealand are surviving close quarters\n\n* Now is the time to perfect your pantry\n\n* Sustainable wins from lockdown could become way of life\n\n* New online supermarket emerges to provide lockdown supplies\n\n* Man in court after coughing on Christchurch shoppers\n\n* Vulnerable shoppers and emergency services get preferential treatment at supermarkets\n\nThe idea that we are now among the valuable, the people in 'essential services' can be both exhilarating - knowing that we are at least able to help people in the scared population - but also exhausting.\n\nThis pandemic has rocked even the most hardened doctors and surgeons, so please try to imagine the pressure felt by under-prepared teenagers working at your local shop.\n\nSome of us were hopeful that the lockdown would reduce our risk by providing us with shorter lines and fewer people, we were sadly disappointed. By day two, I walked to work to find a line of customers stretching around the carpark before the store had even opened. The line only grew in the coming days, over 100 people standing in pouring rain, waiting to be let in by our new security guards; eager to once again panic-buy despite the assurances that we would stay open for the duration.\n\nBy the third day, the line had spilt out onto the street, resilient customers with jackets over their heads and bags under their arms, often ignoring the two metre distancing rules. Although the restrictions on numbers made things easy for us inside, the idea that there were dozens more people - dozens more risks - piling up outside the doors was frightening.\n\nAt one point, while I was collecting trolleys, I had a conversation with an eight-year-old boy through the fogged up window of a car who told me that his mother had been gone for two hours now; either waiting in the ever-growing line, or shopping. The idea of staying home was one meant to prevent the spread of infection, one where you could protect yourself and others just by staying on the couch. Cabin fever is understandable, but disbelief that this system is one that is going to save us is not.\n\nThe actions of the individual, the self-restraint and ability of being able to handle a little bit of boredom is something that might save not only your life, but the lives of these workers and their families. People who have abused our open doors in this time of crisis are, as one of my managers so aptly said while watching the line of people from our break room, \"bored at home, so they decided it would be fun to come here and risk the lives of our employees\".\n\nYet, despite these hurdles, I do want to applaud the outpouring of kindness we have gotten from people. There is always a smile, an encouraging word and some undying patience from our customers who smile from their surgical masks (and in one case, a full riot helmet).\n\nWe have been praised, thanked, and on occasion had some heart-warming comments sent to our managers about us. But the funniest thing to witness are the people working in the healthcare industry who have applauded our efforts. One man, a surgeon, talked to me for two minutes about how glad he and his family were that we were still open and operating and even told me how much respect he had for us as he left.\n\nSir: on the off chance you read this, please know it is people like you who deserve the respect and praise in our community for all the work you do, risking your lives to keep us healthy. If I could give you your groceries for free I would. But, for now all I can do is take precautions and stay home when I can - something I hope everyone else does too.","211":"Bottlebrush polymers in the melt and polyelectrolytes in solution share common structural features This article requires a subscription to view the full text. If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nBottlebrush polymer materials show great transdisciplinary promise, from tissue engineering to photonics. Homopolymers exhibit exceptionally low moduli while block brushes segregate into micrometer-sized domains. Both effects are attributed to the unique packing of brush polymers, a phenomenon that is difficult to measure without careful experimental design. Through precision synthesis and deuterium labeling, we studied a library of brush polymers in the melt using neutron scattering to quantitatively assess backbone packing. We show that bottlebrush polymers pack similarly to semidilute polyelectrolyte solutions, and that decreasing grafting density is analogous to increasing salt concentration in polyelectrolytes. These findings suggest hidden similarity in these different materials, one driven through sterics and the other through electrostatic repulsion.","212":"Braden Holtby sets franchise record for shutouts in blowout simulation win over Panthers By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy\n\nThe Capitals got plenty of offense in the latest NHL 20 simulation, but they didn't need it as Braden Holtby turned aside 36 shots to become the team's all-time shutout leader in a 5-0 blowout of the Florida Panthers on Saturday.\n\nResult: Caps 5, Panthers 0\n\n1st period\n\n1-0 Caps goal: Evgeny Kuznetsov from Alex Ovechkin and John Carlson\n\n2nd period\n\n2-0 Caps goal: Nicklas Backstrom from Nick Jensen and T.J.

Fast start\n\nWhat kind of a game was this going to be? We found in just 61 seconds as Kuznetsov wasted no time to get the Caps the lead. Washington would lead the rest of the way.\n\nCarlson charged the blue line to keep a loose puck from getting out of the zone. He passed it up to Ovechkin who made a quick backhand pass to Kuznetsov in the slot to score the goal.\n\n2. Possession\n\nFlorida somehow recorded 36 shots on goal, but did they ever really have possession of the puck in this game? It didn't feel like it. The Panthers had trouble defending against the Caps' offense as they struggled to keep the puck out of the defensive zone and struggled to get it out once it got there.\n\nFlorida also had no answer for Washington's physicality. The Caps threw their bodies around all game long to separate the Panthers from the puck and Florida just took it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SUBSCRIBE TO THE CAPITALS TALK PODCAST\n\n3. A long-awaited shutout\n\nIt's been a long time coming. Holtby had not recorded a shutout all season long and finally got one in the final game of the regular season with 36 saves. The shutout is the 36th of Holtby's career, which gives Holtby the most in franchise history, moving him one ahead of Olie Kolzig. Or it would have of course if it was not a simulation.\n\nIn the few opportunities in which Florida did manage to keep the puck long enough to set up its offense, Holtby was there and gave the Panthers no daylight with which to shoot on.\n\nNext game\n\nThis was the final game of the regular season.

I thought, 'This is pretty cool.'\u202f\"\n\nReally, Nick ... you didn't know? Anderson showed what was immediately perceived to be a world-class wry smile and said: \"I hadn't been paying much attention to the standings in Miami.\"\n\nAnderson's initial lack of Rays awareness was mentioned to Ethan Imdieke and drew a laugh. \"That sounds exactly like Nick,\" Imdieke said. \"It's the hitter and him. He doesn't worry about the rest of it.\"\n\nEthan and his father, Tom, have been running the Tri-City Shark, a Class A amateur team in the St. Paul suburbs, since 2009. Tom also was the operator of Line Drive Sports, a now-closed baseball and softball training center in Lino Lakes.\n\nAnderson had pitched the summers of 2012 and '13 for Rockford, Ill., in the independent Frontier League. He had woeful ERAs of 7.71 and 6.42. He also was on probation for an assault charge from an alcohol-fueled brawl.\n\nTwo pro seasons with inflated ERAs. Both a drunken driving charge and later the assault rap, presumably the reason the Brewers didn't sign Anderson after drafting him in the 32nd round in 2012 out of Mayville (N.D.) State.\n\nA friend in the Twin Cities hired Nick to help remodel homes, and in the winter of 2013-14, it looked as if that might be his occupational future.\n\n\"Nick started training at my dad's place,\" Ethan Imdieke said. \"He hadn't given up on baseball. He hadn't given up on himself. He had nothing lined up for that season, so we said, 'Pitch for us until something else comes up. Nothing did.' \"\n\nAnderson pitched for the Tri-City Shark for the entire 2014 schedule. Ethan and Matt Tetrick were the catchers.\n\n\"Excellent fastball and a hard curveball, 12 to 6, drops straight down, quickly,\" Imdieke said. \"He had 16 strikeouts in seven innings in one game.\"\n\nIn August, Anderson was back in Mayville for a golf tournament, a fundraiser for the baseball program. He drove back from North Dakota and then pitched for the Shark against Red Rooster in a playoff game.\n\n\"I don't think Nick had a full night's sleep,\" Ethan Imdieke said. \"He pitched his worst game for us and we got beat. Walked eight, which might have been more than he had walked all season.\"\n\nThose were substantially more walks than Anderson permitted after the trade to the Rays. He pitched in 27 games for Tampa Bay -- including four in the postseason -- with 49 strikeouts and two walks in 27 innings.\n\nThe Rays went 34-18 after the trade, claimed the second wild card, and then Anderson's profile was raised substantially in the one-game showdown at Oakland. He was used as the opener, faced five batters, struck out four, gave up one hit, and started the Rays to a 5-1 victory.\n\nSpeculation is Anderson will be the Tampa Bay closer to start 2020. Kevin Cash was asked if he planned to use Nick \"late, setup or middle\" and the Rays manager said:\n\n\"When it matters. How about that?\"\n\nAnderson's resiliency led him from the Shark to the Greys, a Frontier League traveling team in 2015, where Twins scout Billy Milos watched him four times and successfully pleaded with his bosses to sign him.\n\nWhen Nick broke through with a tremendous minor league season at Class AAA Rochester in 2018, the Twins' new brain trust mysteriously traded him to Miami for nonprospect infielder Brian Schales in November, and Anderson became a rookie strikeout phenom with two Florida teams.\n\nWhat happened the past three years? Shrug, wry smile and Anderson said: \"Just started throwing harder. I was always tall and skinny. I grew into my body, I guess.\"\n\nEthan Imdieke was in Orlando this week and talked with Anderson on the phone. He had pitched only twice this spring, and Anderson had overheard Cash saying the plan was to \"save his bullets\" for the regular season.\n\n\"Nick said, 'I don't want to save bullets; I want to pitch,' \" Imdieke said. \"That's Nick. After what he went through to get here, he just wants to pitch.\"\n\nWrite to Patrick Reusse by e-mailing sports@startribune.com and including his name in the subject line.","214":"Breaking Down 'Sister Wives' Star Meri Brown's Catfish Scandal The Duggars Won't Stop Wearing Pants Because Nothing Is Sacred Anymore\n\nIn 2015, Sister Wives star Meri Brown was caught in a catfish scandal. While the drama played out in several seasons of the hit TLC reality show, many fans are still confused about what happened between Meri and a man named \"Sam Cooper.\"\n\nMeri's relationship with \"Sam\" -- whom she met on Twitter -- kicked off in March 2015, not long after the Flagstaff, Arizona resident divorced her husband, Kody Brown, so that he could legally marry his fourth wife, Robyn Brown. Well, after six months of online communication, Meri's romance with \"Sam\" came to a sudden halt after she discovered that her Internet lover was actually a woman named Jackie Overton.\n\nJackie -- an infamous online scammer -- tricked Meri into falling in love with her by pretending to be \"Sam,\" a business tycoon in his early 40s. After flirting publicly via Twitter, Meri and \"Sam\" (a.k.a. Jackie) started to chat privately on the phone. Meri even sent \"Sam\" naughty text messages, which Jackie later leaked, that included images of the TLC personality posing seductively with a banana.\n\nOnce Meri discovered that \"Sam\" was Jackie in August 2015, she was understandably devastated. In retaliation to Meri ending their relationship, \"Sam\" -- who insisted their romance was the real deal -- exposed the reality star's sexts and private voicemails via \"his\" blog. \"Sam\" went so far as to write a book titled Almost Meri'ed, which was later made available on Amazon.\n\nAs seen on 2016's season 7 of Sister Wives, Meri -- who shares daughter Mariah with Kody -- revealed how being catfished affected her family life. \"This catfish was just planting things in my head an telling me how horrible my family was and specifically how horrible Kody was,\" Meri said on the show. \"That was one of the reasons why I didn't want him around. I was just angry. I'm just angry at him. I just pushed Kody away. I did. He's not the one I should've pushed away.\"\n\nEven though the catfishing scandal happened in the past, it still comes up in discussion during Meri and Kody's marriage counseling sessions as they try to repair the damage in their relationship.","215":"Brett Lee Compares Six-Year-Old Girl To Sachin Tendulkar.

For the hosts, it will be their sixth successive appearance in the T20 World Cup final, having made the showpiece clash in every edition since 2010. And this time, they're bidding for a record-extending fifth T20 World Cup title. As for India, they have never previously made it to the Women's T20 World Cup final, looking to become just the fourth side -- after Australia, England and the West Indies -- to be crowned T20 world champions.\n\n\"With two incredible teams in front of a huge crowd at the MCG, Sunday will probably go down as one of the biggest days in women's sport and I really can't wait for it to unfold,\" wrote Brett Lee in his column for ICC.\n\n\"Usually ahead of a final there's a favourite and an underdog but I think it's so hard to separate these teams.\n\n\"Australia are four-time champions and know what it takes to play on home soil while India have won every game so far.\n\n\"But playing in a major final is unlike anything else -- you can't compare it to any other cricket match so Australia's experience of playing in those big matches could be so important,\" he added.\n\nIndia defeated Australia in the tournament opener last month in Sydney and since then have gone undefeated to make it to their maiden T20 World Cup final.\n\nHowever, Lee feels that Australia, having featured in the final on a number of occasions, have the advantage of experience when they take on the field in front of what is expected to be full-house at the MCG.\n\n\"Meg Lanning and her side may have lost that first match but the way they have come back since has been brilliant,\" said Lee.\n\n\"To know that you can't make any more mistakes -- in a tournament where their expectation and pressure is greater than ever -- takes a lot of character and they've shown that in their team.\n\n\"They were beaten by the better India team on the day but they haven't looked back since, the batters and bowlers have both delivered and stood up for their country when needed.\n\n\"As an Australian, I'd love nothing more than for Lanning's team to do the job,\" he added.\n\nThe former Australian speedster, however, feels if India manage to win the World Cup, it would do much for women's cricket in a country that already adores the sport.\n\nAnd for that to happen, Lee believes Shafali Verma holds the key for the Indian team. Shafali, the No.1 ranked T20I batswoman, has been instrumental in India's prowess in the ongoing tournament.\n\nHer scores reading 29, 39, 46 and 47 have improved with each game and she would once again hold the key for the team against the mighty Aussies.\n\n\"In Shafali Verma, India boast one of the most talented players in the world and you feel that for Australia to win the game, dismissing her will likely be their first job,\" said Lee.\n\n\"I've been so impressed with the opener - it's staggering to believe she's only 16 with the confidence she has in her own ability and the way she strikes the ball so cleanly.\n\n\"She's such good fun to watch and I'm not sure the women's game has seen anyone like her for such a long time. To be the world's best T20 batter already shows just how far she has progressed in such a short space of time and the experience in this tournament will hold her in good stead for years to come.\n\n\"Even with the way she's played in Australia and her fearless brand of cricket, you still get the feeling she has more to come as well. She's got a big score in her locker and there's probably no better place to do that than the MCG,\" he added.\n\nShafali is already a record breaker but if she can steer her side to their first Women's T20 World Cup title at just 16, then the sky really is the limit for her career.","217":"Brian Lara Not Concerned With Duration Of Test, Wants Result | Cricket News West Indian batting legend Brian Lara is not concerned about the duration of Test matches as long as they are producing results. Lara, who holds the record for the highest individual score in Tests (400 not out), also said that the Day-Night Tests were an \"attraction\" but not the way forward to popularise the longest format of the game. Asked about his take on four-day or five-day Tests, Lara told PTI, \"My only (thing) from Test cricket is that everyone that watches cricket knows the game is going to end in a result, that in itself will peak in interest.\"\n\n\"If it is five days, four days, it doesn't matter. If every game is going to end in a result in someway or some form, I think the interest is going to be created on the first day, on the last day, as long as people know that,\" added Lara, who has a staggering 11,953 Test runs from 131 matches.\n\nLara, who is leading the West Indies Legends in the Road Safety World Series, spoke on the sidelines of a training session in Mumbai.\n\nIconic batsman Sachin Tendulkar and India skipper Virat Kohli have openly come out in support of having five-day Tests. The stylish left-hander, also a former West Indies captain, stressed that a result would keep people's interest in the longer format of the game.\n\n\"You listen to (an) American talk, that is something we hear always, you play for five days and sometimes you don't have a winner, that could be a little bit of (an issue). A winner in every game should be possible,\" he added.\n\nThe BCCI last year finally embraced Day\/Night Tests, following which India played Bangladesh in Kolkata.\n\n\"I think it (Day\/Night Tests) is an attraction, but I don't think it is a way forward (for) the game. I don't think that's going to bring anybody back. I think it (Test cricket) is something that has gone away from couple of generations and we need to get it back from a very early age.\n\n\"May be the ICC or Governing Body is shifting towards T20, may be little bit less concerned about Test cricket, but that is their modus operandi and I have no clue. I just know for me when you see a good Test match it is very special,\" he said.","218":"Brian O'Neill gets an extra $441K, tops Vikings' earners in performance-based pay In his second year with the Vikings, right tackle Brian O'Neill established himself as a fixture of the team's offensive line for years to come.\n\nIn his second year with the Vikings, right tackle Brian O'Neill established himself as a fixture of the team's offensive line for years to come. He also earned himself a substantial raise through the NFL's performance-based pay program.\n\nO'Neill, who played all but eight snaps in the 15 regular-season games where the Vikings used their starters, earned a combined $441,753.31 from the program, collecting $254,399.43 from a pool of money available to both rookies and veterans and another $187,353.88 from a pool available only to veterans. The league's program is designed to reward players whose importance to their team -- as a function of their playing time -- outstrips the value of their contract. O'Neill, who was playing in the second year of his rookie deal, had a base salary of $680,302 in 2019.\n\nThe tackle got the second-most money from the pool available to rookies and veterans, coming in behind wide receiver Bisi Johnson (who got $288,197.61 after playing nearly 42 percent of the team's offensive snaps). O'Neill was also the Vikings' second-highest earner in the pool available to both rookies and veterans, coming in behind guard Pat Elflein, who received $190,797.44.\n\nIn the pool available to both rookies and veterans, linebacker Eric Wilson ($236,131.62), Elflein ($232,388.08) and fullback C.J. Ham ($222,000.38) rounded out the Vikings' top five.\n\nWilson ($148,566.51), Ham ($139,425.36) and defensive end Stephen Weatherly ($129,289.94) joined Elflein and O'Neill as the Vikings' top earners from the veterans-only pool.\n\nEach team in the NFL was allocated $4.623 million for its rookies and veterans, and another $2.6 million to divide among its veterans, with all amounts determined by an index based on salary cap figures and playing time.\n\nThe program is designed to reward even the league's highest-paid players with a little extra walking-around money for their effort during the season. Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins, who played on a base salary of $27.5 million last season, got an extra $16,270.09 from the two pools ($8,259.57 from the rookies-and-veterans pool and $8,010.52 from the veterans only pool).","219":"Brickbat: Heck of a Job, Hendrex A arbitrator has ordered the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department to reinstate an officer fired for hesitating to respond to a mass shooting at the Mandalay Bay casino in 2017.

Beginners are taught to play \"second hand low,\" a tendency with a logical basis.\n\nToday's South plays at four hearts after showing a strong hand with a second-round jump-shift. West finds the good opening lead of a trump. Declarer wins in dummy and leads the singleton spade. How should East defend?\n\nSPADE LOSER\n\nThis may seem like a time to ignore \"second hand low,\" but East should play low. East won't lose his ace if he ducks: South can ruff at most two spades in dummy and will still have a spade to lose.\n\nIf East plays low, South will probably finesse with the jack. West wins and leads another trump, and East will eventually get two spade tricks and a club. If East grabs the first spade, South can set up his spades with one ruff and score game.\n\nConsider with care whether to play \"second hand low.\"\n\nDAILY QUESTION\n\nYou hold: S A 10 6 4 H 4 2 D Q J 5 3 C A 10 8. Your partner opens one heart, you bid one spade, he rebids two hearts and you try 2NT. Partner then bids three diamonds. What do you say?\n\nANSWER: Partner's bidding suggests six hearts, four diamonds and minimum opening values. Your hand has become quite strong. Your diamond honors are \"working,\" and your aces will cover some of partner's black-suit losers. Make sure of game. Bid four hearts or five diamonds.","222":"Bridge: March 22, 2020 \"Do you believe in miracles?\" Unlucky Louie asked me in the club lounge.\n\n\"Jesus is said to have turned water into wine at that wedding in Cana,\" I replied.\n\n\"Sometimes when I'm at McDonald's,\" Cy the Cynic offered, \"and the girl behind the counter isn't looking, I turn water into Sprite.\"\n\n\"How about turning four losers into three?\" Louie asked.\n\nIn a penny game, Louie was declarer at today's four hearts, and West led a diamond. Louie won with dummy's king, led a trump to his king and continued with the queen. East took the ace and returned a diamond, and Louie won and cashed his jack of trumps.\n\nWhen West discarded, Louie led a third diamond, hoping for a 3-3 break and a discard for his losing spade. But West won, and East showed out, and Louie had to lose a spade plus a trump to East's ten. Down one.\n\n\"No miracles when I'm declarer,\" Louie sighed.\n\nIt shouldn't take a miracle worker to make the contract. All declarer must do is take 10 winners, compressing his four losers into three. He can win the first diamond in his hand, take the ace of clubs, ruff a club and lead the king of trumps to East's ace. Declarer wins the diamond return in dummy, ruffs a club and takes the Q-J of trumps.\n\nWhen West discards, South cashes the K-A of spades. Having won nine tricks, he leads dummy's last club. No matter what East does, South is sure to score his last low trump. The defenders' three remaining tricks -- a trump, a diamond and a spade -- clash on the last two tricks.","223":"Bridge: March 23, 2020 \"Time flies. It's up to you to be the navigator.\" -- graffiti\n\nWhen you're declarer, making your contract may require timing the play correctly. Good timing starts at the first trick, but some players, alas, are inclined to play first and then think.\n\nIn today's deal, South's two clubs showed a game-going hand, which he certainly had, not necessarily with clubs. His leap to six spades was rash. How he expected to cope with his losing hearts is a mystery.\n\nCLUB LOSER\n\nWhen West led the king of diamonds, South hastily took dummy's ace to pitch his club loser. He then drew trumps -- and cashed lots more trumps. West clung to his hearts, and South lost two hearts at the end.\n\nSouth navigated off course at Trick One. He must play a low diamond from dummy and ruff in his hand. South draws trumps, takes the A-K of hearts and leads a club to dummy's king.\n\nEast is helpless. If he plays low, South has 12 tricks. If East takes the ace, he must lead to dummy, yielding the slam.\n\nDAILY QUESTION\n\nYou hold: S 4 2 H 6 3 D A 7 6 3 C K Q 10 6 3. Your partner opens one spade, you respond 1NT and he bids two hearts. The opponents pass. What do you say?\n\nANSWER: If your hand were slightly stronger -- you had a super-maximum 1NT response -- you could bid 2NT to try for game. As it is, bid two spades. If your partner has extra strength, he can bid again. If he has a minimum, two spades on a 5-2 fit is likely to be your best contract.","224":"Bridge: March 30, 2020 Trump extends virus guidelines, braces US for big death toll that could hit 100,000\n\nCy the Cynic denies that he's lazy; he says he exists in energy-saving mode.

The Cynic next drew trumps and let the ten of clubs ride. East took the queen and led another spade, forcing out Cy's king, and when East won the next club, the defense cashed a spade. Down one.\n\nLOSERS\n\nCy needed to save his mental energy for another deal. He starts with four potential losers: a trump, a spade and two clubs. Cy can set up a club winner in dummy for a spade discard but must do so promptly, lest the defenders win the race by setting up a spade trick.\n\nThe Cynic can't afford to start the trumps at Trick Two; he must lead a club from dummy. East takes the queen and shifts to a spade, but Cy wins with the king and leads the ten of clubs to East's ace. Cy wins the next spade and throws his spade loser on a high club.\n\nDAILY QUESTION\n\nYou hold: S A 6 5 4 H K 9 3 2 D A C K J 4 3. Both sides vulnerable. The dealer, at your right, opens one club. What do you say?\n\nANSWER: It's quite annoying when an opponent steals your opening bid. A possible call is to pass and hope to act later, but you may never have an appropriate chance. A few experts would overcall 1NT despite the unbalanced pattern. I believe most would risk a double, hoping (praying) for a major-suit response from partner.","225":"Bridge: March 31, 2020 Coronavirus: Santa Clara County reports 202 new COVID-19 cases, cites 'reporting delay'\n\n\"The marriage vows should be retitled 'terms of service,'\" a club player told me sourly. \"When my husband and I play, I'm always trying to figure out what he wants me to do.

Otherwise, he will have the option of passing. Indeed, a response of 2NT (if forcing) would have been a possible action at your first turn.","226":"Brighten Your Day Giveaway #1: Two PW Instant Pots UPDATE: The winners of the Pioneer Woman Instant Pots are:\n\n1.

So far, the remaking of the Twins has the feel of reassembling a hair band that used to play arena shows and sending it on a casino tour. First, the manager. Then, some of the coaches. Now, Torii Hunter, returning to the city that loved him as a young player and lamented his departure via free agency for California around this time seven years ago.\n\nIn our house last night, amid both skepticism and excitement, we wondered who else the Twins would bring back. It was a five-minute parlor game that fortunately never got as far as mentioning Tony Batista, but that's how we greeted the news. On social media, it turned the night angry in some of the discussions between supporters and detractors of the deal.\n\nFrom those who have worked the Twins clubhouse since the terrible years started, one of the themes has been of a lost clubhouse that suffered for lack of personality. As Jim Souhan points out in his column, Hunter, Guardado and Paul Molitor will create change there.\n\nFrom those whose following of the game includes advanced defensive metrics, adding Hunter to right field and moving the defensively suspect Oswaldo Arcia to left doesn't do anything to help a team that has been suffering for its outfield defense. The blogger Parker Hageman offers this breakdown of Hunter's defense, which has certainly broken down from his days as an elite center fielder. Current numbers speak in ways that counter what we remember from a decade ago.\n\nThe best case for the Hunter signing is that it combines the joy of bringing back someone of whom we were pretty much unconditionally fond with the pain of knowing that bringing him back doesn't help on the field. And considering we're talking about someone who will turn 40 during the 2015 season, it has the potential to be an even greater liability than it looks right now.\n\nBy the way, I'm dismissing those who think that Hunter has given up on his dream of playing for a World Series team. If the Twins are what we think they'll be, Hunter is a best bet to end up with a contender come the trading deadlines. I'd argue that coming to Minnesota actually increases his chances of reaching that goal.\n\nI'm also not at all concerned about the $10.5 million salary. Last time I checked, Twins ownership is pretty deep pocketed. End of that discussion here.\n\nThe bigger issue is: What else? Do the Twins think they can sell a reunion tour of a manager, coaches and a past-his-prime player as acceptable baseball, even when combined with the promise of those talented young players working their way through the minor-league system (when they're not injured or serving drug suspensions)? So far, including the just-announced plans for a new bar and megasuite, the Twins are spending their energy at the cosmetics counter.\n\nOver the next few weeks as free agency boils up and the next few months as Terry Ryan shapes the team for the season, the Twins need to move to the meat counter and make moves intended to create hope for 2015. In his press conference after signing on as manager, Molitor talked about having little interest in selling the future. It was nice to hear that, but what was he supposed to say? \"I'm good with carrying on the failed policies of the previous administration.\"\n\nI'm patient enough to know that the Twins as constituted on December 3 will not be the same as the team training Florida on March 3 or the team preparing for its opener in Detroit a month later.\n\nI'm also frustrated enough to be annoyed by the half-measures and failed measures that have been taken to ready the Twins for recent seasons -- everything from the Nishioka-for-Hardy idea that marked the beginning of the slide in 2011 to the embarrassing roster construction with which the Twins entered last season.\n\nWhen I think about the Twins, I hear Herb Brooks telling me \"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me,\" in my left ear and Great White singing \"Once Bitten, Twice Shy,\" in my right.\n\nThe Twins need to show us something more off the field that will give fans hope for a better product on the field in 2015. Torii Hunter's presence may well improve the team's make-up and be a great thing for sportswriters.","230":"Britain is a nation of pet lovers - and it has the Victorians to thank The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations\n\nBritain was the first country in the world to start a welfare charity for animals, as early as 1824. Now, almost 20m cats and dogs have a loving place in the country's homes, and almost one in two households is accompanied by a furry, scaly, or feathered friend.\n\nAs a historian of family and home life in 19th- and 20th-century Britain, I've been trying to find out how this came about. With Julie-Marie Strange and our research team, Luke Kelly, Lesley Hoskins and Rebecca Preston, we've been exploring archives from the Victorian era and beyond to figure out how and when pets became so prominent in family life.\n\nHumans have interacted and engaged with animals for thousands of years, but pet-keeping didn't become socially acceptable in Britain until the 18th century. Until then, pets were often seen as an elite extravagance, and small dogs frequently appeared in satirical prints of aristocratic ladies, symbolising frivolity and indulgence.\n\nBy the late 18th and early 19th centuries there were fewer of these kinds of images. Instead, paintings and illustrations - a good indicator of what was culturally \"in\" - began to portray pets as an accepted part of domestic life.\n\nIn part, this was because of the new emphasis Victorians placed on home and domestic life. Responding to the growth of noisy and dirty industrial cities, Victorians began to idealise the home as a sacrosanct space. Pets were a key part of this celebration of domestic life, appearing in numerous paintings and illustrations and often portrayed as part of the family. This was the clear message behind Frederick George Cotman's painting, One of the Family, which shows a rural family at the dinner table, accompanied by a pet dog and a horse.\n\nIn tandem, a rising Evangelical religious movement placed more emphasis on mothers and fathers in bringing up moral children. In this cultural climate, pet keeping took on a new moral value. From the 1840s, advice books and children's literature encouraged children to keep small animals such as rabbits, guinea pigs and birds. The idea was to cultivate commitment, caring values and practical skills. Boys in particular were expected to learn kindness from these activities.\n\nVictorians kept pets for a variety of reasons. Pedigree dogs conveyed class and status, cats caught mice, and rabbits could be eaten when times were hard. But evidence from interviews, diaries, photographs and the numerous newly created pet cemeteries suggests that, above all, emotional attachment was a crucial part of the relationship between most Victorians and their pets.\n\nDogs, for example, were held to have virtuous characteristics that echoed the values of the Victorian human world - they were seen as steadfast, loyal and courageous. In the popular painting by Briton Riviere to the right, a little girl, perhaps banished to the naughty step, is accompanied by a faithful dog.\n\nNot all rosy\n\nWhile the Victorians celebrated pets, there was less consciousness of the harm that might be caused to animals by removing them from their natural habits. Mice, rabbits, squirrels, hedgehogs and all kinds of British birds regularly featured in advice manuals as animals that could be captured and tamed.\n\nHedgehogs, for example, were frequently captured and sold at London's Leadenhall Market. Their willingness to eat black beetles made them valuable in London kitchens as they were thought to improve cleanliness. But as how to care for and feed them was not well understood, they tended not to survive for long.\n\nBirds played an important part in working class culture. Though some families kept them in poor conditions, most cared for them fondly, valuing the song, movement, and colour they added to home life. Removing them from the wild was more contentious than other animals - in the 1870s, legislation was passed to limit their capture to certain times of year. However, markets trading in wild birds continued to operate well into the 20th century.\n\nA new century, a new relationship\n\nTaking animals directly from the wild became gradually less acceptable in the 20th century. Changes in living conditions in the early 20th century also altered the way people kept domesticated pets. The building of new suburban houses with larger gardens in the interwar period created a new, more spacious environment for animals. An increasing urban population was encouraged to take in pets that didn't mind living exclusively indoors, such as pedigree cats.\n\nDisposable incomes rose, so there was also more money for people to spend on their companions. After the Second World War, vet services grew, as did companies supplying bespoke food, toys and pampering experiences.\n\nA stronger emphasis developed on building a relationship with pets, rather than simply caring for them. From the 1920s, commentators increasingly wrote of relationships between humans and pets, and of training as an important facet of dog ownership.\n\nBy the 1950s, popular animal experts like Barbara Woodhouse were emphasising that owners also had to be trained. Woodhouse argued that \"delinquent canines\" - dogs that stole Sunday joints, occupied the favourite chairs of owners, or refused to move from their beds - were due to the failings of owners who had not forged meaningful relationships with them.\n\nBy the late 1950s and early 1960s, academics had started exploring the significance of pets in family life. Sociologists Harold Bridger and Stephanie White argued in 1964 that the decline of the traditional \"close-knit\" family made pets more necessary to bind families together. They predicted that pets would keep becoming more popular long into the future. The booming pet culture in the 21st century appears to fulfil that prophecy.","231":"British Police Drop Manslaughter Charge In Emiliano Sala Crash | Football News No further action will be taken against a man arrested on suspicion of manslaughter over the death of Argentine footballer Emiliano Sala, British police said on Wednesday. Sala, 28, was killed when a plane carrying him and pilot David Ibbotson came down in the Channel on January 21 last year, just days after he had joined Cardiff City from French side Nantes. In June last year Dorset Police arrested a 64-year-old man from North Yorkshire in northern England on suspicion of manslaughter by an unspecified unlawful act.\n\nBut Detective Inspector Simon Huxter said police \"will not be seeking a formal charging decision... in relation to homicide offences\".\n\nThe man arrested \"will not be subject of further action with regard to that offence\", he said in a statement, adding that a Civil Aviation Authority investigation continued.\n\nSala had been the then-Premier League side Cardiff's record signing after a fee of 15 million pound ($19 million, 17-million-euro) fee was agreed with Nantes.\n\nThe footballer travelled to the Welsh capital to complete the deal, then returned to northwest France to collect belongings and bid farewell to teammates.\n\nHis plane, piloted by Ibbotson, vanished from radar off the Channel island of Guernsey, as he returned to Cardiff to take part in his first training session.\n\nHis body was later recovered from the wreckage of the single-propeller Piper PA-46 Malibu plane as part of a private, crowd-funded search but Ibbotson's corpse has still not been found.\n\nSince then, the two clubs have been involved in a legal wrangle over the transfer fee. Cardiff has also expressed dismay at reports the pilot was not licenced to fly at night.\n\nBritain's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) is due to publish its final report into the crash on Friday.\n\nIn August last year, the AAIB said Sala and Ibbotson -- who were the only people on board the plane -- were likely to have been exposed to \"potentially fatal\" levels of carbon monoxide.\n\nExposure at such levels \"can reduce or inhibit a pilot's ability to fly an aircraft depending on the level of that exposure\", it added.","232":"Brusdar Graterol, Kenta Maeda in limbo as snag hits Betts-Price blockbuster deal * The Red Sox, eager to unload salary and get under the luxury tax threshold, are trying to send 2018 American League MVP Mookie Betts and All-Star lefthander David Price to the Dodgers. Betts, due $27 million in 2020, will be a free agent following the season. Price has three years and $96 million left on his contract.\n\n* The Dodgers gave up young outfielder Alex Verdugo, who missed the final two months of last season because of core muscle issues, to the Red Sox.\n\n* To make the deal work, Los Angeles proposed sending starting pitcher Kenta Maeda to the Twins, who then would dispatch 21-year-old top pitching prospect Brusdar Graterol to the Red Sox. Graterol made his major league debut last season. The Twins were projecting him as a reliever, although the Red Sox eyed him as a future starter.\n\nThe snag:\n\n* A major league source has confirmed the Red Sox, after viewing Graterol's medical records, put a delay in the trade. It is unclear if they would like more compensation from the Twins or the Dodgers. Verdugo's medical issues are not a problem.\n\n* The commissioner's office must approve the trade because the Red Sox intend to pay a large part of Price's salary.\n\nThe issue:\n\n* Graterol missed 2\u00bd months last season because of a shoulder impingement. He also had elbow surgery in 2016 that sidelined him for 15 months as a teenager, but he returned in 2017 with a fastball that hit 100 mph. He pitched 102 innings in 2018 and 61 in 2019 ... as a starter, he'd have to increase that to around 200 innings. If the Red Sox feel he's a reliever, not a starter, that could make him less valuable in the deal.\n\n* And ... the Red Sox are being savaged by media and fans for giving up on the 2020 season. The team is under investigation for alleged sign stealing under manager Alex Cora, who was fired last month. Boston is without a manager as spring training begins next week.\n\nThe tentacles:\n\n* After believing they were acquiring Betts, the Dodgers sent outfielder Joc Pederson and All-Star pitcher Ross Stripling to the Angels for young second baseman Luis Rengifo (with other prospects on both sides reportedly involved). That deal has not been made official yet either; Pederson has an arbitration hearing decision due today that will clear up his salary number.\n\nSolution?\n\n* We'll probably find out soon if either the Twins or Dodgers have to pony up another prospect or if the trade will fall through. There have been some big-name trades that almost happened, and some that fell through because of medical issues.\n\n* Graterol remains in limbo in Fort Myers. None of the players involved have been notified of the trade by their teams.\n\n* If the deal does fall apart -- which most people think unlikely -- would the Twins feel obligated to add another prospect in the mix, or simply say \"Hey, we'll keep Graterol then,\" and walk away?","233":"Buccaneers' Shaq Barrett shows off his basketball skills The Tampa Bay Buccaneers avoided losing Pro Bowl pass rusher Shaq Barrett this offseason.

The home side were dominant in the first half at Turf Moor, taking the lead through Chris Wood, but a much-improved Spurs battled back after the break to avoid a damaging third straight defeat. Sean Dyche's men, who were in relegation trouble as recently as January, are now unbeaten in seven league games but will rue missing the chance to clamber above Spurs.\n\nThe draw leaves Tottenham in eighth place, just four points behind fourth-placed Chelsea, who play on Sunday, and two behind fifth-placed Wolves. Burnley are a further two points adrift.\n\nFifth spot could be enough to secure Champions League football next season depending on the outcome of Manchester City's appeal against their European ban.\n\n\"There was a lot of aggression at half-time, we knew we were not good enough,\" Alli told Sky Sports.\n\n\"If you switch off for a second they can punish you. Going in at half time 1-0 down, it was a sticky changing room to be. But we did better and created enough opportunities to win.\"\n\nSpurs, again without the injured Harry Kane and Son Heung-min, started brightly but Burnley were quickly into their stride and deservedly took the lead in the 13th minute.\n\nJay Rodriguez shot straight at Hugo Lloris from the edge of the box but the Tottenham goalkeeper spilled the shot and Wood pounced to tap home the rebound.\n\nBurnley continued to carry more of a threat, regularly unsettling the Spurs defence and Dwight McNeil forced a flying save from Lloris from a free-kick.\n\nAshley Westwood fired wide eight minutes before the break while Wood was narrowly off target from Westwood's free-kick.\n\nSpurs changes\n\nMourinho made two substitutions at half-time to lift his flat team, bringing on Lucas Moura and Giovani Lo Celso for Oliver Skipp and Tanguy Ndombele.\n\nThe Spurs boss was strongly critical of midfielder Ndombele, who arrived from Lyon for a club-record 60 million euros ($68 million, 52 million pounds) last year.\n\n\"He's a player with great talent,\" said Mourinho. \"He has to know he has to do much better and know I cannot keep giving him opportunities to play because the team is much more important.\"\n\nThe visitors were given a lifeline when Ben Mee clumsily tripped Erik Lamela in the 48th minute.\n\nAlli stepped up and sent Burnley goalkeeper Nick Pope the wrong way, burying the ball in the bottom right corner.\n\nThe goal lifted Spurs, who were suddenly playing with more confidence but Burnley's players believed they had a case for a penalty minutes later when Davinson Sanchez made a robust challenge on Wood.\n\nThere were chances for both sides as the second half wore on.\n\nWood shot straight at Lloris while Lo Celso curled just wide at the other end. Minutes later Burnley substitute Matej Vydra saw his close-range shot saved by the sprawling Spurs goalkeeper as they pushed for the winner.\n\nDyche was happy with his side's performance, despite the disappointment of conceding an equaliser.\n\n\"A very rare mistake from Ben Mee and you wonder how it would affect things, but we gripped the game and I was really pleased with it,\" he said.\n\n\"We build slowly, we are not the real deal yet.

The injury was originally diagnosed as a dislocation, but a hand specialist discovered the fracture.\n\nBuxton and the Twins had hoped the fracture would heal without operating, but after additional consultation, Twins' minor-league director Brad Steil confirmed Friday, the decision was made to place the pin inside the finger, a procedure which took place Thursday morning in Arizona.\n\nThe damage wasn't as bad as doctors feared, which could speed up his return. Buxton has been told to rest his left hand while it heals, which will limit his ability to swing a bat this winter. But doctors expect him to be able to resume training for the 2015 season by January, well before Twins' camp opens in February.\n\nThe 20-year-old center fielder appeared in 13 AFL games with the Salt River Rafters, hoping to salvage some playing time after an injury-plagued 2014 season. He was batting .263 with five stolen bases when he was injured.\n\nIt's the third injury that Buxton has sustained while diving for fly balls this season. He severely sprained his left wrist on a similar play during the end of training camp last March, costing him nearly three months, and he suffered a concussion during a collision with another outfielder while playing for Class AA New Britain in August.\n\nBuxton, rated the No. 1 prospect in baseball by Baseball America before the season, also suffered a sore shoulder, bruised toe and bruised right wrist during the season, limiting him to just 31 games.","239":"Buy Your Favorite Restaurant's Merch A new site is a one-stop shop for T-shirts, books and other items from more than a dozen New York restaurants.\n\nTo gin up much-needed income restaurants are offering souvenir merchandise in addition to food to go.

Now, it's a shopping strategy that can literally help save lives. Since customer and employee safety are top priority, buybuy BABY curbside pickup has been added to the store's list of services. Whether you need diapers and wipes or some soap for the tub, now you can stock up without risking your health.\n\nUnlike a lot of other retail stores, buybuy BABY won't make you download a special app to utilize the curbside pickup. All you need to do is go online and find out if the product you're looking for is in stock or not. Once you've found what you need, you can add it to your cart to reserve for curbside pickup (or in-store pickup depending on the item). \"Customers can pick up much needed essentials like diapers, wipes and formula without ever leaving their car,\" Laine Shear, a representative for buybuy BABY, tells Romper.\n\nRight now, a lot of retailers are struggling to keep in-demand items like diapers, wipes, formula, and Tylenol on the shelves, which is frustrating for parents who need those items so badly that they are willing to go out in public during a pandemic to get them. Additionally, many stores aren't able to keep up with the number of pickup requests they're getting, so customers have to schedule a pickup days in advance, which isn't exactly easy to do with a baby who suddenly decides to go through a growth spurt and drink all the formula in the house. You don't need to worry about that with buybuy BABY's curbside pickup, though, because Shear says after reserving an in-stock item, \"shoppers will then receive a 'ready to pickup' email within just two business hours.\" And as for buybuy BABY's product availability, Shear says that the \"company is hard at work to keep the products your family needs available.\"\n\nSo, before you try to brave the grocery store in person, check out buybuy BABY first, because you may be able to get everything you need for your little one without even having to leave your car.","241":"CCAP regulates feeding behavior via the NPF pathway in Drosophila adults The ability of an animal to sense what to eat, such as carbohydrate-rich food, as well as to reject food that may be disadvantageous or even deadly is essential for survival and adaptation to metabolic demands compounded by continuous changes in the environment. Here we investigate evolutionarily conserved pathways central for either choosing or rejecting nutrients based on neuronal system interactions between internal signals and the external milieu. These pathways are likely to be necessary for the ability to perform quick adaptation to the immediate conditions and in general provide clues to the structure of the fly's internal network governing nutrient sensing.\n\nThe intake of macronutrients is crucial for the fitness of any animal and is mainly regulated by peripheral signals to the brain. How the brain receives and translates these peripheral signals or how these interactions lead to changes in feeding behavior is not well-understood. We discovered that 2 crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP)-expressing neurons in Drosophila adults regulate feeding behavior and metabolism. Notably, loss of CCAP, or knocking down the CCAP receptor (CCAP-R) in 2 dorsal median neurons, inhibits the release of neuropeptide F (NPF), which regulates feeding behavior. Furthermore, under starvation conditions, flies normally have an increased sensitivity to sugar; however, loss of CCAP, or CCAP-R in 2 dorsal median NPF neurons, inhibited sugar sensitivity in satiated and starved flies. Separate from its regulation of NPF signaling, the CCAP peptide also regulates triglyceride levels. Additionally, genetic and optogenetic studies demonstrate that CCAP signaling is necessary and sufficient to stimulate a reflexive feeding behavior, the proboscis extension reflex (PER), elicited when external food cues are interpreted as palatable. Dopaminergic signaling was also sufficient to induce a PER. On the other hand, although necessary, NPF neurons were not able to induce a PER. These data illustrate that the CCAP peptide is a central regulator of feeding behavior and metabolism in adult flies, and that NPF neurons have an important regulatory role within this system.","242":"CJ McCollum suggests 150 NBA players are living paycheck to paycheck The COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly taken its toll on Americans and people all over the world.\n\nIt's certainly a scary time right now as we continue to navigate through these unchartered waters, while also continuing our efforts to flatten the curve.\n\nWith so much uncertainty out there, so many are already hurting financially around the country.\n\nBut, could this really be affecting some NBA players' finances?\n\nWith the NBA remaining in suspension to help limit the spread of COVID-19, tough decisions about the rest of the season are being discussed, which includes a significant reduction in pay for NBA players.\n\nTrail Blazers shooting guard CJ McCollum joined former NBA player Jay Williams on the digital show The Boardroom, which is aimed at what's really changing the game.\n\nMcCollum shared his opinions on how he believes 150 NBA players of the 450 are currently living paycheck to paycheck.\n\n\"I would say there are some guys in the league that are hurting right now because obviously a work stoppage is in place, there could be a pay stoppage.

Autophagy is known to be critical for plant responses to multiple stresses, including drought, but a direct link between drought tolerance and autophagy is still lacking. We report here the identification of a plant-specific protein, COST1 (constitutively stressed 1), which attenuates autophagy under optimal growth conditions, thus controlling the trade-off between plant growth and stress tolerance. In addition to expanding our understanding of the regulation of autophagy in plants, the enhanced drought tolerance of a cost1 mutant and the high conservation of COST proteins throughout the plant kingdom also indicates a potential for engineering COST1 to enhance stress tolerance in crops.\n\nPlants balance their competing requirements for growth and stress tolerance via a sophisticated regulatory circuitry that controls responses to the external environments. We have identified a plant-specific gene, COST1 (constitutively stressed 1), that is required for normal plant growth but negatively regulates drought resistance by influencing the autophagy pathway. An Arabidopsis thaliana cost1 mutant has decreased growth and increased drought tolerance, together with constitutive autophagy and increased expression of drought-response genes, while overexpression of COST1 confers drought hypersensitivity and reduced autophagy. The COST1 protein is degraded upon plant dehydration, and this degradation is reduced upon treatment with inhibitors of the 26S proteasome or autophagy pathways. The drought resistance of a cost1 mutant is dependent on an active autophagy pathway, but independent of other known drought signaling pathways, indicating that COST1 acts through regulation of autophagy. In addition, COST1 colocalizes to autophagosomes with the autophagosome marker ATG8e and the autophagy adaptor NBR1, and affects the level of ATG8e protein through physical interaction with ATG8e, indicating a pivotal role in direct regulation of autophagy. We propose a model in which COST1 represses autophagy under optimal conditions, thus allowing plant growth. Under drought, COST1 is degraded, enabling activation of autophagy and suppression of growth to enhance drought tolerance. Our research places COST1 as an important regulator controlling the balance between growth and stress responses via the direct regulation of autophagy.","245":"COVID-19 tests sick time laws in Minneapolis and St. Paul Paid sick time laws in Minneapolis and St. Paul are facing a major test amid the spread of COVID-19, as workers cash out their hours to avoid going into workplaces that remain open, or as a stopgap before their first unemployment check arrives.\n\nThe cities, which both implemented earned sick and safe time policies in recent years, are fielding questions from workers and employers and updating online information about how the ordinances apply during a pandemic.\n\n\"I really believe we fought hard for a policy like this so that it would be preventative against the situation we now find ourselves in,\" said St. Paul City Council Member Mitra Jalali. \"If everywhere had [earned sick and safe time] and it was fully being followed, there's a strong argument that more people could have stayed home and not gotten other people sick.\"\n\nIn a statement late Wednesday, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey urged employers in the city \"to retain their employees and pay retained employees who have accrued earned sick and safe time if the business is financially capable of doing so.\"\n\nWorkers who are laid off and return to work within 90 days are entitled to accrued sick time they previously earned, he said.\n\nBrian Walsh, director of labor standards enforcement in the Minneapolis Department of Civil Rights, said the city has been hearing from workers wondering what to do when their accrued sick time runs out. That's where unemployment insurance comes in, he said.\n\nTens of thousands of Minnesotans applied for unemployment insurance after Gov. Tim Walz issued an emergency order Monday closing bars, restaurants and other public places. Walz also issued an executive order eliminating the requirement that workers wait a week before applying.\n\nIn addition to covering workers who are sick or caring for a sick family member, the sick time ordinances in both Minneapolis and St. Paul cover workers whose employers have been ordered to shut down.\n\n\"In the industries where the mayor or governor has ordered closure, the idea is that sick and safe time would help bridge those workers, or help keep them afloat, until they actually start receiving their unemployment insurance benefits checks,\" Walsh said.\n\nKevin Osborn, who is on furlough from his job as a line cook at Alma, said he's expecting his last check on Friday to include his paid-time-off balance. After that, he said, he's praying for unemployment to come through.\n\nOsborn and other members of the Restaurant Opportunities Center (ROC), a group that advocates for restaurant workers, are considering creating an emergency fund for those who need it, he said.\n\n\"If this goes on for a couple months, so many of our restaurants just won't be there to come back to,\" he said. \"Or if they are, they're not going to hire us all back.\"\n\nFor those whose workplaces remain open, the situation is even more dire. Alyssa Rodewald, a supervisor at a Caribou Coffee shop in Minneapolis, said she and several co-workers have decided to stay home to avoid getting sick, even though they won't get paid once their paid time off is exhausted. Because the coffee shop remains open, they can't file for unemployment.\n\nAccording to the Caribou website, select locations are closed and those still open no longer offer in-store seating. A request for comment was not immediately returned.\n\nRodewald started an online petition, which had more than 1,000 signatures Thursday, calling for Caribou to close temporarily and provide emergency paid leave \"until the threat of this virus is contained.\"\n\n\"We want to get paid,\" she said. \"We don't want to have to risk our lives.\"","246":"CRISPR recognizes as many phage types as possible without overwhelming the Cas machinery This article requires a subscription to view the full text.

Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nIn 2007, researchers at Danisco interested in fortifying the lactic acid bacteria used to produce dairy products such as milk and cheese against attack by phage showed that CRISPR provided resistance (1). These phage infections were common in industrial dairy fermentation, and it was hugely significant that insertion of multiple spacers in the bacterial CRISPR system was shown to protect against them. Intriguingly, rare mutations in the phage regions from which these spacers were derived were also shown to give rise to lineages that could again reinfect the bacteria. Thus was born the study of the phage-bacteria immune system arms race. In PNAS, Bradde et al. (2) present a theory of the tradeoff between broad coverage of phage types and efficient use of a limited number of enzymes in each bacterium that leads to an optimal size of the CRISPR immune system.\n\nEarlier bioinformatics studies had shown that the majority of spacers in bacterial CRISPR arrays matched phage or conjugative plasmids that naturally infect the bacteria containing the CRISPR array (3). These CRISPR spacers were found to be the most polymorphic sites in plague Yersinia pestis strains, and thus potentially useful for forensically tracing the origins of prokaryotic pathogens (4). In the same year, bioinformatic analysis showed that spacers from multiple strains and species of Streptococcus were homologous to phage and plasmid sequences (5). The sensitivity of Streptococcus thermophilus to phage was shown to correlate with the number of spacers in the CRISPR locus. A significant number of studies followed up on these observations that bacterial resistance to phage correlated with spacer diversity in the CRISPR array (6\u21d3-8).\n\nLater studies confirmed the ability of S. thermophilus to insert phage sequences into its CRISPR array and analyzed thousands of spacers from over a hundred strains (9).

Kirk Cousins' numbers rank with the NFL's best. He has one year left with the Vikings but it's a deal that has a salary cap hit that leaves little room for other players.\n\nNFL free agency kicks off March 18, but you have to wonder why we aren't hearing anything about the future of Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins even though we are now more than a month past the Super Bowl.\n\nCousins has a year left on his deal, but there is no question that the club has to be considering all options when it comes to their signal caller.\n\nThis might seem crazy, but would the Vikings drop Cousins when his contract expires and go with former Vikings quarterback Teddy Bridgewater from New Orleans, who would have a much smaller price tag?\n\nWith the news that Drew Brees is going to return to the Saints, the fact is that Bridgewater, who is an unrestricted free agent, could be available.\n\nStill the stats seem to indicate that there's no way the Vikings will let Cousins go, even after his gigantic three-year, $84 million deal is up.\n\nIn the two seasons that Cousins has been in Minnesota, he ranks sixth in the NFL in passer rating at 103.0 -- trailing only Brees, Patrick Mahomes, Russell Wilson, Ryan Tannehill and Lamar Jackson.\n\nHis completion percentage of 69.71 is second in the league over the past two seasons behind only Brees.\n\nAnd his 56 touchdown passes trail only Mahomes, Wilson, Matt Ryan and Brees.\n\nThe fact is that Cousins has earned the contract the Vikings gave him.\n\nBut can they afford to pay him that kind of money going forward?\n\nLooking to the 2021 season, as their salary cap currently stands, the Vikings have no way to afford Cousins if he's going to earn $31 million like he will this season.\n\nVikings' 2020 salary cap table\n\nThey already owe $161 million to just 31 players, and they need to fill out a 53 man roster.\n\nIf they were to pay Cousins $31 million in 2021, their salary cap would be at $192 million with 21 players left to sign.\n\nBridgewater can play\n\nBridgewater, of course, has never really gotten a shot as a starter since he suffered that devastating knee injury with the Vikings right before the 2016 season.\n\nIn two seasons in New Orleans he has played in 14 games and started six.\n\nLast year in five starts, Bridgewater threw for 1,205 yards with nine touchdowns and two interceptions while completing 69.7% of his passes for a 103.7 passer rating. The Saints went 5-0 in those games -- including wins over Dallas and Seattle.\n\nA big reason why many believe Cousins will get a contract extension from the Vikings is that the 2021 free agent quarterback class -- which Cousins would be a part of -- is so thin. The biggest names on the list are Cousins, Cam Newton and Andy Dalton.\n\nSo there's a good chance Cousins would get a big offer from elsewhere.\n\nThe only question is, how can the Vikings afford to keep paying him this kind of money?\n\nThielen and Johnson\n\nOne of the great stories out of the NFL scouting combine is the fact that former Gophers star receiver Tyler Johnson has been receiving a lot of help and advice from Vikings star Adam Thielen. Johnson has been training at Thielen's ETS Performance Gym in Lakeville.\n\nJohnson, who didn't do testing at the combine but will instead do that at his Gophers Pro Day on March 25, said at his media sessions in Indianapolis that he has received some great advice from Thielen.\n\n\"I was able to work out with him when I got back to Minnesota for the past few days. He just told me to be me,\" Johnson said. \"That was important to me, important to him and he felt it was best for me.\"\n\nWhen it came to Johnson's decision to not work out at the combine, he said it was about putting himself in the best position possible going into the draft.\n\n\"It was pretty difficult because it's a prime-time event, and I love to compete. To showcase my talent on prime-time television is something I'd love to do,\" Johnson said. \"But being able to make the best decision for me was most important, March 25 is when I'll be comfortable.\"\n\nYes, the fact is that Thielen never got to go to the NFL combine or have many scouts take a look at him, as he went undrafted out of MSU Mankato before signing with the Vikings on a rookie free agent deal.\n\nJohnson won't have that trouble.\n\nPro Football Focus has the Gophers standout rated as the 47th-best player in the draft and 11th-best prospect at wide receiver.\n\nDiggs vs. Diggs\n\nVikings wideout Stefon Diggs might get a chance to line up next season against his brother Trevon, who is ranked as the 27th-best prospect in the NFL draft as a cornerback out of Alabama, according to PFF.\n\nAn article in USA Today talked about the tremendous bond the two players have for each other as they helped each other after the death of their father, Aron Diggs, who died at age 39 from heart failure.\n\n\"That's like my dad, honestly,\" Trevon said of Stefon. \"He was there for me when my father passed, so, he's always taking care of me. I always ask him everything -- 2 o'clock in the morning, I'm asking him questions.\"\n\nWhile Stefon Diggs was a fourth-round draft pick out of Maryland, who had to prove himself throughout his playing career after dealing with injuries, his brother figures to be a first-round pick in the draft.\n\nDiggs posted 37 tackles, eight pass deflections and three interceptions last year for the Crimson Tide -- including an interception he returned 79 yards for a touchdown.\n\nHe said when he joined Alabama he knew he was going to have to earn every minute of playing time.\n\n\"I came in with a mind-set,\" Trevon said. \"My brother told me, 'You're going all the way to Alabama, so you're going to have to compete.' That's what I did. I was always looking for a way to get into the field whether it was offense, defense or special teams. Whatever I have to do, I'm going to learn, I'm going to do it.\"\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of one day facing Stefon in an NFL game, Trevon said, \"I feel like it'll be easier. The younger brother is always better than the big brother.\"\n\nIn an interesting note, ESPN draft expert Todd McShay ran a post-combine mock draft and had the Vikings taking Trevon at No. 25 overall.","250":"Cancer epithelia-derived mitochondrial DNA is a targetable initiator of a paracrine signaling loop that confers taxane resistance Edited by David A. Tuveson, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, and accepted by Editorial Board Member Rakesh K. Jain March 3, 2020 (received for review June 25, 2019)\n\nThe work provides a conceptual advance in functionally defining the cross talk of tumor epithelia with cancer-associated fibroblastic cells contributing to tumor progression and therapeutic resistance. Independent of protein-based signaling molecules, prostate cancer cells secreted mitochondrial DNA to induce associated fibroblasts to generate anaphylatoxin C3a to support tumor progression in a positive feedback loop. Interestingly, the standard of care chemotherapy, docetaxel, used to treat castrate-resistant prostate cancer was found to further potentiate this paracrine-signaling axis to mediate therapeutic resistance. Blocking anaphylatoxin C3a signaling cooperatively sensitized prostate cancer tumors to docetaxel. We reveal that docetaxel resistance is not a cancer cell-autonomous phenomena and that targeting an immune modulator derived from cancer-associated fibroblasts can limit the expansion of docetaxel-resistant tumors.","251":"Caneel Bay: Why a Caribbean Paradise Remains in Ruins Two years after back-to-back hurricanes struck St. John, the famed Caneel Bay Resort has not reopened. The storms' lingering aftermath laid bare the eco-resort's long-festering problems.\n\nBrowned palm leaves fan over the white-sand beaches of Caneel Bay Resort. Peeling paint buckles on the exterior walls of roofless cabins. Inside, white curtains, still knotted, drape like ripped cobwebs from windows, and mold-matted mattresses sag without their frames. A back door swings wide.\n\nLong considered the crown jewel of St. John, a small emerald island found among the U.S. Virgin Islands and cut with curved bays and set against the turquoise waters of the Caribbean, the 170 secluded acres of Caneel Bay once drew presidents, movie stars and literary icons -- from John Steinbeck and Lady Bird Johnson to Meryl Streep and Mitch McConnell.\n\nMore than 15,000 people annually visited the property nestled within the Virgin Islands National Park and home to a handful of endangered species. The four-star eco-resort, established by the Rockefeller family, was one of the first in the United States.\n\nLovango Cay\n\nSt. John\n\nHoneymoon beach\n\nCaneel Bay Resort\n\nVIRGIN ISLANDS\n\nNATIONAL Park\n\nCruz Bay\n\nThe Westin\n\nSt. John Resort Villas\n\nCaribbean Sea\n\n2 mileS\n\nAtlantic Ocean\n\n15 mileS\n\nU.S. VIRGIN\n\nISLANDS\n\nBritish\n\nVirgin\n\nIslands\n\nCULEBRA\n\nST.

Hurricanes Irma and Maria -- both Category Five storms -- flogged St. John, ripping apart structures and flooding what remained.\n\nEven as other accommodations in the region have reopened, Caneel Bay remains in tatters. Those who have ventured inside recall a newspaper on the front desk dated September 2017 -- just before the first storm. Scheduled weddings marked the chalkboard, they say, and rats could be seen scurrying across the wine cellar floor.\n\nWhile the hurricanes ripped apart the resort's infrastructure in a matter of hours, the storms' lingering aftermath laid bare its long-festering problems, which include an unorthodox land-use agreement with the federal government, possible environmental contamination that predated the storms and contentious relationships between the staff and management. Together, they have stalled the resort's reconstruction and hurt the island's economy.\n\nCaneel Bay's future is tied up in a dispute between its owner, CBI Acquisitions, which took over the resort in 2004, and the National Park Service, which owns the land where Caneel Bay sits. CBI Acquisitions says they cannot afford to rebuild unless they get an extension of their right to control and use the resort property from the Park Service.\n\nIn turn, the Park Service says that the agreement needs to be renegotiated and that it needs to complete environmental testing -- on hold since 2014 -- to determine the extent of mercury, arsenic and other hazardous chemicals previously found on the property, as well as the cost of the cleanup.\n\n'The first ferry over'\n\nBob Natt and his wife, Helen, honeymooned at Caneel Bay in 1971. As their family grew, they spread to several cabins, staying some 30 to 35 times over 46 years.\n\n\"Getting a Christmas cottage on Caneel Bay was like something you put in your will -- it was that hard to get,\" said Mr. Natt, who lives in Easton, Conn.\n\nTo stay in its 166 simply furnished cabins, guests spent an average of $727 a night -- and up to almost $2,000 during the period around Christmas.\n\nMr. Natt, 71, has maintained contact with management. \"I said 'the day you open, I want to be on the first ferry over'.\"\n\nIn 2017, less than two weeks after employees waved the last boatload of guests from the dock, ahead of an annual eight-week hurricane season closure, Hurricane Irma hammered St. John and neighboring St. Thomas, splintering trees, ripping off roofs, twisting metal frames and collapsing walls.\n\nTwelve days later, Hurricane Maria swallowed what little remained -- including the initial repair efforts -- dumping up to three feet of rain atop the devastation.\n\nAt other hotels, the push to rebuild was almost immediate. The Westin St. John Resort Villas, one of the few other resorts on St. John, employed staff to help with the cleanup, which took 16 months. The resort fully reopened to guests last February.\n\nAt first, Caneel employees -- who made up seven percent of the U.S. Virgin Islands' total employment in the hotel and restaurant sector, \"putting Caneel on par with Walmart in terms of the number of jobs created in a state by a single employer,\" according to a Congressional white paper -- expected they would be similarly involved in their resort's clean up, as they had with previous storms.\n\nBut this time, hundreds of workers found themselves unemployed. Unionized employees, some who had worked on the resort for decades, received termination letters by mail.\n\n\"The whole community is hurting,\" said Theresa Germain, a housekeeper who retired months before the storms and worked on the resort about 35 years.\n\nBut no rebuilding began.\n\nCBI Acquisitions, a limited liability company based in Connecticut and created to purchase the resort, has the rights for land use and occupancy until 2023. Gary Engle, the resort's principal owner, has refused to rebuild without an extension of those rights, saying it is not worth the investment of about $100 million to rebuild most units and install new electrical wiring and plumbing, among other tasks.\n\n\"Lack of clarity is the major problem with the resort right now,\" Mr. Engle said in an interview. \"Because without fixing the uncertainty, there's no money that's going to be invested in this property.\"\n\nThe destroyed resort is an inescapable sight on such a small island. Only the main entrance has been repaired. For $10, visitors can take a golf cart ride from there to Honeymoon Beach, the only beach out of seven associated with the resort that has reopened.\n\nThe golf cart trundles over a potholed path, jagged with bare pipes and winds past an eerie landscape of deserted cabins, overgrown brush and felled trees.\n\nThe Rockefellers arrive\n\nIn 1952, while cruising along the Caribbean, Laurance Spelman Rockefeller, the grandson of the oil tycoon and a successful venture capitalist and conservationist, docked at Caneel Bay, where he bought the stock of an existing resort.\n\nMr. Rockefeller and another developer soon began buying real estate around the resort. Despite reservations from some residents, they planned to create a national park.\n\nEventually, Mr. Rockefeller turned over more than 5,000 acres to the National Park Service, which today owns almost two-thirds of the island.\n\nIn 1956, Mr. Rockefeller opened an environmentally focused resort in the heart of the newly created Virgin Islands National Park -- on land he kept for himself.\n\nTheovald E. Moorehead, a native of St. John and local lawmaker who successfully petitioned Congress to prevent islanders' land from being condemned for the park, grew concerned over changes he witnessed on the island.\n\n\"We like tourists but we will not sacrifice ourselves to make this a happy place for tourists,\" he wrote in 1958. \"What we want is a happy island -- happy for everyone -- including ourselves.\"\n\nAs the years passed, the Caribbean, a popular destination for American travelers accustomed to luxury hotels, saw an influx of big-brand hoteliers and cruise lines; Many benefited from offshore tax incentives from the U.S. Virgin Islands Economic Development Commission, an organization geared toward aiding companies establishing themselves in the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nCaneel Bay Plantation, as it was then called, offered an alternative experience beyond chain brand amenities -- with cabins just footsteps from the water, and an informal communal teatime where guests mingled each day on the veranda.\n\nThe Rockefeller family donated the property to the Park Service in 1983, but based on a vaguely written legal condition, they continued operating the resort through one of their nonprofits, untethered by typical National Park standards.\n\nThe \"retained use estate\" contract -- now the only such commercial agreement across the Parks Systems -- was 13 pages long, bare bones compared to current park leases, and immediately caused confusion. Within a year, the Interior Department, which oversees the Park Service, explained the parks had \"very little authority\" on the property, based on \"the expansive nature\" of the Rockefellers' reserved rights.\n\nThe resort changed hands several times, eventually causing even Mr. Rockefeller concerns. He wrote to the Park Service director in 1988: \"It is my sincere hope that you would not consider granting any request to extend the Retained Use Estate at Caneel Bay.\" He added that his \"intention and expectation\" was for the R.U.E. to expire by 2023.\n\nAn asbestos pipe, stalled testing and no answers\n\nCaneel Bay Resort was one of the region's few eco-lodge resorts, featuring a reverse osmosis water plant and environmentally friendly upgrades. And the land agreement with the Park Service -- which receives no payment for use of the federal property -- along with long-extended benefits from the Economic Development Commission, made the resort's business position enviable.\n\nShortly after CBI Acquisitions took over the land agreement in 2004, Mr. Engle, started looking for ways to extend the R.U.E.\n\n\"That was an essential part of the transaction,\" Mr. Engle said of the initial purchase. But despite the benefits, he said it wasn't all positive, particularly the lack of clarity around what would happen after the agreement expired in 2023.\n\nA bill passed by Congress in 2010 would enable a 40-year extension, following routine environmental testing, and contingent on the company relinquishing the mandates of the R.U.E.\n\nInitial environmental tests were conducted in 2012 and 2014; but while some results were made public, those referring to potential environmental problems were not.\n\nThose unpublished assessments, reviewed by The Times and National Parks Traveler, a news website covering the parks and other protected areas that provided The Times with some documents, noted, among other concerns \"a release of hazardous substances or petroleum products\" throughout the property, including excessive amounts of mercury and arsenic.\n\nA pipe with \"approximately 30 percent asbestos,\" considered a high amount, was also found, and an employee told the assessors that more pipes existed.\n\nNo health problems have been documented, but the Park Service, which requested the tests as part of departmental policy, noted that more tests were needed. The public was never alerted, and the follow-up tests never happened.\n\nCaitlin Klevorick, a CBI Acquisitions spokeswoman, said by email that the company believed that if any potential environmental problems exist, they resulted before CBI Acquisitions became landholders.\n\n\"Caneel Bay was fully committed to and did operate the resort to ensure guests' safety,\" she said.\n\nMichael Litterst, acting chief of public affairs for the Park Service, declined to be interviewed, noting \"both pending legislation and potential litigation.\"\n\nBut Stephanie Roulett, a Park Service spokeswoman, said by email that the agency had tried to get on the property multiple times and had not been granted access. She said that while they could implement a \"legal procedure,\" they had \"thus-far not significantly pushed back.\"\n\nA series of letters between Mr. Engle and the Park Service, obtained by The Times, illustrates negotiations at loggerheads.\n\nIn April 2019, Mr. Engle sent the Interior department a letter claiming the right to \"immediately and automatically\" take over the property unless the government paid $70 million and assured indemnification \"from all environmental liabilities.\"\n\nThe agency rejected Mr. Engle's ultimatum, repeating a request for additional environmental testing.\n\nMs. Klevorick, the resort spokeswoman, said the company is \"committed to further cooperation with the NPS in the next phase of an environmental site investigation.\"\n\nThe storm before the storms\n\nEven before the hurricanes forced the resort to shut down, some longtime employees had become increasingly frustrated.\n\nMs. Germain, the housekeeper and local union representative, said when she started working at the resort in the 1980s, staffers had a sense of pride but that diminished under new management.\n\n\"As time passed it got a dose of bad management,\" she said. \"They treated us really poorly -- really bad down to the last.\"\n\nEmployees who had been full-time said that their hours declined in favor of seasonal workers. (Ms. Klevorick said that CBI Acquisitions \"always prioritized\" full-time employees over seasonal workers.) Management also instituted a security policy in which it checked employees' bags before they left the resort each day.\n\nSheryl Parris, who has been president of the local union representing Caneel Bay since 2012, said that the \"very insensitive\" practices evoked hard feelings.\n\nCaneel also attempted to reduce its full-time staff, successfully negotiating in April 2017 with the Economic Development Commission to decrease the minimum number of employees with full-time status to 230, a reduction of almost 100 people.\n\nAdditionally, despite continuing to collect local tax breaks -- including a 90 percent income tax exemption and full exemptions from other taxes -- the resort did not actually employ most of their workers year-round. All but a few dozen were let go each year for a six-to-eight week hurricane season closure, beginning in 2009.\n\nOther resorts on nearby islands have also implemented such closures, but previous owners of Caneel Bay had never done seasonal layoffs. At a public hearing the day the work force agreement was announced, one commission member expressed reservations about the habitual layoffs but the resort continued the practice.\n\n'I want to do the right thing'\n\nMonths after the storms, and with the resort moldering on site, Stacey E. Plaskett, the U.S.V.I. delegate in Congress, introduced a new bill allowing a 60-year extension on the R.U.E. to coax the owners to rebuild. Missing from the bill's text: any mention of required environmental testing.\n\nSome resort staff and the greater St. John community felt excluded from the process and the bill was not well-received, particularly by some former employees who say they still never received paychecks for their last two weeks of work. Ms. Klevorick said the company was unaware of any employees who had not received payment \"but recognizes that immediately following the storms it was very chaotic.\"\n\nAs Ms. Plaskett's approval rating plummeted on St. John, her working relationship with Mr. Engle also deteriorated; he appeared uninterested in working with the community, she said.\n\nMr. Engle acknowledged community frustration.\n\n\"Maybe when I was down there I didn't handle it as well as I could have,\" he said. \"I want to do the right thing for the employees, I want to do the right thing for the community and the Virgin Islands.\"\n\nThen, about a year after the storms, Mr. Engle invited former employees and others onto the resort property for a meeting. Several people there recalled him framing the rebuild as contingent on the bill's passage. Ms. Parris recalled employees offering to return and clean up, but instead, she said of the company: \"They were waiting for that bill and so they kept all the employees waiting.\"\n\nThe bill died. Ms. Plaskett said she has no plans to introduce new legislation.\n\nNegotiations between CBI Acquisitions and the Park Service are ongoing. Last month, the company submitted a proposal to the service, and Ms. Roulett said earlier this month that the agency was currently drafting its own.\n\n52 Places to Go in 2020\n\nWe picked destinations to inspire you, delight you and motivate you to explore the world.\n\n'$60 and you're doing good'\n\nThe loss of tourism has had lasting effects on bars and restaurants, as well as cabdrivers, who made the bulk of their money taking guests to and from dinner to places like ZoZo's at The Sugar Mill, an Italian restaurant once located at Caneel.\n\n\"Before, everybody was making something,\" recalled Everett Wilkinson, one cabdriver. \"Now everyone is hustling for whatever they can make.

In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, we examined the acute and delayed effects of \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) intoxication on susceptibility to false memory in 64 healthy volunteers. Memory was tested immediately (encoding and retrieval under drug influence) and 1 wk later (retrieval sober). We used three different methods (associative word lists and two misinformation tasks using virtual reality). Across all methods, we found evidence for enhanced false-memory effects in intoxicated participants. Specifically, intoxicated participants showed higher false recognition in the associative word-list task both at immediate and delayed test than controls. This yes bias became increasingly strong with decreasing levels of association between studied and test items. In a misinformation task, intoxicated participants were more susceptible to false-memory creation using a virtual-reality eyewitness scenario and virtual-reality perpetrator scenario. False-memory effects were mostly restricted to the acute-intoxication phase. Cannabis seems to increase false-memory proneness, with decreasing strength of association between an event and a test item, as assessed by different false-memory paradigms. Our findings have implications for how and when the police should interview suspects and eyewitnesses.\n\nCannabis is the most widely used illicit substance across the world, and its main psychoactive ingredient, \u03949-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), has been associated with memory impairments (e.g., ref. 1). As a potential factor impacting memory, cannabis intoxication is an issue of particular interest from a legal perspective. That is, testimonies by eyewitnesses or suspects are oftentimes the only piece of evidence that triers of fact can use for legal decision making, and, thus, gathering reliable testimony is crucial. However, memory performance is imperfect, resulting sometimes in false memories (i.e., memories of nonexperienced events\/details; refs. 2 and 3), and such false memories can have disastrous consequences in legal cases (e.g., wrongful convictions or false accusations). This phenomenon of false memory, combined with the fact that cannabis-intoxicated eyewitnesses and suspects are common (4), stresses the need to examine whether cannabis might facilitate false-memory production. Empirical work in this area is rather limited (see ref. 5 for a recent review). In the current experiment, we conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled study to test the impact of cannabis on false-memory formation using three prominent false-memory paradigms.\n\nCore to many false-memory paradigms is the presentation of words or events to which one has been exposed before (\"old\") or not (\"new\"). Old-new recognition decisions can be affected by response bias, a general tendency to respond to items in a systematic but potentially false direction (e.g., yes bias). Some people adopt a stricter decision criterion, requiring a higher level of memory strength to call an item old, while others may respond more liberally (6). We investigated whether individuals who are under the influence of cannabis express a different bias, and, if so, if it would be influenced by levels of association between old and new events. Single doses of cannabis have been found to cause deficits in decision making and working memory (7\u21d3-9) that have been associated to increased cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1 receptor) activation in the hippocampus (10, 11). It is not clear, however, whether cannabis also affects the tendency of how individuals respond to events that may or may not have happened. It has been suggested that hippocampal CB1 receptor activation might underlie the formation of incidental associations (12), which would predict an increase in false memories.\n\nThe false-memory literature broadly distinguishes between two types: \"Spontaneous\" false memories arise due to internal cognitive processes, whereas \"suggestion-based\" false memories occur because of external suggestion (13, 14). A highly reliable and common method to evoke spontaneous false memories is the Deese\/Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm (15\u21d3-17), in which people falsely remember words not actually presented in an associatively related list of words. Research on cannabis and DRM false-memory formation is sparse, but in a recent field study, we compared intoxicated vs. nonintoxicated cannabis users vs. a nonusing control group (18). No statistical difference between groups was found for the acceptance of \"critical lures\" (associated but nonpresented theme words). However, false alarms to nonpresented irrelevant stimuli (unrelated to theme) were increased in both sober and intoxicated cannabis users. These findings might be interpreted as reminiscent of a cannabis-induced response bias (\"yes-saying\" bias) that might vary depending on the strength of association between studied and test items (see also refs. 19 and 20 for related findings).\n\nSuggestion-based false memories are frequently studied by using the misinformation paradigm. Here, participants first view or are involved in an event (e.g., mock crime), then are exposed to misinformation (e.g., suggestive questions or misleading narrative containing false details), and, finally, receive a memory test. Exposure to postevent misinformation often results in people incorporating the suggested details into their memory reports, a phenomenon that is also known as the \"misinformation effect\" (for a review, see ref. 21). To our knowledge, no study thus far has implemented this method to study the effects of cannabis on suggestion-based false memory.\n\nThe current experiment aimed to assess the impact of cannabis intoxication on both spontaneous (DRM) and suggestion-based (misinformation) false-memory production in healthy, occasional cannabis users. The DRM method allowed us to specifically test recognition rates at different levels of association between old and new items. Thus, the level of association is highest for old (i.e., studied) words. Compared to this, the association for new words is lower, but highest for critical lures, less for related lures, and lowest for unrelated words. In general, the misinformation method is not constructed by using similar associative mechanisms as in the DRM method, but does contain questions about presented or nonpresented details that also differ in their level of association. That is, truly presented details were present at encoding and, thus, were highly linked with the experience, while suggested details were linked through the suggestion of being present in the scenario. Nonsuggested, nonpresented details were weakly linked to the experience. Since CB1 activation facilitates formation of incidental associations (12), we tested how cannabis affected the response bias for items with different associative strengths.\n\nAnother element of the current experiment was that we used virtual reality (VR) as a way to test the misinformation effect in subjects acting as eyewitnesses and perpetrators. Studies have traditionally employed methods such as case vignettes or videos (22), but also staged events (23), to expose participants to a mock crime event, presenting a trade-off of either maximizing internal or external validity. The scenarios in this study were administered in VR, a fully immersive technology that can overcome this trade-off by combining high experimental control and reusability with high degrees of realism, ecological validity, and feelings of presence (24). Misinformation was introduced through a combination of suggestive questions in a later interview and a virtual cowitness. The interview contained questions about truly presented details (\"presented\"), leading questions about nonpresented details (\"suggested\"), and neutral questions about nonpresented details (\"nonsuggested\").\n\nThe study was conducted according to a double-blind, mixed-model, placebo-controlled design. Suggestion-induced false memory in VR scenarios was tested in a between-subjects design, whereas spontaneous false memory using the DRM paradigm was tested in a within-subjects design. In order to differentiate between acute and long-term drug effects, spontaneous and suggestion-based false memory were assessed at two time points: shortly after encoding (\"immediate\") and 1 wk later (\"delayed\"). Both assessments are of practical relevance. Intoxication during encoding and retrieval phases often occurs in eyewitness situations, which may affect immediate memory of the witnessed event. However, people are not always interviewed immediately following a crime, so it is also imperative to include a retrieval condition in which participants are sober. Given the described findings of cannabis-induced memory impairment (1, 18, 20), cannabis intoxication was generally expected to result in higher false-memory rates, compared to a placebo condition.","253":"Canon Just Filed a Patent for a Brand New Cripple Hammer | Fstoppers Details are emerging of a new patent just filed by Canon that could revolutionize one of its most exciting products: the Cripple Hammer. Brace yourselves, because the plans for this updated version look crazy.\n\nStepping away from its traditional mallet-like construction, it appears that Canon is planning to completely redesign the Hammer from the ground up, choosing to implement a double-ended claw hammer design that could make it trickier to use but will no doubt render the results more effective.\n\nWhile the traditional head will be useful for continuing to hamstring well-established features, the claw will give users the option to pry them off completely as if they never existed. The double-ended design will build redundancy into the system in the event that one end fails -- a useful feature given the need to simultaneously hamper and promote such a broad range of products.\n\nWith the possible double-ended design of new Cripple Hammer, you may end up inadvertently disabling features you never realized could be disabled.\n\nGiven that Canon's recent announcements promise the launch of some groundbreaking technology, a new hammer is probably inevitable. The R5 has taken the industry somewhat by surprise, offering stills at 20 frames per second with its electronic shutter and insane 8K video that uses the full width of the sensor. With such incredible features, an updated hammer makes complete sense, with rumors suggesting that Canon will now be able to implement major new handicaps such as a 2.6x crop on 4K, 1080p video where the zebras are hardcoded into the footage, and with C-Log only available if you don't remove the lens cap.\n\nSpeculation has been circulating that Canon has a high-resolution beast in the pipeline, with rumors varying between 90 and 150 megapixels for what could end up being an R5S or an R3. It's thought that thanks to this new Cripple Hammer, the camera can offer such a high resolution because it is shooting solely in bitmap.\n\nFor the first time, Canon will be bringing animal eye autofocus to its cameras, though the new Cripple Hammer means that it will only work when shooting the pig-footed bandicoot, the Madagascan pygmy hippopotamus, and the Wondiwoi tree-kangaroo. Canon fans will hope that dogs and cats may become possible following firmware updates.\n\nA stuffed pig-footed bandicoot.

In the years since people figured out that coffee could affect us in similar ways, the plant has done a great deal for our species, and our species in turn has done a great deal for the plant. We have given it more than 27 million acres of new habitat all around the world, assigned 25 million farming families to its care and feeding, and bid up its price until it became one of the most valuable globally traded crops. Not bad for a shrub that is neither edible nor particularly beautiful or easy to grow.\n\nCoffee owes its global ascendancy to a fortuitous evolutionary accident: The chemical compound that the plant makes to defend itself against insects happens to alter human consciousness in ways we find desirable, making us more energetic and industrious -- and notably better workers. That chemical of course is caffeine, which is now the world's most popular psychoactive drug, used daily by 80 percent of humanity. (It is the only such drug we routinely give to our children, in the form of soda.) Along with the tea plant, which produces the same compound in its leaves, coffee has helped create exactly the kind of world that coffee needs to thrive: a world driven by consumer capitalism, ringed by global trade, and dominated by a species that can now barely get out of bed without its help.\n\nThe effects of caffeine mesh with the needs of capitalism in myriad ways. Before the arrival of coffee and tea in the West in the 1600s, alcohol -- which was more sanitary than water -- was the drug that dominated, and fogged, human minds. This might have been acceptable, even welcome, when work meant physical labor performed out of doors (beer breaks were common), but alcohol's effects became a problem when work involved machines or numbers, as more and more of it did.\n\nFrom April 2020: Maya MacGuineas on capitalism's addiction problem\n\nEnter coffee, a drink that not only was safer than beer and wine (among other things, the water it was made with had to be boiled) but turned out to improve performance and stamina. In 1660, only a few years after coffee became available in England, one observer noted:\n\n'Tis found already, that this coffee drink hath caused a greater sobriety among the Nations. Whereas formerly Apprentices and clerks with others used to take their morning's draught of Ale, Beer, or Wine, which, by the dizziness they Cause in the Brain, made many unfit for business, they use now to play the Good-fellows in this wakeful and civil drink.\n\n\"This wakeful and civil drink\" also freed us from the circadian rhythms of our body, helping to stem the natural tides of exhaustion so that we might work longer and later hours; along with the advent of artificial light, caffeine abetted capitalism's conquest of night. It's probably no coincidence that the minute hand on clocks arrived at roughly the same historical moment as coffee and tea did, when work was moving indoors and being reorganized on the principle of the clock.\n\nThe intricate synergies of coffee and capitalism form the subtext of the historian Augustine Sedgewick's thoroughly engrossing first book, Coffeeland: One Man's Dark Empire and the Making of Our Favorite Drug. At the center of Sedgewick's narrative is James Hill, an Englishman born in the slums of industrial Manchester in 1871 who, at 18, sailed for Central America to make his fortune. There, he built a coffee dynasty by refashioning the Salvadoran countryside in the image of a Manchester factory. Hill became the head of one of the \"Fourteen Families\" who controlled the economy and politics of El Salvador for much of the 20th century; at the time of his death, in 1951, his 18 plantations employed some 5,000 people and produced more than 2,000 tons of export-ready coffee beans from more than 2,500 acres of rich soil on the slopes of the Santa Ana volcano. For many years, much of what Hill (or rather his workers) produced ended up in the familiar red tins of Hills Brothers coffee.\n\n\"What does it mean to be connected to faraway people and places through everyday things?\" Sedgewick asks in his early pages. Coffeeland offers a fascinating meditation on that question, by rendering once-obscure lines of connection starkly visible.\n\nFilling those cans of Hills Brothers coffee involved a few different forms of brutality. Because growing coffee requires a tremendous amount of labor -- for planting, pruning, picking, and processing -- a planter's success depends on finding enough people in the countryside willing to work. The essential question facing any would-be capitalist, as Sedgewick reminds us, has always and ever been \"What makes people work?\"\n\nChattel slavery had provided a good answer for Brazil's coffee farmers, but by the time Hill arrived in El Salvador, in 1889, slave labor was no longer an option. A smart and unsentimental businessman, Hill understood that he needed wage labor, lots of it, and as a son of the Manchester slums, he knew that the best answer to the question of what will make a person work was in fact simple: hunger.\n\nThere was only one problem. Rural Salvadorans, most of whom were Indians called \"mozos,\" weren't hungry. Many of them farmed small plots of communally owned land on the volcano, some of the most fertile in the country. This would have to change if El Salvador was to have an export crop. So at the behest of the coffee planters and in the name of \"development,\" the government launched a program of land privatization, forcing the Indians to either move to more marginal lands or find work on the new coffee plantations.\n\nRead: Caffeine, the world's most popular drug\n\nActually the choice wasn't initially quite so stark. Even the lands newly planted with coffee still offered plenty of free food for the picking. \"Veins of nourishment\" -- in the form of cashews, guavas, papayas, jocotes, figs, dragon fruits, avocados, mangoes, plantains, tomatoes, and beans -- \"ran through the coffee monoculture, and wherever there was food, however scant, there was freedom, however fleeting, from work,\" Sedgewick writes. The planters' solution to this \"problem\" -- the problem of nature's bounty -- was to eliminate from the landscape any plant that was not coffee, creating an ever more totalitarian monoculture in which nothing else was permitted to grow. When a chance avocado tree did manage to survive in some overlooked corner, the campesino caught tasting its fruit would be accused of theft and beaten if he was lucky, or shot if he was not. Thus was the concept of private property impressed upon the Indians.\n\nIn Sedgewick's words, \"What was needed to harness the will of the Salvadoran people to the production of coffee, beyond land privatization, was the plantation's production of hunger itself.\" James Hill did the math and found that workers showed up most promptly and worked most diligently if he paid them partly in cash -- 15 cents a day for women and double that for men -- and partly in food: breakfast and lunch, which consisted of two tortillas topped with as many beans as could be balanced on them. (The local diet became as monotonous as the landscape.) Hill thus transformed thousands of subsistence farmers and foragers into wage laborers, extracting quantities of surplus value that would be the envy of any Manchester factory owner.\n\nThe whole notion of surplus value of course is Karl Marx's and, as Sedgewick points out, emerged from Marx and Friedrich Engels's analysis of industrial capitalism in James Hill's birthplace. Communism was another Manchester export that found its way to Santa Ana, this one arriving during the Great Depression, when coffee prices collapsed and unemployed coffee workers could no longer eat from the land. It turns out that leftists were also able \"to transform hunger into power.\" The climax of Sedgewick's narrative comes in the early 1930s, when thousands of mozos, organized by homegrown Communists who had spent time abroad, rose up against the coffee barons, seizing plantations and occupying town halls.\n\nRevolution was afoot, at least until 1932, when the Salvadoran government, again at the behest of the coffee planters, launched a vicious counterinsurgency. Rounding up anyone who looked like an Indian, soldiers herded them into town squares and then opened fire with machine guns. The government's campaign against the coffee workers came to be known as La Matanza -- \"The Massacre\" -- and its memory burns bright in the Salvadoran countryside. When El Salvador erupted for a second time half a century later, the coffee barons were under siege again; James Hill's grandson, Jaime Hill, was kidnapped by rebels and held for a multimillion-dollar ransom, which the family had no trouble paying.\n\nI'm making Sedgewick's story sound more schematic than it really is. Though his analysis of coffee's political economy does owe a debt to Marx, his literary gifts and prodigious research make for a deeply satisfying reading experience studded with narrative surprise. Sedgewick has a knack for the sparkling digression and arresting jump cut, hopping back and forth between El Salvador and the wider world, where coffee was being consumed in ever-increasing quantities. He is especially good on the marketing of coffee to Americans, going back to independence, when the country broke from England's tea habit and drinking coffee became a patriotic act. He shows how coffee has long been promoted in America less as a tasty beverage or pleasurable experience than as a means to an end: \"a form of instant energy -- a work drug.\"\n\nAmerican scientists studied coffee intensively in the early years of the 20th century, seeking to understand how a beverage that contained virtually no calories could nevertheless supply energy to the human animal, seemingly in violation of the laws of thermodynamics. Coffee had the extraordinary ability to generate surplus value not only in its production but in its consumption as well, as an episode in the history of the coffee break makes clear.\n\nSedgewick tells the story of a small Denver necktie maker called Los Wigwam Weavers. When the company lost its best young male loom operators to the war effort in the early 1940s, the owner, Phil Greinetz, hired older men to replace them, but they lacked the dexterity needed to weave the intricate patterns in Wigwam's ties. Next he hired middle-aged women, and while they could produce ties to his standards, they lacked the stamina to work a full shift. When Greinetz called a company-wide meeting to discuss the problem, his employees had a suggestion: Give us a 15-minute break twice a day, with coffee.\n\nGreinetz instituted the coffee breaks and immediately noticed a change in his workers. The women began doing as much work in six and a half hours as the older men had done in eight. Greinetz made the coffee breaks compulsory, but he decided he didn't need to pay his workers for the half hour they were on break. This led to a suit from the Department of Labor and, eventually, to a 1956 decision by a federal appeals court that enshrined the coffee break in American life. The court ruled that because the coffee breaks \"promote more efficiency and result in a greater output,\" they benefited the company as much as the workers and should therefore be counted as work time. As for the phrase coffee break, it entered the vernacular through a 1952 advertising campaign by the Pan-American Coffee Bureau, a trade group organized by Central American growers. Their slogan: \"Give yourself a coffee-break ... and get what coffee gives to you.\"\n\nRead: The case for drinking as much coffee as you like\n\nNear the end of Coffeeland, Sedgewick attempts to quantify exactly how much value a pound of coffee gives an employer (or, put another way, extracts from an employee), using Los Wigwam and Hill's plantation as examples. He estimates that it takes 1.5 hours of Salvadoran labor to produce a pound of coffee. That's enough to make 40 cups of coffee, or supply two coffee breaks for Wigwam's 20 employees, which Greinetz calculated yielded the equivalent of 30 additional hours of labor. In other words, the six cents that Hill's plantation paid for an hour and a half of labor in 1954 was transformed into $22.50 worth of value for Phil Greinetz, an alchemy that reflects both the remarkable properties of caffeine and the brute facts of exploitation.\n\nBut the symbiotic relationship that coffee and capitalism have enjoyed for the past several centuries may now be coming to a sad close. Coffea arabica is a picky plant, willing to grow only in the narrowest range of conditions: Sunlight, water, drainage, and even altitude all have to be just so. The world has only so many places suitable for coffee production. Climate scientists estimate that at least half of the acreage now producing coffee -- and an even greater proportion in Latin America -- will be unable to support the plant by 2050, making coffee one of the crops most immediately endangered by climate change. Capitalism may be killing the golden goose.\n\nYet capitalism is nothing if not resourceful. Employers who now offer coffee breaks might, someday soon, instead hand out tablets of synthetic caffeine, one in the morning, another in the afternoon. This would offer the employer several advantages. Pills are cheaper than coffee, and less messy. And because they take mere seconds to ingest, the coffee break itself would no longer be necessary, giving the company every reason to claw back the 30 precious minutes the courts bequeathed to the American worker 64 years ago. The fate of the coffee workers in El Salvador will likely be far worse, but perhaps the \"veins of nourishment\" -- nature's edible bounty -- will flow again after the monocultures of coffee collapse.\n\nThis article appears in the April 2020 print edition with the headline \"The World's Favorite Drug.\"\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

The car's 296bhp comes courtesy of twin electric motors and a 1.6-litre four-cylinder petrol engine.\n\nThe Grandland X can drive on purely electric power for up to 35 miles at up to 84mph (or 146mph with all guns blazing), and as most car journeys are only seven or eight miles, Vauxhall claims 80 per cent of buyers will be able to do most of their driving without bothering the petrol engine at all.\n\nHowever, when you do feel the need, the car's three power sources give it impressive shove as well as four-wheel-drive. Nought to 60mph takes just 5.9 seconds, and in the top-spec Ultimate Nav version which we tested, there is also a paddle shift gearchange for when you are feeling playful.\n\nUnder the skin this is the same car as a Peugeot 3008 SUV, which is no bad thing. However, the Vauxhall's cabin, although reasonably well finished, is nothing like as interesting as the Peugeot's, with its tactile controls and digital instrument cluster. The Grandland makes do with analogue dials and restrained piano black detailing.\n\nThe styling is also less interesting than the Peugeot. The front has Vauxhall's neat corporate look but the rear looks indistinguishable from a dozen other SUVs.\n\nIt is always difficult to assess accurately what sort of fuel consumption this type of hybrid vehicle will achieve because it is all a matter of how it is used. Vauxhall claim 204mpg, while our test car's computer said it was doing about 42mpg.\n\nWhile the Grandland does have four-wheel-drive it is not an all-out off-roader, but we tried the car over very boggy conditions on a special course in Windsor Great Park and it felt sure-footed and never in any danger of getting stuck in the mud. And that was on ordinary road tyres.\n\nOn the road the car feels poised and comfortable and the cabin is roomy if a bit bland. The eight-speed auto gearbox on our test car worked smoothly and it pulls off the tricky task of being happy to pootle about quietly in electric mode or producing beefy acceleration and 520Nm of torque when required.","259":"Care to Share Which Non-Photographers Influence and Inspire You? | I get it. Ansel Adams inspires you. Perhaps Bresson, and maybe Gursky too. But there's another world of creative geniuses outside the realms of photography where you can draw creative ideas and energy from. Here are two people that influence me.\n\nWhen I was younger, I wasn't really into photography. Through my school years and all through my time at university I was far more interested in drawing, particularly sketching, comic characters, and surfing scenes. Through those experiences, I learnt about things such as vanishing points, perspective, scale, and rules of composition such as the golden spiral and the rule of thirds. However, as I got busier in life and I started working and traveling, I found I didn't really have the time to do much drawing and I was attracted to the immediacy of photography.\n\nAs such, I can't say I had any great photographic influences in terms of particular individuals. To be honest, I'd never even heard of Ansel Adams when I bought my first digital camera in my early 20s, so I can't really say he was a great influence on me, especially considering he shot in film and mostly around Yosemite National Park in the United States. What I can say with certainty with regards to Adams is that I highly value his desire to continually push himself further and come up with concepts that weren't common place at the time. His ability in the dark room is legendary, as is his zoning system, which is still used in the digital era today.\n\nTo that end, he has been a great influence on me because I admire and respect people who are always pushing themselves beyond the boundaries of normalcy and trying to come up with ideas and techniques that are beyond what is generally accepted at the time or different from what most other people are doing. And that brings us to the topic of influences we derive inspiration from outside the specific world of photography. I'm going to introduce two people today who I admire and explain why they've had an impact on me and how they have helped to shape my approach to photography.\n\nTash Sultana in the studio. Photo: Dara Munnis\n\nThe first is a singer\/songwriter from Australia named Tash Sultana. She's only 24 years old now but has already received a lot of critical acclaim and commercial success. It's not so much that I absolutely adore her music, it's more the fact that she is literally a one person band. Indeed, if you look at the blurb on her debut album on iTunes it says that she wrote, arranged, produced, and played all 15 instruments during its creation. They include the guitar, the saxophone, the trumpet, the pan flute, the mandolin, and the drums, among others. To see her play is wonderfully inspiring because not only is she adept with a vast array of instruments, but she plays them all so unbelievably well. It's one thing to play a lot of instruments, but to also arrange them and put them together to make songs that are critically acclaimed and well received by the wider public is an inconceivably difficult task for most, but at 24 she has done it all.\n\nThis inspires and influences my photography because it reminds me not to box myself into one particular genre. I have always loved the ocean and lived near the ocean so I can get a little swept up in seascape photography or surfing photography and sometimes I feel like I'm becoming one-dimensional. But when I look at someone like Tash Sultana and see how she finds inspiration in different instruments, it helps me to explore different areas of photography and to push myself to improve in areas that I'm not particularly good at, or find ideas and elements of creativity in genres of photography that I might have previously dismissed or ignored.\n\nThe second person who really inspires me is a guy called Steven Sawyer. To those outside the surfing world, he's probably a name you've never heard of, but I genuinely respect him because of the way he's been able to adapt to, and recognize the world and industry in which he lives. He grew up surfing in South Africa riding a shortboard at a famous surfing break called Jeffreys Bay. He was very talented and had continued success in national junior competitions, but making a living from shortboarding in the current surfing industry is very difficult and very cutthroat. So what did he do? He took up longboarding, which is an entirely different style and approach to riding waves, particularly with regards to the way they're both judged in competitions. For anyone who's tried both, you would know that they are worlds apart and it is not simple to switch from one to the other, least of all at an elite level. However, not only did Sawyer make the switch from shortboarding to longboarding, he went on to win the world longboarding championship in 2018.\n\nNot only are longboards about three times as heavy as shortboards, they're about three times as difficult to turn quickly too. The Pass, in Australia's Byron Bay.\n\nThis had a great impact on me in terms of my photography because it reinforced the notion that you can't always steadfastly stick to what you love and enjoy if it's patently clear that you're not going to make a living from it (if that's what you want to do.) Sawyer is incredibly talented at shortboarding but he recognized early that he might not have been quite able to get to that high, elite level in order to carve out a career, so he made the conscious decision to switch to longboarding. And while it's not as lucrative as shortboarding, he has been able to create a nice existence for himself and market himself and his band through his longboarding success.\n\nThis is a reminder to all of us in the photography world that we might have some particular styles of photography that we love and are genuinely passionate about, but if they don't pay the bills we have to be honest about that and understand that we might have to put those passions to one side if we want to receive a salary from our photographic endeavors. After all, sunsets and flowers don't pay for many of us, so we need to find ways in which we can use our knowledge and skills in photography to help us put a roof over our heads and money in our bank accounts.\n\nSumming Up\n\nIt's natural to draw inspiration from people who are closely associated with your interests, especially with regards to photography. But creativity lives abundantly throughout modern society and there are endless places and individuals to draw ideas from. Today, I've shared two of many who I admire and try to emulate in certain ways. I'd love to hear about people outside the photography world who have shaped your photographic journey.

On top of the nail-biting cliffhanger of yesterday's penultimate episode, AMC released an extended sneak peek for the concluding chapter that reveals Lauren Cohan is about to return as Maggie at long last.\n\nAs part of a moving montage set to a speech by Father Gabriel about how there are others out there who will help them, Maggie is shown reading an old letter from Carol. The shot lingers just long enough on the letter for us to see that it explains all about the Whisperers. Maggie looks up, and we're left to assume that she's going to come back home to aid her old friends in their battle with Beta and his army.\n\nIf you study the sneak peek, you can make out a pretty full picture of what the letter says. Here's the opening paragraph, in which Carol pleads for Maggie to return.\n\n\"Maggie, you need to come back. Jesus is dead. So is Tara. Enid. My son. They were murdered by a group called the Whisperers. Have you heard of them? They wear the skins of the dead and move in herds. Live with the dead,\" the letter reads. \"...When you come across walkers you need to watch hands for knives. Do not underestimate them.\"\n\nMuch of the rest of the letter is illegible, but we can next make out the phrases \"Alpha slaughtered\" and \"mark her border\". This passage no doubt refers to the massacre of ten survivors from the communities, including three Hilltop residents, that occurred in season 9's penultimate episode. Carol goes on to say that Alpha \"threatens to overrun us\" with her legion of walkers.\n\nCohan left the show midway through season 9, with the intention always being that she would return at some point. And that point is coming in the season 10 finale. The only thing is we don't know when it's going to air. Rest assured, though, The Walking Dead will be back - and so will Maggie.","261":"Carrie Symonds fears: Prayers pour in for pregnant fianc\u00e9e as Boris admitted to ICU Some people pointed out how this must be a \"terrifying moment\" for her and she would no doubt need \"someone's hand to hold\".\n\nOne person wrote: \"Wishing our Prime Minister the very best & a full speedy recovery.\n\n\"My thoughts & best wishes to his family, especially his fianc\u00e9e Carrie Symonds who must be going through the hardest of times with their first child due later in the year.\"\n\nJemima Goldsmith said: \"This must be a terrifying time for @carriesymonds.","262":"Cashflow: Musiccentro Ltd Name: Musiccentro Ltd\n\nCity: London\n\nWebsite: musiccentro.com\n\nMusiccentro is an online sales platform where artists, producers and managers can showcase their music and sell commercial licences to other musicians and businesses.\n\nWe are unique in that we professionalise the amateur music market and help independent musicians to earn a living by servicing them with fully automated sales tools.

While Christmas may be the most celebrated, Lent is the more solemnly observed as it leads up to the most significant holy day for Christians, Easter -- the celebration of the resurrection of Christ. This 40-day observance starts with Ash Wednesday, or the day when Catholics are marked with ash to be reminded that man \"comes from dust and dust he shall return.\" The ensuing five weeks is observed with prayer, fasting, and abstinence. And all Catholics are encouraged to repent and go to confession at this time.\n\nAs an institution that has existed for hundreds of years, it comes as no surprise that the Catholic Church is adapting to the times and has taken advantage of technology and the convenience of the cellphone to reach the faithful. Here are ten apps devout Catholics may find useful, especially in this season of prayer and contemplation.\n\nLaudate is a free Catholic app that offers just about everything a Catholic needs. It is basically a prayer app with significant add-ons. It offers the more formal prayers, like Daily Bible readings, Liturgy of the Hours, The Rosary, the Stations of the Cross, and even some Latin Prayers (with English translations). It also has the Douay-Rheims Bible for offline use, cathechism, and a convenient confession feature. It even has a section on Vatican documents, featuring the Second Vatican Council, the Code of Canon Law, and papal encyclicals.\n\nLaudate claims to be \"The most popular and most comprehensive free Catholic App\" which is available in 17 languages, including Filipino. For the serious Catholic, this is the go-to app.\n\nOne might call Formed on Demand the Catholic Netflix. This is an app for various streaming content all focused on the faith. Participating producers are veritable institutions in Catholic media, like the Augustine Institute, Catholic Answers, Eternal Word Television Network (EWTN), FOCUS, Ignatius Press, Knights of Columbus, Marian Press, Sophia Press, St. Paul Center, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), and many more. Formed On Demand features movies, children's programming, audio dramas and books, as well as Bible studies, sacramental prep materials, documentaries, books and audio talks from leading Catholic experts.\n\nFormed On Demand is available on Google Play, the Apple App Store for a free one-week trial, and a subscription of $9.99 per month. It can be accessed via mobile, tablet, or connected TV device with Roku, Apple TV, and Chromecast among others.\n\nThis is a daily prayer podcast based on Ignatian Spirituality. The main feature are daily 10-13-minute prayers have been written by Jesuits complemented with music. Catholics on the go will find this helpful when seeking \"peace\" during the daily commute.\n\nThe app does not stop there. Aside from the daily prayers, Pray As You Go also offers prayer tools for loneliness, insomnia, grief, depression, anxiety, ageing and addiction. The prayer tools also include a guide to praying the Rosary divided into the mysteries, and the Stations of the Cross. All the prayers come with either choir or contemplation music and quick reflection points.\n\nThe app is available for free on Google Play and the Apple App Store.\n\nSome Catholics prefer to refer to the Bible. What if the Bible is a full audio production, featuring more than 70 professional voice actors including Stacy Keach, Kristen Bell, Sean Astin, Brian Cox, Malcolm McDowell, Julia Ormond, John Rhys-Davies, Blair Underwood, and Michael York? Truth & Life offers this plus a study bible, news from the Catholic community, and content from EWTN.\n\nTruth & Life is an app available in iOS, Android, Kindle, Nook*, and PC that features the full New Testament of the Revised Standard Version of the Bible - Catholic Edition (RSV-CE), supplemented by the Ignatius Catholic Bible Study. It is endorsed by the Vatican with an Imprimatur, and a foreword by Pope Benedict XVI. It also has feeds from the Catholic News Agency and EWTN on Demand.\n\nFor a preview, the Gospel according to Mark is available for free along with the corresponding Study Bible. The whole pack can be purchased for $29.99, while packages of selected features can be accessed for $19.99.\n\nMany Catholics refer to the lectionary and the daily readings for a guide on which text to use in prayers for the day. For a convenient reference, the Magnificat app is the digital version of the missalette. It comes from the same publishers of those used in masses. Aside from the official texts for masses, this app also features prayers for morning, evening, and night inspired by the Liturgy of the Hours, meditations from the writings of Church Fathers and spiritual masters, and the profile of the saint of the day (based on feast days).\n\nThe app is free for those who subscribe to the printed format. For exclusive app-based users, it is available on Google Play and the Apple App Store for $1.99 per month.\n\nFor most people encountering challenges, one common response is to ask God why it is happening. In response, church leaders often recommend consulting the Bible for answers. This app is a digital resource to help the wondering Catholic find those answers more easily. Browse through the topics list and find out what the Bible says about any query. It has Bible quotes for more than 6,000 of the most asked questions. It also features articles explaining Bible verses which can be downloaded and bookmarked for future reference. If a question is not that common, there is an ask-a-question feature that lets the app sort through its database for possible answers.\n\nGot Questions? is available for free through the Apple App Store and Google Play.\n\nChildren cannot be left behind in this solemn season. Storybook Bible for Kids is an app that will both entertain them while letting them learn more about the Catholic faith. So far, this app features 35 stories with colorful illustrations talking about trust through the story of Abraham, bravery with Esther's, faithfulness with Paul's, and, of course, compassion with Jesus'. At the end of each story, there are questions that families can bond over with discussions.\n\nStorybook Bible For Kids is available for free through the Apple App Store and Google Play.\n\niDisciple is a ons-stop-app for the Catholic family. It features multimedia content from over 300 authors, speakers, and Christian organizations, including Daily Devotionals, sermons, articles, videos, music and more. The content is focused on just about every facet of the life of the faithful, including Adoption & Foster Care, the Bible, Career, Children\/Teens, Emerging Generation, Evangelism, Leadership, Life Challenges, Marriage, Men, Money, Parenting, Personal Productivity, Prayer, Purpose, Relationships, Spiritual Growth, Women., and more.\n\nThe app itself is free on the Apple App Store and Google Play with three audiobooks. The fourth book onwards can be purchased in-app from$4.99-$9.99.\n\nA significant part of Lent is the act of contrition. That's the entire exercise of examination of conscience, the confession, and the penance. This app is the digital guide to how to undergo this process more meaningfully for adults and children alike. It is based on the booklet, \"Short Guide for Confession\" by Fr. James Soc\u00edas which has become a popular reference for this sacrament. It features a helpful tip on the ideal confession, and a copy of the significant prayers for penance like the Act of Contrition, among others. For the conscientious Catholic, this app goes the extra mile and helps track when the last confession was done.\n\nConfesGuide is available for free through the Apple App Store and Google Play.\n\nWhile going through the heavy traffic of the daily commute, podcasts provide the ideal distraction. This is why Relevant Radio is the perfect app for the commuting Catholic. It has live streams of radio programs and podcasts for the faithful, including the Conversations with God show. It also offers audio prayers, a confession helper, daily readings, news for the Catholic community, and many more.\n\nRelevant Radio is available for free on the Apple App Store, Google Play Store, and Amazon.com.\n\nThis list is far from being comprehensive, but it has some of the most useful apps available for the faithful. There are many more apps that can be used, especially during this season of prayer and repentance, and many are free. With these apps, these days it is easy to keep the faith- it is as simple as being on a mobile phone.","264":"Centuries of prejudice means Gypsies and Travellers are still political targets today The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations\n\nThe Conservative Party's manifesto commitments to \"tackle unauthorised traveller camps\" and give police new powers to seize Travellers' property and vehicles play to an age-old view of travelling people as criminals. The manifesto argues this is \"to protect our communities\", resolutely placing Travellers outside a Tory concept of \"community\", and playing to centuries-old suspicions and prejudices.\n\nBritish Romani and Traveller people are wearyingly familiar with this political rhetoric as repeated in newspapers, on television and in the playground. In his magisterial The Stopping Places from 2018, Damian Le Bas described his relationship with travelling, with being a Traveller and to Britain. From a young age, he realised that \"the land I lived in would never allow me to forget that it saw the Gypsies as a people apart\". The Romani academic Ken Lee has pointed out that no matter when or where, Romanies have been seen as strangers.\n\nThe word \"Gypsy\" is an exonym derived from \"Egyptian\", which is how Romani people were described when the diaspora was first noted in Britain. The first record of Romanies in England is sometimes given as an inquest in 1514 that mentions an Egyptian woman, though there is also evidence for a much earlier presence. A 10th-century skeleton unearthed in Norwich has a DNA sequence matching a rare modern Romani lineage.\n\nRead more: Gypsies and Travellers 'clampdown' is less dog whistle, more political fog-horn\n\nAs well as being called Gypsies, British Romani people are often referred to (or refer to themselves) as Travellers. Irish Travellers in Britain and other travelling groups have a separate community history to Romani people, although laws, politics and attitudes have led them to share many experiences.\n\nThe stereotype of the Gypsy criminal is neither new, nor exclusive to Britain. Yet it has a disturbingly pernicious cultural power. As a document signifying attitudes and aspirations, the Conservative Party manifesto of 2019 joins a long list of representations - in law, the media, visual arts and fiction - that contribute to the false impression of Romanies or Travellers en masse as criminal outsiders.\n\nDifferent century, same attitude\n\nAlmost from the outset, Gypsies were subject to the force of the law. The Egyptians Act of 1554 introduced the death penalty for \"Egyptians\" who refused to leave the country. The Tudors wanted real control over who was coming in and out.\n\nAlmost two centuries later, on New Year's Day 1753, a teenage maidservant called Elizabeth Canning was apparently kidnapped from the City of London to be forced into prostitution in Enfield, some miles away. She claimed that, after several weeks in starving captivity, she escaped through a window. The woman who owned the brothel was sentenced to branding of the thumb, and Mary Squires, a Gypsy, who was said to have assisted, was sentenced to death by hanging.\n\nThe sensational media reporting of the time was sure of Squires's guilt because she was a Gypsy. But their stereotyping was wrong: Squires had an alibi and received a full pardon. Another story about the case mentioned a street-seller supposedly beaten and robbed by Gypsies as \"a further instance of their Barbarity to our Subjects, which shews the immediate Necessity of rooting these Villains out of their Dens\". In 1753 as in 2019, the easy line for the press to take was that \"our\" communities needed protecting from these criminal outsiders.\n\nA century later, and an 1865 painting by Thomas George Webster called The Gypsy hangs in the Smith Art Gallery in Brighouse, West Yorkshire. Webster's image portrays a dark-haired, sharp-faced Gypsy woman emerging from the foliage outside an open window, besides which a pale girl sits sewing. A small white pot on the windowsill is easily reachable through the window. The painted scene implies that the Gypsy woman will steal from the other, and the girl's expression suggests that the wide-open window suddenly seems a mistake.\n\nThis minor moment in art history may seem innocuous, but it is part of the steady drip, drip of cultural references in which Gypsies and Travellers are painted, metaphorically or literally, in a particular light. Throughout the 19th century, novels, poems and books for children portrayed Gypsies as suspect and to be feared.\n\nEach century has its Gypsy and Traveller suspects, across all cultural forms and varied audiences. It is no surprise that, with this cultural history, politicians claim again and again to want to take action against these groups' perceived criminality. The opposition of police forces to the Home Office's proposed policy on unauthorised encampments shows how much the Conservative's manifesto pledge is about image rather than well-researched policy. It is the same image that has been informed by centuries of fictional but powerful representation.\n\nThe British state does not need special protection from Romani and Traveller communities. With their social and cultural contributions to British life ignored or deemed worthless, it is Romani and Traveller people that need protecting from an over-zealous state.","265":"Champions League: Alisson Becker Ruled Out Of Liverpool's Atletico Madrid Showdown | Football News Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp says Brazil goalkeeper Alisson Becker will miss Wednesday's crucial Champions League clash against Atletico Madrid after suffering a hip injury. Alisson sustained the muscle problem in training this week and was sidelined for Liverpool's FA Cup fifth-round defeat at Chelsea on Tuesday. Scans confirmed the 27-year-old will be out for at least a week, starting with the leaders' Premier League match against Bournemouth on Saturday and including next week's last-16 second leg with Atletico.\n\nChampions League holders Liverpool face Atletico at Anfield trailing 1-0 after the first leg in Spain.\n\nKlopp hopes the injury is not serious, but he admitted Alisson may not return until after the international break later in March.\n\n\"Unfortunately Ali is out. He had a little incident in training before the Chelsea game,\" Klopp told reporters on Friday.\n\n\"We all thought it was nothing and it was clear he would not play anyway, the plan was he was on the bench.\n\n\"There, we thought, 'Come on, we don't have to take any risks' so left him out of the squad.\n\n\"There was a scan the next day and they found something. So now he is out. We will see next week for sure and then we will see.\n\n\"Next week no, that means Atletico. I don't want to say no (to the Merseyside derby on March 16) but I don't know if he will be available.\n\n\"He is not available for tomorrow and then the next week. We have to judge the situation anew.\n\n\"I would say after the international break 100 per cent. Whatever we can get before that, we will see.\"\n\nWith Alisson sidelined, Liverpool will have to rely on reserve 'keeper Adrian, whose mistake led to Chelsea's opening goal for Willian on Tuesday.","266":"Characterization of glacial silt and clay using automated mineralogy | Annals of Glaciology | Cambridge Core Glacial erosion produces vast quantities of fine-grained sediment that has a far-reaching impact on Earth surface processes. To gain a better understanding of the production of glacial silt and clay, we use automated mineralogy to quantify the microstructure and mineralogy of rock and sediment samples from 20 basins in the St. Elias Mountains, Yukon, Canada. Sediments were collected from proglacial streams, while rock samples were collected from ice marginal outcrops and fragmented using electrical pulse disaggregation. For both rock fragments and sediments, we observe a log-normal distribution of grain sizes and a sub-micrometer terminal grain size. We find that the abrasion of silt and clay results in both rounding and the exploitation of through-going fractures. The abundance of inter- versus intragranular fractures depends on mineralogy and size. Unlike the relatively larger grains, where crushing and abrasion are thought to exploit and produce discrete populations of grain sizes, the comminution of fines leads to a grain size, composition and rounding that is continuously distributed across size, and highly dependent on source-rock properties.","267":"Charge: Rift 'over money and fidelity' preceded Maple Grove man killing wife Witness said the husband wanted a divorce but was unwilling to divide the money and property equally, according to prosecutors.\n\nA 54-year-old man was in court Monday on charges that he fatally shot his wife in their Maple Grove home.\n\nJohn M.

Davidson was charged Tuesday in Washington County District Court with two counts of felony assault with a dangerous weapon and illegal possession of a firearm. He was released from jail the same day after posting $50,000 bail.\n\nA 20-year-old Oakdale man injured in the early morning altercation was also arrested on suspicion of assault, but later released without charges. The Star Tribune generally does not name suspects who have not been charged.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint:\n\nOakdale police were called to the scene at 6:18 a.m., where they found one man suffering from a gunshot wound to the chest and another shot in his left forearm at the hotel on 420 N. Inwood Av. Neither was cooperative with authorities,\n\nBoth men were taken to Regions Hospital in St. Paul with noncritical injuries. A hospital security guard told police that the younger man identified Davidson as the shooter when he rolled past the 20-year-old's room in a stretcher.\n\nIn an interview with investigators, Davidson's girlfriend admitted to renting the room and inviting two friends to visit. The gathering snowballed when four men arrived for a party and started drinking. Jordana Berg-Obrecht, 22, told authorities that she felt uncomfortable when the 20-year-old guest began touching her and attempting to dance. Eventually, she told the men to leave because Davidson was coming over. But everyone stayed.\n\nBerg-Obrecht met Davidson outside the hotel and the couple came back upstairs together, when she suddenly heard a loud bang. Davidson yelled about a pain in his arm and they fled into the elevator together.\n\nHe then handed her the gun and surveillance cameras caught her holding an object against her side, charges say. She admitted to dumping it outside the building moments later. Police recovered the loaded .45 caliber handgun beside a tree on the west side of the hotel.\n\nBerg-Obrecht was charged Thursday with aiding and abetting and illegal possesion of a firearm, both felonies.\n\nA male witness told detectives that Davidson had come into the room carrying a duffel bag. He threatened the witness and the 20-year-old Oakdale man with his gun and told them to leave, court records show. The witness reportedly grabbed the barrel of the gun and pushed it away as Davidson squeezed off a single round. Davidson was shot through the forearm while the other man was struck in the chest.\n\nA 17-year-old witness surmised that the altercation began over the \"theft of alcohol and cigarettes,\" according to a search warrant affidavit.\n\nCrime scene technicians combing the hotel room found bloody towels, a \"mushroomed\" .45- caliber slug on the ground of the hallway and blood spatter on the walls.\n\nDavidson has a previous felony conviction for theft. In that 2018 incident, he was found guilty of stealing more than $1,200 in clothing from a Macy's department store.","269":"Chelsea vs Everton: Chelsea Crush Everton To Cement Top Four Place In Premier League | Football News Chelsea powered to their biggest Premier League win of the season and cemented their place in the top four as Mason Mount and Pedro inspired a 4-0 demolition of Everton on Sunday. Frank Lampard's side won for just the second time in seven league games thanks to goals from Mount, Pedro, Willian and Olivier Giroud in a masterful display at Stamford Bridge.\n\nChelsea, in fourth place, are now five points clear of fifth-placed Wolves and with nine matches to play they are in pole position to qualify for the Champions League.\n\nIt was an vibrant end to a much-needed week of good news for Lampard, whose side knocked out Liverpool out in the FA Cup fifth round on Tuesday.\n\nRocked by a Champions League last 16 hammering by Bayern Munich and a series of spluttering domestic results, Chelsea were in danger of losing the feelgood factor created by Lampard's blooding of so many promising youngsters in his first season.\n\nAn injury crisis robbed Lampard of eight senior players this weekend.\n\nBut, despite absences including Tammy Abraham, N'Golo Kante and Mateo Kovacic, this was exactly the kind of energetic, clinical performance Lampard has urged his team to produce.\n\nMount and Pedro were livewires in the final third, while 18-year-old Billy Gilmour impressed on his first Premier League start.\n\nEverton's hopes of reaching the Champions League are fading fast after three games without a victory.\n\nTheir boss Carlo Ancelotti was back at Chelsea as a manager for the first time since being sacked in 2011.\n\nAncelotti won the Premier League and FA Cup with Chelsea in 2010 and was favourite of Lampard during his two-year reign.\n\nBut Lampard had already beaten one old mentor in Jose Mourinho this season and Chelsea were quickly on top against another of his teachers.\n\nPace and precision\n\nGiroud headed onto Willian and his cross picked out the run of Mount, whose agile half-volley forced a fine save from Jordan Pickford.\n\nChelsea were sharper than Everton in all areas and took the lead in the 14th minute with a flowing 20-pass move.\n\nGilmour, so composed again after shining against Liverpool, quickened the tempo as he fed Mount, who worked the ball wide for the overlapping Pedro.\n\nPedro picked out Mount's astute run to the edge of the Everton area and the 21-year-old midfielder turned away from Tom Davies to drill a fine low strike past Pickford for his first goal since December.\n\nHaving delivered his first Premier League assist of the season, Pedro was in the groove and he bagged his first top-flight goal since February 2019 in the 21st minute.\n\nOnce again Chelsea moved with pace and precision.\n\nGilmour and Giroud teed up Ross Barkley for a defence-splitting pass that set Pedro clear and the Spanish winger kept his cool to slot past Pickford.\n\nBarkley enjoyed the goal almost as much as Pedro as the former Everton star silenced the jeers from his old fans.\n\nDominic Calvert-Lewin was given a new contract this week after scoring eight times under Ancelotti, but the Everton striker poked tamely wide from Richarlison's pass.\n\nPickford kept out Giroud's long-range blast, but Chelsea were in complete control and Willian, who shook off an Achilles problem to start, put the result beyond doubt in the 51st minute.\n\nPedro and Barkley exchanged passes to find Willian, who took advantage of the space left by Everton's sluggish defence as the Brazilian fired home from 20 yards.\n\nGiroud added to Everton's misery three minutes later when he escaped Mason Holgate's slack marking to turn in Willian's cross for his third goal of the season.\n\nWith Chelsea cruising, Lampard gave teenagers Faustino Anjorin and Armando Broja their league debuts as late substitutes.","270":"Cheteshwar Pujara Responds To Fuss Over His Strike Rate In Test Matches | Cricket News Cheteshwar Pujara finds the constant fuss over his strike rate a tad unfair and wants to clarify once and for all that he has got full backing of the team management which understands the \"importance\" of his style of play. In the age of slam-bang cricket, Pujara brings delight to the purists of the game by batting on and on without worrying too much about the strike-rate. But to appreciate someone who epitomises patience in Test cricket is may be asking for too much from the \"millennials\". Last week, the soft-spoken 32-year-old from Rajkot found himself at the receiving end again on social media as he laboured his way to 66 off 237 balls in the Ranji Trophy final against Bengal.\n\nTo his credit, he overcame fever and throat infection to share a game-changing stand with Arpit Vasavada, helping Saurashtra to their maiden title on the basis of first innings lead.\n\nWhether it is playing for Saurashtra or India, Pujara is used to constant chatter around his strike-rate.\n\n\"I don't think there is too much talk (on the inside). In media, it is described differently but the team management has been backing me on this completely. There is no pressure from the captain, coach or anyone else,\" Pujara, who is currently getting much-needed family time due to the COVID-19 outbreak, told PTI.\n\n\"I just want to clarify that when it comes to strike rate people start pointing towards team management's take on it but there is no pressure on me at all. The team management understands my style of play and its importance.\"\n\nFor someone who averages 48.66 in 77 Tests, perception counts for little.\n\n\"The question that was asked on social media (during Ranji final) was 'why am I taking so long to score X number of runs'? Whether I pay attention to that, no, I don't. My job is to make sure that the team wins at all times.\n\n\"People have this tendency to pinpoint one person but it is just not about me. If you look at any Test series where I have scored runs and taken little bit of time, the opposition batsmen, most of them, have consumed same number of balls.\n\n\"I know I can't be a David Warner or Virender Sehwag but if a normal batsman takes time there is nothing wrong in that.\"\n\nThe entire batting unit had a tough time in New Zealand with the 0-2 loss in Tests marking the end of the international season.\n\nPujara collected five half centuries this season, including one in New Zealand, but could not add to his 18 hundreds.\n\n\"People expect big knocks from me. I always challenge myself to score a 100 but to average close to 50 in Tests means you are scoring a half-century almost every second innings.\n\n\"My standards are always high and I am not satisfied with the season that I had but I would not call it a bad one at all.\"\n\nIt may be boring and exhausting for majority of the fans, batting time and wearing out the opposition excites Pujara the most. Asked why they don't make it like him anymore, Pujara gave a practical response.\n\n\"I don't think it is on the decline (art of batting time). There is value for it. May be the youngsters are not inclined towards this format. It is a fact that there are more games in white-ball cricket. A youngster would want to play shorter formats because it is financially better.\n\n\"There is nothing wrong with that but they should understand that real cricket is Test cricket and you will be judged only on the performances in the five-day game.\"\n\nWith uncertainty over the upcoming county season in the UK due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Pujara has no game time lined up in the near future.\n\nThe biggest international assignment for him this season is the tour of Australia and he can't be more fired up for that.\n\nRather than focusing on the loss in New Zealand, Pujara looked at the Australian challenge, especially after India's historic triumph Down Under last year.\n\n\"It is one of the most important series for us.\"\n\nOn playing a full-strength Australia this time, he said: \"They (Smith and Warner) are important players but if we played the way we played in the last series, we should be able to beat them.\n\n\"Fast bowlers have to be fresh and ready for that series and I am sure their workload will be managed. Best part about the tour is that we recently played in Australia (2018-19). I feel that is the biggest advantage for us.\"\n\nPujara acknowledges that no team, including India, is doing consistently well overseas and picked the reducing pool of quality Test cricketers as the reason for this trend.\n\n\"The importance of limited overs cricket has increased significantly. You are not getting too many quality Test players. Earlier, there was a lot of importance given to a Test series. Players used to take ample rest before that. Now we see so many injuries during the season.\n\n\"If you look India, Australia, England, the pool of players will be not more than 20-25 whereas if you talk about 10 years ago, India used to have 30-50 players who were ready for Test cricket. I am not saying there are no players available. But if they are ready for Test cricket or not, that is the question.\"\n\nOver the past 24 months, India have lost Test series in England, South Africa and New Zealand.\n\nPujara said the batsmen's shot selection could have been better in New Zealand where they were completely outplayed.","271":"Chicagoland Arab American journalist buried after succumbing to CHICAGO: Jordanian American newspaper publisher Mansour Tadros, who died on Mar. 28 at the age of 70 after falling ill with a suspected case of COVID-19, was buried on Tuesday.\n\nHis funeral was unusual, given the precautionary measures to slow the spread of the pandemic. Only close family could attend a memorial service at Lawn Funeral Home in Tinley Park, Illinois. Restrictions imposed by the state's governor, J. B. Pritzker, meant that other friends, relatives and mourners had to wait outside in their cars.\n\nAfter the service, more than 70 vehicles formed a funeral procession that drove past Tadros's home and on to Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Worth, the final resting place of many of Chicago's Christian Arabs.\n\nThe interment ceremony was likewise limited to immediate family, a priest and employees of the funeral home, all wearing face masks.\n\nWhen the service was completed, the family members got into their cars and the other mourners paid their final respects by driving slowly past. Tadros's sons, Fadi and Faris, acknowledged them from inside their car.\n\n\"We are so grateful to everyone who attended,\" said Mansour's sobbing wife, Lidya, who sat in a car with her daughter, Nadine, as the mourners went by, offering their condolences. \"This is so difficult for us.\"\n\nTadros, a cofounder of the National Arab American Journalists Association, was a giant in the Arab American journalism community. According to NAAJA, the Arab American and Muslim print media in America was badly affected by the 9\/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, with many Arab ethnic and Muslim publications forced to close due to discrimination.\n\nThis prompted Tadros to launch The Future News in 2002. He advocated for more to be done to educate Americans about the true face of Arab culture, and highlight the fact that it is rich, diverse and embedded in the foundations of many great achievements of mankind, including science, math and language.\n\nHowever, it was a struggle to keep his newspaper financially afloat and he often paid the publication costs out of his own pocket. Last year he shifted the operation to online-only.\n\nOne of his priorities was to make The Future News the \"newspaper of record\" for Chicago's Arab American community, which began to settle in the city following the 1893 World's Fair.\n\nTadros and his parents immigrated to the US in 1968 from Na'ur, a suburb of Amman in Jordan. He was very active in the Jordanian American and Palestinian American communities. Many of those who knew and worked with him paid tribute to his life and work.\n\n\"Mansour was a man that lived and worked constantly on behalf of our Arab American community,\" said Nemer Ziyad, CEO of Ziyad Brothers Importing, \"That was his life and that will be his legacy.\n\n\"He had no boundaries, no matter where in the Arab world someone was from, nor what religion they were. He was always about the community and always on the front line with any situation, even financially.\"\n\nhe added that Tadros was \"constantly helping people and families,\" often dipping into his own resources and funds to do so.\n\n\"He was always helping people in need,\" Ziyad said. \"Mansour was an iconic man. He was respected in our community and by many others for his work. And he was loved by all he touched. He will be missed. His passing is a major loss to our community and society. He will never be forgotten.\"\n\nMarie Newman, who recently unseated incumbent Dan Lipinski in the Democratic Primary for Illinois's 3rd Congressional District, recalled how he had helped and advised her.\n\n\"I am heartbroken about Mansour,\" she said. \"He was a great counselor and mentor to me. I will miss our long conversations. This a huge loss for all.\"\n\nThe Future News endorsed Newman in the hotly contested congressional race. After her victory, Tadros predicted she would be a champion of civil rights for all residents, including Arab Americans.\n\nSt. Mary's Orthodox Church Pastor Malek Rihani described Tadros as a man of faith.\n\n\"I've had the pleasure of working with Mansour a few times, and his focus has always been finding ways to strengthen our community by giving us a voice through his gift of journalism,\" he said.\n\nTadros also worked closely with the Arab American Democratic Club (. Its chairman, Samir Khalil, said: \"I knew Mansour and his parents and siblings for 50 years. I talked to him on the phone the night before his passing; he was in good spirits talking about Marie Newman winning, how happy he was and looking forward to helping unite the community.\n\n\"Mansour and I were active in college together as he was my schoolmate, and we kept working together, supporting each other to support the community for the past 50 years, on many occasions. I wish all activists in our community were like Mansour. If he disagreed with you, he always remained your loyal friend, with class.\n\n\"I loved him and loved the way he operated: very supportive, genuine, sincere and he got things done.\"\n\nActivists and former newspaper publishers Abder and Amani Ghouleh also paid tribute.\n\n\"Mansour was a man who was always there for the Arab American community,\" they said. \"He consistently volunteered his time, funds and advice to help many causes.\n\n\"His compassion and love for others was there to the very end, as he checked on many of his friends during this difficult time in the world. It was our honor to serve with him on...many ad hoc activist committees, as well as being his colleagues in local community journalism.\"\n\nFormer Cook County Illinois Judge William Haddad described Tadros as a \"great community leader.\"\n\n\"The Arab-American community has lost a great friend. Mansour was a leader, an activist, a journalist and a man who loved his heritage and defended it I knew him as a colleague who worked with us not for himself, but for our people.\"","272":"Chris Farrell: Does a new house at 56 make sense? Q: My wife and I are planning to build a house. I'm 56 and my wife is 60. Here's where I need perspective: The dream home, although of modest size, is to be very energy efficient and architecturally distinctive (I'm an architect and the design is a personal expression). I'm sure that the house, garage and site costs will be in the $600,000 range. I can't yet get my head around the whole deal leaving us with a new $450,000 mortgage How can we get a sense of the likely selling price, mortgage premiums vs. other investments, etc.?\n\nA: That's a lot of debt to take on as you enter into the traditional retirement years. A \u00adsensible financial guideline for homeowners is to have paid off the mortgage by the time you near retirement. What's more, while you can make reasonable assumptions about home values over the next decade or so, you can't get rid of the uncertainty, including the swings in the business cycle, changes in consumer preferences concerning shelter, and so on.\n\nYou could buy a small condo in the Twin Cities and bank a fair amount of money from the sale of your existing home. It also matters how much in other assets you have to support the debt.\n\nThat said, I would run two tests on the wisdom of building your dream home. The first test is thinking through its opportunity cost. Whenever you make a decision to do something -- like build a new home -- you foreclose using the money and time for other purposes (such as travel). The value of the goods and services you sacrifice in making a choice is its opportunity cost, which helps us better understand the return we expect from our choices.\n\nIf you go this route, you might not be able to travel or pursue other bucket-list projects. Your time and your money will go into the home. Are the trade-offs worth it?\n\nThe other test is to focus on risk or, more accurately, which risks you're more comfortable living with. The key question is always \"What's the downside? What could go wrong?\" I would ask your financial adviser to run some worst-case scenarios to gain a grasp of your degree of financial vulnerability.\n\nThinking through its opportunity cost and crunching the numbers to understand your downside risk should help guide you toward a sensible decision.\n\nChris Farrell is senior economics contributor, Marketplace, and economics commentator, Minnesota Public Radio.","273":"Chronic mild stress alters synaptic plasticity in the nucleus accumbens through GSK3\u03b2-dependent modulation of Kv4.2 channels GSK3\u03b2 is a serine\/threonine kinase highly expressed in the brain that regulates several ion channels and receptors. Our study uncovers increased levels of active GSK3\u03b2 in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of mice with a depressive-like phenotype induced by chronic stress. We clarify that the increased levels of active GSK3\u03b2 within the NAc of these mice lead to altered synaptic plasticity through phosphorylation of the Kv4.2 subunit, a molecular determinant of A-type K+ currents. Moreover, selective GSK3\u03b2 silencing in the NAc prevents maladaptive synaptic plasticity and depression-related behavior, paving the way to consider the GSK3\u03b2-Kv4.2 axis as a strategy to manage the negative impact of chronic stress.\n\nAlthough major depressive disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent, its pathophysiology is poorly understood. Recent evidence suggests that glycogen-synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) plays a key role in memory formation, yet its role in mood regulation remains controversial. Here, we investigated whether GSK3\u03b2 activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is associated with depression-like behaviors and synaptic plasticity. We performed whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc and determined the role of GSK3\u03b2 in spike timing-dependent long-term potentiation (tLTP) in the chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) mouse model of depression. To assess the specific role of GSK3\u03b2 in tLTP, we used in vivo genetic silencing by an adeno-associated viral vector (AAV2) short hairpin RNA against GSK3\u03b2. In addition, we examined the role of the voltage-gated potassium Kv4.2 subunit, a molecular determinant of A-type K currents, as a potential downstream target of GSK3\u03b2. We found increased levels of active GSK3\u03b2 and augmented tLTP in CUMS mice, a phenotype that was prevented by selective GSK3\u03b2 knockdown. Furthermore, knockdown of GSK3\u03b2 in the NAc ameliorated depressive-like behavior in CUMS mice. Electrophysiological, immunohistochemical, biochemical, and pharmacological experiments revealed that inhibition of the Kv4.2 channel through direct phosphorylation at Ser-616 mediated the GSK3\u03b2-dependent tLTP changes in CUMS mice. Our results identify GSK3\u03b2 regulation of Kv4.2 channels as a molecular mechanism of MSN maladaptive plasticity underlying depression-like behaviors and suggest that the GSK3\u03b2-Kv4.2 axis may be an attractive therapeutic target for MDD.","274":"City councils across Minnesota go remote to avoid COVID-19 spread Council members meet via phone, and ask public to weigh in from afar, too.\n\nSt. Paul City Council members held their last in-person meeting for the foreseeable future on Wednesday, leaving empty seats between them at the council dais to preserve 6 feet of separation.\n\n\"We're in the midst of a pandemic, where the only way we can slow it is by not being close to each other,\" said Council Member Chris Tolbert.\n\nTypically bustling with elected officials, government staffers and members of the public, City Halls across the state are going quiet as leaders opt to meet remotely and urge their constituents to stay home to protect against the spread of COVID-19.\n\nAfter their regular meeting, most St. Paul council members walked down the hall to another room for training on video conference calls -- how they will conduct public meetings going forward. Council President Amy Brendmoen and a few staff members stayed behind in the council chambers and waited for video and audio to be patched through.\n\nAfter some trial and error, everyone got their laptops working. After completing a practice roll-call, they cheered.\n\n\"It's imperfect but it's pretty darn cool, to tell you the truth,\" Brendmoen said.\n\nMinnesota's open-meeting law, which requires government meetings to be open to the public, allows meetings to be held by phone or other electronic means in the event of a health pandemic.\n\nFor the first part of the week, Minneapolis City Council meetings happened as usual, except that council members sat farther apart and fewer people were in the audience. On Thursday, council members will be able to participate remotely.\n\nThe city has postponed advisory committee meetings scheduled through mid-April as part of an effort to encourage social distancing. That timeline could be extended depending on how the virus spreads, according to City Clerk Casey Carl.\n\nMinneapolis Park Board commissioners and staff planned to call in to their Wednesday evening meeting.\n\nSt. Paul is postponing public hearings that are expected to draw a crowd, including a controversial tenant-protection ordinance rescheduled for May 20. Officials are figuring out a process for other hearings.\n\n\"If there are items that appear to be larger-scale that can be pushed down the road, we'll do that,\" Brendmoen said. \"Trying to manage even 10 people at a public hearing is different than having one person be able to phone in and share their perspective on a zoning matter or something that's not controversial.\"\n\nIn Duluth, where City Hall is closed to the public, council members will be able to call in to upcoming meetings and public comments will be taken by e-mail. In Golden Valley, where council members met by video conference call for the first time Tuesday, residents are able to call in for public hearings.\n\nGolden Valley Mayor Shep Harris said the council had a light agenda -- and only one resident called in to testify -- but the meeting still lasted 45 minutes. \"We just have to be patient and realize that all of these items are going to take longer,\" he said.\n\nStaff writers Liz Navratil, Miguel Ot\u00e1rola, Katie Galioto and Mara Klecker contributed to this report.","275":"City of Ottawa accused of going too far with ticketing blitz to enforce physical distancing rules This translation has been automatically generated and has not been verified for accuracy. Full Disclaimer\n\nThe Canadian Civil Liberties Association has criticized the City of Ottawa for overzealous ticketing to reinforce physical distancing rules, following a weekend blitz.\n\nIn an open letter to Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson and Ottawa Police Chief Peter Sloly, CCLA President Michael Bryant wrote Monday that police and bylaw officers should be educating, informing and then warning people before issuing tickets under the Emergency Management and Civil Protection Act for disobeying guidelines aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\"The point is to achieve compliance with public health goals, not drive up your municipal revenues through a ticket blitz,\" Mr. Bryant wrote.\n\nThere have been complaints in multiple cities of authorities being too stringent in their enforcement of new rules, including concerns about the ticketing of homeless individuals in Toronto and Hamilton. and a women in Montreal who faced fines after a crowd gathered to sing Happy Birthday to her. Though he knew of some of these complaints, Mr. Bryant said in a phone interview that the majority of complaints he heard were from Ottawa.\n\nMr. Bryant said he appreciates there are cases where people are flagrantly disobeying the guidelines, and agrees fines may be warranted in those cases. But \"the point of emergency management today is public health, not public order, at least when public order means cracking down on heretofore harmless outdoor activity,\" he wrote.\n\nAnthony Di Monte, who oversees the City of Ottawa's bylaw services, said the city received more than 500 complaints over the weekend and issued only 43 citations. Mayor Jim Watson added that the city did try to educate residents for two weeks, \"but we had a bar that was open, we had a garage sale, we had kids' birthday parties. ... And this has to stop.\"\n\nOttawa City Councillor Shawn Menard agreed the blitz was potentially \"a bit overboard.\"\n\n\"There needs to be a recognition that everyone is just learning how to behave in this new world,\" Mr. Menard said. \"These are not criminals ... these are people adjusting to a very, very odd time in our history.\"\n\nOne resident, David Martinek, told the Globe he took his four-year-old son to an empty grassy patch near their home on Sunday afternoon. After kicking a ball around for 15 minutes, he noticed a bylaw officer pull up and begin writing down his license plate information. When Mr. Martinek approached the officer to clarify whether the space was even a public park, the officer abruptly told him \"it's a $700 fine,\" and drove away. Mr. Martinek was not handled a physical ticket, but thought one might arrive in the mail. Asked about this case, the city said that it \"cannot comment on this specific event without further information,\" but added that \"charges with respect to parks-related offences are issued immediately in person.\"\n\nThe Ministry of the Solicitor-General said in an e-mail Monday that specific rules around for physical-distancing guidelines are up to individual municipalities.\n\n\"Local enforcement personnel are encouraged to exercise discretion and use a graduated approach when enforcing provincial emergency orders,\" spokesperson Brent Ross said.\n\nMr. Bryant said one of his main concerns is that people who receive these tickets have no recourse to fight them, given that the provincial offences courts are shut down. He also questions whether bylaw officers - who do not have the same training or oversight as police - are equipped to hand out such hefty fines.\n\n\"[It's] a lot of power for which they're not prepared,\" he said. \"That led me to be concerned that they might go enforcement crazy - and based on what's happening in Ottawa, it appears that that's exactly what's happening.\"","276":"City's date with Pink Super Moon tomorrow | Kolkata News - Times of India Kolkata: Get set for gazing Pink Super Moon on the Kolkata sky around 6.17pm on Wednesday.

In 2019, major fires in Australia, Russia and California burned over 13.5 million hectares of land - an area four times greater than the size of Belgium. Major floods and cyclones displaced over four million people in Bangladesh, India and Iran, while entire townships were laid to waste by storms such as hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas.\n\nThis year, things show no sign of letting up: the Australian fires continue, Greenland ice sheets are expected to lose another 267 billion tonnes of ice and thawing Arctic permafrost is causing positive feedback effects that will intensify climate heating and future impacts.\n\nIn the face of such a global catastrophe, it can seem futile to take any action, individually. Over 36 billion tonnes of CO\u2082 are emitted globally every year, with each of us responsible for a fraction of this (for example, each person in the UK is responsible for around 5.8 tonnes; each person in India 1.8 tonnes). Even if we reduce personal CO\u2082 emissions, there are billions of other people who might not, plus a vast global economic system whose trajectory seems immovable. It seems unlikely that our lone actions and voices can really make a difference.\n\nBut our actions do matter. The global environment is withering from the accumulation of billions of small impacts. Each of our individual purchases or travel choices is a vote for how we treat other people and the natural world, and even if we don't directly see the results, our votes do count.\n\nOur choices ripple across the surface of the globe and accumulate to create seemingly unstoppable tidal waves of destruction. And those big global institutions that seem so powerful are actually just made up from our collective worldviews (past and present). We are not individuals fighting against some kind of faceless system: we are the system that needs to change.\n\nDo individuals exist?\n\nAs I explore in my new book The Self Delusion, scientific evidence from a wide range of disciplines shows that we are not isolated individuals, despite often perceiving ourselves this way.\n\nThere are many ways in which this can be observed. To start with, most of our 37 trillion human cells have such a short lifespan that we are essentially made anew every few months, directed by a genetic code that is a shared heritage not just of humanity but all life on Earth.\n\nOur minds, meanwhile, are deeply influenced by other people - every word, touch, pheromone received from others alters the neural network in your brains, so you cannot really call yourself the same person you were when you woke up this morning. And the new science of social networks shows that we are linked together so closely that ideas, behaviours and preferences flow between us in a way that makes it unclear where one mind ends and another begins.\n\nWhat's more, new research in the field of environmental psychology finds that when we acknowledge this interconnectedness, we care more for others and the natural world. This idea was first speculated by \"deep ecology\" philosophers such as Arne Naess and has now been confirmed through modern quantitative surveys.\n\nWhen people feel more connected to nature according to various metrics, they tend to have greater happiness, autonomy and personal growth, as well as stronger attitudes and behaviours towards protecting the environment. Similarly, when people score highly on metrics assessing social connectedness, they tend to have lower anxiety, greater wellbeing and more empathy.\n\nCollective change\n\nTo gain all these benefits, we need a change of mindset. It is often said that when we are young and optimistic, we strive to change the world around us, but when we are older and wiser, we realise the futility of this and aspire to change ourselves instead.\n\nYet to solve the major environmental problems the world now faces, we actually need to do both - to change the world and ourselves. In fact, it is even more nuanced than that - because changing ourselves is a prerequisite for changing the world. Realising the true nature of our human connectedness actually engenders more ethical and environmentally responsible behaviours.\n\nSo how do we achieve this? Once again, recent scientific research can help by identifying the most effective approaches. Outdoor community activities and environmental education increase both our psychological connectedness to others and the natural world, as do meditation and similar practices. Even computer games and books can be designed to increase empathy. These offer empowering ways to become part of something bigger, to overcome the delusion of individual isolation.\n\nSo although the impact of a lone individual to tackle climate change is negligible, fortunately, you are not just a lone individual - you are part of something much greater. We are deeply connected to one another at both a physical and psychological level, and when that truth is genuinely acknowledged, we act differently, becoming more compassionate and caring for each other and the environment.\n\nOur interconnectedness also means that positive behaviours can cascade to influence many others. When we consider ourselves part of a collective, we can tackle the climate crisis.\n\nClick here to subscribe to our climate action newsletter. Climate change is inevitable.

However, the sole parasite manipulator in the ant brain is presumed not infective to its next host whereas the parasites in the abdomen of the same ant are infective. We conducted a test of genetic relatedness between the brain fluke to those flukes in the abdomen. Our data show that clonemates (i.e. genetically identical individuals) are cotransmitted into ants and that the brain fluke is often a clonemate of flukes in the abdomen. Hence, our study provides empirical evidence that supports a role for kin selection in the evolution of a host-manipulating behavior.\n\nHost manipulation by parasites is a fascinating evolutionary outcome, but adaptive scenarios that often accompany even iconic examples in this popular field of study are speculative. Kin selection has been invoked as a means of explaining the evolution of an altruistic-based, host-manipulating behavior caused by larvae of the lancet fluke Dicrocoelium dendriticum in ants. Specifically, cotransmission of larval clonemates from a snail first host to an ant second host is presumed to lead to a puppeteer parasite in the ant's brain that has clonemates in the ant abdomen. Clonal relatedness between the actor (brain fluke) and recipients (abdomen flukes) enables kin selection of the parasite's host-manipulating trait, which facilitates transmission of the recipients to the final host. However, the hypothesis that asexual reproduction in the snail leads to a high abundance of clonemates in the same ant is untested. Clonal relationships between the manipulator in the brain and the nonmanipulators in the abdomen are also untested. We provide empirical data on the lancet fluke's clonal diversity within its ant host. In stark contrast to other trematodes, which do not exhibit the same host-manipulating behavioral trait, the lancet fluke has a high abundance of clonemates. Moreover, our data support existing theory that indicates that the altruistic behavior can evolve even in the presence of multiple clones within the same ant host. Importantly, our analyses conclusively show clonemate cotransmission into ants, and, as such, we find support for kin selection to drive the evolution and maintenance of this iconic host manipulation.","281":"Close to Birds, a beautiful new book Before photography, illustrations printed in books were a frequent way people brought images of nature into their homes. Often, this was done by cutting the illustration from the book, framing it, and hanging it on the wall.\n\nI understand, but couldn't do that. As much as I love birds I love books even more. Books are to be preserved as much as birds are.\n\nI thought of that when opening a new book, \"Close to Birds: an intimate look at our feathered friends.\" This is a collection of incredible and personal photos of birds, accompanied by informative and conversational text. Roine Magnusson took the photos. Mats and Asa Ottosson wrote the text. The three are Swedish.\n\nIf this book had been published pre-photography, surely some of these pages would be framed somewhere. The photos are works of art, worthy of display. The technique used to take these highly detailed, stylized photos, giving such a unique impression of the birds, is explained in the book.\n\nMagnusson worked with bird banders, borrowing birds for a minute or two to take their pictures. The birds went into an empty box, a stage as it were, with unmarked sides, Magnusson with camera and flash in place, peering into the box. The bird did what it does. Magnusson captured postures and poses, color and detail in a few photos with each subject. The birds, treated with care the author says, were quickly released.\n\nThe birds are from Europe, some species known to us as well. More importantly, the birds are beautiful regardless of species or whereabouts. There are birds of stunning color, birds of the plainest patterns. The Ottossons write of the house sparrow, \"We love to see the magic in the ordinary.\"\n\nThe images are large, sometimes within the bounds of the 8 1\/2 x 9 1\/4-inch pages, sometimes cropped to fit, the birds making that decision by their behavior in front of the camera. Again, the detail in these photos is extraordinary, the colors likewise.\n\nThe book is printed on fine, heavy stock. It is a work of art itself, beautifully bound, with clean and dramatic design, all ingredient choices well made.","282":"Club Book announces fall schedule, with Nora McInerny, Thrity Umrigar and more Yes, fall is in the air, but that's a good thing because that means the fall season of Club Book is about to begin.

Sediments mainly comprise massive and cross-bedded sand and gravels, and rhythmically-bedded clay and silt\/fine sand couplets, interbedded with diamictons that were deposited by a range of mass flows of different viscosities. Although sediment stratigraphy and ice advance-retreat patterns are well established for the Puget Lobe, brittle and ductile deformation structures within, and separating, these sediment units are less well understood. These structures record the nature of ice-bed interactions taking place in subglacial and proglacial environments. This study examines evidence for these processes and environments. Key deformation structures identified include open to overturned folds, normal and reverse faults, clastic dikes and hydrofractures and passive-loading structures. Evidence for coeval development of ductile and brittle deformation structures shows the close relationship between porewater changes, sediment rheology and sediment system responses to changes in strain caused by ice-bed interactions.","284":"Coffee House Press is a finalist for Kirkus Prizes in so many ways Valeria Luiselli, photo by Devin Yalkin, New York Times.\n\nThe finalists for the prestigious Kirkus Prize were announced today, and a memoir published by the Minneapolis publisher Coffee House Press is among the nonfiction finalists. \"When Death Takes Something From You, Give it Back,\" by Naja Marie Aidt, translated by Denise Newman, is also long-listed for a National Book Award.\n\nOther finalists include a memoir by Saeed Jones, who is coming to town in October for Talking Volumes.

More recently, Pentax has announced that it's developing a new FA* 85mm f\/1.4. Although there are certain physical similarities to a Sigma lens, I doubt that it's the same lens.\n\nAt this stage, it's difficult to make any definitive conclusions about what this latest lens from Pentax is or isn't. Most of the specifications have not yet been released. We don't currently know how many optical elements and groups will be contained in this newly announced lens.\n\nHaving said that, Pentax has released enough information for us to have some warranted suspicions. First of all, just look at the lens. I mean, putting it side by side with the Sigma, as I have done in the lead image of this article, you can see some very significant similarities. The bulbous top section of the lens with a slimmer lower section looks very similar to the Sigma 85mm f\/1.4 Art lens, but with a different housing. The comment sections for several sites are discussing this very point too.\n\nIf, however, you go to the Ricoh website, you'll see that they have released some of the major specifications for this upcoming lens. Aside from the physical similarities, which are striking, the paper specs don't fit the theory. Although the minimum focusing distance and the minimum aperture are the same as the Sigma, the remaining specifications are not. The Pentax lens, for example, contains three low dispersion elements, whereas the Sigma only contains two. In my view, this alone makes the Pentax a different lens from the Sigma. Other differences include the filter thread size and the physical dimensions of the lens too.\n\nIf this newly announced lens from Ricoh is in fact a rehoused Sigma lens, I don't think that's a bad thing by any means. First of all, the Sigma 85mm is one of the best on the market. In my experience, it produces brilliant results. Wide open, this lens is able to capture lots of detail, and it's one of the sharpest on the market right now. If Ricoh has rehoused this for their K-mount, maybe that's not a bad thing.\n\nThe Pentax 24-70mm is lighter than the Tamron lens, and even the physical dimensions are different too. Ricoh obviously made some changes to their version, and in my view, improved it. I think a mid-range zoom lens doesn't require stabilization, especially considering the fact that the K1 Mark II already contains IBIS. Therefore, having a lighter full-frame zoom lens is essentially more useful.\n\nIf Ricoh has rehoused the Sigma, my guess is that they've probably improved on this already incredible lens. Based on that, I don't think anyone is going to be overly disappointed if that is the case. Taking a look at the filter threads on both lenses, the Pentax lens tapers on the top, and maybe that slight change allowed the smaller size. That in itself is a very useful change, because filters above 82mm are harder to find and more expensive.\n\nOf course, as of right now, this is merely speculation in the comments sections, and although at first glance, it appears that Ricoh has rehoused the Sigma, I'm not convinced that is the case. I think that this is more than likely an original lens from Ricoh, which Pentax shooters should be very happy about.","287":"Compartmentalized processing of catechols during mussel byssus fabrication determines the destiny of DOPA This article requires a subscription to view the full text. If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nCatechol chemistry has emerged as a cornerstone of bioinspired polymers and adhesives due to its versatility in creating diverse covalent and dynamic noncovalent interactions (including metal coordination). The concept initially arose from the discovery that mussels use catechol moieties of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) to mediate robust surface adhesion in seawater and to reinforce tough and self-healing biopolymer fibers. Currently, difficulties controlling DOPA redox chemistry limit its synthetic application; yet, mussels overcome this challenge daily through apparent physical and chemical process control. Here, we reveal that mussels employ several different processing pathways that predetermine the cross-linking fate of DOPA-containing proteins via spatiotemporal control of microenvironments in secretory vesicles and later in mature threads -- with key significance for advanced polymer design.","288":"Computational design of closely related proteins that adopt two well-defined but structurally divergent folds Computational protein design has focused primarily on the design of sequences which fold to single stable states, but in biology many proteins adopt multiple states. We used de novo protein design to generate very closely related proteins that adopt two very different states -- a short state and a long state, like a viral fusion protein -- and then created a single molecule that can be found in both forms. Our proteins, poised between forms, are a starting point for the design of triggered shape changes.\n\nThe plasticity of naturally occurring protein structures, which can change shape considerably in response to changes in environmental conditions, is critical to biological function. While computational methods have been used for de novo design of proteins that fold to a single state with a deep free-energy minimum [P.-S. Huang, S. E. Boyken, D. Baker, Nature 537, 320-327 (2016)], and to reengineer natural proteins to alter their dynamics [J. A. Davey, A. M. Damry, N. K. Goto, R. A. Chica, Nat. Chem. Biol. 13, 1280-1285 (2017)] or fold [P. A. Alexander, Y. He, Y. Chen, J. Orban, P. N. Bryan, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 106, 21149-21154 (2009)], the de novo design of closely related sequences which adopt well-defined but structurally divergent structures remains an outstanding challenge. We designed closely related sequences (over 94% identity) that can adopt two very different homotrimeric helical bundle conformations -- one short (\u223c66 \u00c5 height) and the other long (\u223c100 \u00c5 height) -- reminiscent of the conformational transition of viral fusion proteins. Crystallographic and NMR spectroscopic characterization shows that both the short- and long-state sequences fold as designed. We sought to design bistable sequences for which both states are accessible, and obtained a single designed protein sequence that populates either the short state or the long state depending on the measurement conditions. The design of sequences which are poised to adopt two very different conformations sets the stage for creating large-scale conformational switches between structurally divergent forms.","289":"Conditional antibody expression to avoid central B cell deletion in humanized HIV-1 vaccine mouse models This article requires a subscription to view the full text. If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nMouse models can provide fast and cost-effective systems to test HIV-1 vaccine candidates at the preclinical stage. To serve this purpose, mouse models are engineered to express the precursors of human broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against diverse HIV-1 strains. Immunization of such mouse models can evaluate the ability of vaccines to mature the precursor antibodies into bnAbs. However, due to the unusual properties of bnAbs, mouse models expressing their precursors often have B cell developmental defects. Herein, we devised and validated a strategy to address this problem. This approach could also facilitate the expression of other clinically relevant antibodies in mature B cells in transgenic mice; immunization of such mice could be used to generate novel antibodies with desirable properties.","290":"Confessions of an Ex-Never Trumper If you want one set of policies, you can't be choosy about character.\n\nShe had to sleep on it. The letter was in her inbox; friends and colleagues, throughout the Republican national-security circles where Rebeccah Heinrichs had made her career, were signing on. It called then-candidate Donald Trump \"fundamentally dishonest\" and claimed that if elected president, he would use his power \"in ways that make America less safe.\" She wasn't crazy about the tone in some spots, but she also didn't think he was a credible candidate. Only a few other Republicans were left in the primary back then in March 2016 -- and she thought a letter like this, with its roll call of GOP luminaries, could help nudge voters to pick someone more responsible.\n\n\"I made the decision based on the information I had,\" she told me recently. She doesn't regret signing the letter, but now thinks that many of the worries she and her colleagues were expressing then -- in warning about Trump's isolationism, the potential economic effects of his trade policies, and his embrace of the \"expansive use of torture,\" among other things -- were unfounded. And she is thrilled about that.\n\nHeinrichs is an exception in the old GOP national-security world -- which for the most part has stuck to its Never Trump positions -- but she's the norm in the party as a whole, which gives Trump a 94 percent approval rating. The 150-odd names on letters such as the one she signed represent the last major bastion of Republican resistance to Trump; prominent members continue to slam the president for his insulting tweets and his volatile temperament, even questioning his very ability to behave like an adult. But outside of this club -- whether for reasons of ambition, genuine approval, or a combination of both -- elected officials and operatives have largely fallen in line behind the president. And Heinrichs, unlike many of her peers, decided she could accept the character flaws because the foreign-policy results looked good.\n\nRead: What Democrats aren't admitting about Trump's record\n\n\"His personal flaws are so transparent that they can distract truly well-meaning people or turn people off altogether,\" she told me. But fundamentally, she feels Trump is fighting for a powerful America. \"I have long argued for American primacy and President Trump is, even if sometimes clumsily, defending it and fighting for it. I'm not going to yell at the clouds over his tweets or obsess over this or that expression of bad manners.\"\n\nTrump has done plenty of things the old Republican foreign-policy establishment would cheer for, if someone else were doing them. He has labeled China as a threat, condemning its trade practices and calling for investments to counter the country's military rise. He ditched a nuclear deal with Iran that many Republicans hated, and has financially devastated the regime instead. His administration has added more troops in Eastern Europe to confront Russia, and ended an arms-control treaty that Moscow was violating -- even while Trump himself has confused matters by praising Vladimir Putin's leadership and questioning whether Russia has really interfered in U.S. elections. Whatever Trump's own doubts, though, at the insistence of Congress, he has imposed sanctions against Russia for 2016 election interference. Sure, he has said mean things about NATO, but Republicans and Democrats alike have long wanted other members to pay more for their own defense, and now they are.\n\nOn the flip side, the Trump presidency hasn't manifested in the precise kind of nightmare the Never Trump letter writers envisioned in 2016. In the first of two alarmed open missives -- one that appeared in March 2016 in War on the Rocks and another in The New York Times that August -- GOP foreign-policy power brokers warned about specific consequences of a Trump presidency: His wish for trade wars was \"a recipe for economic disaster\"; his \"hateful, anti-Muslim rhetoric\" would alienate allies in the Muslim world; he could bring back torture. In 2020, the economic effects of the trade war have been mild, cushioned by a multibillion-dollar bailout to farmers; Muslim allies in the Gulf in particular have overlooked his rhetoric and embraced Trump over his harshness toward their archenemy Iran; the use of torture in war remains illegal, even though Trump has granted clemency to three soldiers accused of war crimes.\n\nNone of this consoles the many signatories who still find Trump unacceptable. Policies can change, but character does not. If your main concern in 2016 was that Trump was \"fundamentally dishonest\" and \"wildly inconsistent,\" or that he \"lacks the temperament to be President,\" as the letters claimed, Trump likely hasn't convinced you otherwise. And even if the worst predictions haven't come to pass, you still won't feel reassured while someone you fundamentally distrust is making life-and-death decisions on behalf of the country every day; there's no World War III now, but in the words of the prominent Never Trumper and Atlantic contributor Eliot Cohen, \"that's a pretty low bar.\" Cohen, a former senior Bush-administration official who helped coordinate the War on the Rocks letter, described the specific kind of unease he felt in Politico in late 2017. \"This is about putting lives on the line. These are enormously consequential kinds of decisions that a president makes. And character really trumps, so to speak, everything else.\"\n\nQuinta Jurecic and Benjamin Wittes: Trump's Playbook Is Terribly Ill-Suited to a Pandemic\n\nOr maybe power does. Far from being inhibited by the foreign-policy establishment that shunned him, Trump has destroyed it. The list of names on the letters now reads like a memorial wall for the party's old power brokers. Trump has barred them almost entirely from jobs in his administration, and built a new pro-Trump establishment on the wreckage of the old GOP elite.\n\nHeinrichs is the rare young intellectual to have lived in both worlds. By 2016, she had worked on missile-defense issues on the Hill and held research posts at a number of conservative think tanks, headlining panels on issues such as \"the future of missile defense\" and co-authoring a paper on \"deterrence and nuclear targeting in the 21st century.\" Now a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, she has been described as \"one of the leaders of the next generation of experts on nuclear strategy and arms control\" and is a regular TV commentator on U.S. foreign policy. She, along with a few other members of the GOP's most resistant segment -- which includes people who have spent their careers devoted to alliances, worrying about presidential character, and banging on about norms and values -- have now come around to Trump's foreign policy.\n\nEven in primary season, Heinrichs saw hints of Trump's appeal. People she knew back home in small-town Ohio found the candidates she was informally advising, including Marco Rubio and Scott Walker, too wooden. \"I have some lifelong Democrat friends and family members who, for the first time in their life, supported the Republican candidate and voted for Donald Trump,\" she said. \"He's like, 'I'm tired of Americans dying in Afghanistan.' And they're like, 'Yeah, so are we.'\"\n\nTrump, of course, made it through the primaries despite the Republican opposition, and Heinrichs knew she couldn't support Clinton, whom she saw as dangerously accommodating to foes such as China and Iran. She had also noticed patterns in what Trump was saying. Just because he wanted to avoid overseas \"nation-building\" didn't make him an isolationist -- he also wanted better trade deals, so clearly wanted to be engaged in the world. So, she said on a Federalist podcast then, \"I was open to this idea of a different kind of commander in chief.\"\n\nThere was something else, she told The Federalist. \"I didn't like the direction that the Never Trump national-security establishment was going.\" The suggestion that Trump would start a nuclear war, or a war with Muslims all over the world was \"incredibly irresponsible coming from people who I think, and know, know better.\"\n\nThis, after all, was the president that the election had delivered, and clearly many of the notions the old GOP foreign-policy establishment considered sacred were very much open to question. \"Ordinary Americans ... look at the establishment and say, 'I don't think you guys necessarily know what you're doing,'\" she told me. Many in the establishment were the same people who had advocated or helped mismanage wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And anyway, was Trump being ignorant or spooking allies when he asked what the point of NATO was and why the U.S. had troops in South Korea? Or was he asking questions that average Americans wanted to know the answers to?\n\nHe could be doing both, but Heinrichs found it offensive that elites she knew considered it unreasonable for Trump -- and by extension the millions of people who voted for him -- to wonder where American resources were going and why. To her, this, and the broader discomfort with Trump's populist appeal, reflected establishment contempt for public opinion. \"I think it's wrong for the professional national-security class to write off common Americans as irrelevant or even nuisances,\" Heinrichs said.\n\nThe matter of Trump himself, however, persists -- and whatever good his administration may be doing in his supporters' eyes, his own words frequently call into doubt where the United States really stands. His Russia comments were one example, and his sudden order to remove troops from northeastern Syria last fall left a vacuum for Russia to fill. He has praised leaders his government formally considers enemies, including North Korea's Kim Jong Un (\"We fell in love,\" Trump once said of the dictator), and even the Taliban's chief (\"The relationship is very good that I have with the mullah\"). These gestures would be unthinkable for any president from the GOP \"establishment\" -- which excoriated the Obama administration for its Taliban talks and for dealing with Iran's \"mullahs.\"\n\nRead: Qassem Soleimani haunted the Arab world\n\nNevertheless, Trump's lack of concern for foreign-policy orthodoxy has also unshackled him in ways Heinrichs has cheered, although she admitted to \"white-knuckling\" over some of the risks Trump embraced. For instance, both George W. Bush and Barack Obama had opportunities to kill the Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, but they decided against it. Yes, Soleimani was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans in Iraq, but Iran and the U.S. were not formally at war, and such a hit could start one. A more typical administration would focus on those risks and hold lots of interagency meetings. \"And it's like, ok, but I would like to kill Soleimani,\" said Heinrichs. \"So is it just talking points and white papers that we're trying to do? It's almost like we were afraid of our own shadow in these policy areas where Donald Trump doesn't care.\"\n\nIf orthodoxy isn't always right, though, neither is flouting it. She was uneasy about Trump's performance at his meeting with Putin in Helsinki, where Trump undermined his intelligence agencies' findings on election interference. \"Across the board, I think for any American president, when you leave your own borders, you take your own side,\" she said. She also admired appointees such as James Mattis, who resigned on principle, and a stream of other ex-officials who condemned Trump on their way out the door. While she chalks up the departures to Trump's comfort with high turnover, she's also not happy with some of his decisions to fire people.\n\nThe rift in the old \"Never Trump\" community has put former allies on opposing sides and destroyed friendships. Heinrichs is baffled by colleagues determined to bash a president who is doing many of the things they used to want, though she says she is cordial with them. Cohen has been harsher, comparing Trump's sympathizers to those who served the Vichy regime in Nazi-occupied France. The former diplomat Robert Blackwill signed both letters, later reservedly praised Trump's foreign policies, and still said he would support any of the Democratic candidates over Trump in 2020. Once again, the policies didn't matter so much as the man himself. \"One can correct mistakes in foreign policy, or at least often one can,\" Blackwill said. But Trump is \"weakening our democratic institutions, and he's dividing the country. So in my judgment, that has much longer implications than any particular foreign policy that he pursues.\"\n\nBut even if he loses in 2020, Trump is not going away. \"There are too many people inside D.C. who think Donald Trump is a fluke and that the only reason he won was because his opponent was so weak,\" Heinrichs said. And their additional warnings about Trump's alleged damage to American standing in the world, his treatment of the federal bureaucracy, and his violations of long-standing norms, have clearly failed to convince the 40-odd percent of the country that approves of him.\n\nIt's still hard to say whether, in the event of a Trump reelection, more signatories will tire of being locked out of the new center of GOP power, and let go of their character concerns.\n\n\"If I had my way, I would love to have a president who can lift the country and unify it, and has great personal virtue, and [can] carry out all of these policies that I think are necessary to defend and strengthen our security,\" Heinrichs said.

They are validated and sustained by the aegis of blacks that prostitute skin color for personal economic enrichment. What they view as equipoise has had disparate impact upon blacks, not least of which being generational inferiority.\n\nSERC boasts itself as the: \"Recognized statewide leader in supporting educators, districts, and others in addressing the challenges that contribute to Connecticut's racial opportunity gaps. They propose a blueprint for racial equality in education that focuses on five critical elements: Leadership, Professional Capacity, School Climate, Schools-Family-Community Partnerships, and Teaching & Learning.\" (ctserc.org)\n\nThis Erebusic plan to portray history for black children through a crayon-colored prism will simply continue the institutionalized narrative of \"white people bad\" and blacks victims. Regardless of what the public is told, neo-Leninist teachers claiming America stole the Southwest and California from Mexico and that President Trump is separating illegal aliens - who have violated U.S. sovereignty by illegally entering the country - from their children, will brainwash the Latino component.\n\nAccording to the official 2017 estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, Waterbury is 61.12 percent white, 20.94 percent black, and allowing that the designation \"other\" race references Hispanics, they are 10.46 percent of the population.\n\nTRENDING: Sheriff rebels against governor: 'We will not be setting up a police state'\n\nEducational attainment by those they identify as \"race\" shows: 87.91% of white students graduate high school with 22.23% obtaining bachelor's degrees; 84.08% of black students graduate with 8.07% obtaining bachelor's degrees; and 65.85% of Hispanic students graduate high school with 8.07% obtaining a bachelor's degree.\n\nA trained eye immediately notes the number of graduates versus the number of students who go on to obtain bachelor's degrees. The disparity between those numbers indicates that the majority of students didn't graduate on merit; rather they were promoted to the next grade based upon social standards juxtaposed to achievement standards.\n\nOnly 13% of black students were able to read at grade level, according to the data available for 2017\/2018, with only 25% of Hispanic students reading at grade level.\n\nThe numbers for this same period become more abysmal when we note: 33.35% of Hispanics and 26.39% of blacks, compared to only 13.18% of whites, are in poverty. And before the denier class liberals and skin-color pimps blame the disparate numbers on the population numbers; according to available statistics during this period, whites outnumbered Hispanics by approximately 700, and while whites outnumbered blacks in Waterbury by 17,800, the difference in population numbers stems from the high rate of black abortions Connecticut boasts.\n\nThe primary causal factor for families living in poverty and specifically blacks is the composition of the home. Data on married households in Waterbury show: whites 39.7%, Hispanics 28.7%, and blacks 27.1%. Never-married whites are 35.2%, Hispanics are 50.9%, and blacks are 54.4%.\n\nThese numbers do not lie. They are taken directly from the official 2017 estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau Waterbury, Connecticut, itself used.\n\nReasonable minds will conclude that Lyndon Johnson's (that's President Lyndon Johnson for those in public school) 1964\/1965 Great Society Programs and his 1964 War on Poverty programs have failed; in reality they've succeeded beyond anything he could have anticipated.\n\n\"At the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964, 87 percent of black households were married two-parent homes and 40 percent of blacks were business owners. Today black women are singularly responsible for killing off over one-third of the entire black populace by the industrialization of baby killing.\" (See: \"Transcript: Jim Simpson of Accuracy In Media Interviews Mychal Massie,\" mychal-massie.com.)\n\nSERC is taking another step toward the complete homogenization of public schools by Fabian Democratic Socialists. Their objective is to control every facet of education. They already own the public school system; they are now focused upon ending homeschooling in its current incarnation. They're committed to forcing private Christian schools to conform to their standards, by the codification of legislative edicts, and transform into government-run institutions of access failure. (See: \"Stalin Knew, Mao Knew, Hitler Definitely Knew,\" mychal-massie.com, Dec. 27, 2012.)\n\nThese calumniators are committed to creating a nation of Alinskyites.\n\nWe must learn to listen and properly evaluate what is being said when these socialists speak. It's imperative that those who truly care and who are truly concerned for the educational well-being of their children recognize what is being represented when Waterbury lists statistical data as two and three generations.\n\nDepending upon statistical intent, a generation can be anywhere from 30 years to 50 years or longer today. Using 30 years as the minimum would mean that Waterbury has been working quietly to imprison families on the plantation of government subsistence in some instances for 90 years.\n\nSERC isn't doing children any good. They're entrenching and indemnifying themselves against failure by using the same model Vladimir Lenin and W.E.B. Du Bois used, and that Margaret Sanger institutionalized. They're getting blacks that are willing to betray their so-called people for perceived gain.\n\nHaven't you wondered how it is that a plexus of infidels like white liberals are so bitterly opposed to anything that's factually good for families and specifically black families, e.g., school vouchers, pro-life policy, tax cuts, etc.? Haven't you wondered why people like Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, the Obamas, Spike Lee et al. are so opposed to real education, moral excellence and the extrication of the soul and mind from the neo-Leninist plantation?","292":"Consultant- ART initiative project support (must be eligible to work in EU) - Brussels The ART Initiative - Hub for Territorial Partnerships is a UNDP's global project that is geared at harnessing the potential of territorial partnerships through a variety of modalities, such as Decentralized Cooperation, South-South and triangular cooperation. ART is therefore an entry point for international cooperation actors interested in harmonizing their respective actions in support of national and sub-national policies for sustainable and local human development. ART aims at strengthening and expanding the existing alliance between UNDP and Decentralized Cooperation partners in support of the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at local level. ART also seeks to strengthen the potential and role of Local and Regional Governments (LRGs) as development partners and to promote the principles of development cooperation effectiveness and in support of the localization of the SDGs.\n\nIn this global panorama marked by common challenges that require partnerships and innovative and complex solutions to achieve sustainable development \"without leaving no one behind\", UNDP ART has partnered with many decentralized cooperation partners to jointly promote innovative initiatives that contribute to the localization of the 2030 Agenda. Therefore, over the years, the initiative has contributed to demonstrate that regional, municipal and local authorities, together with other local governance stakeholders, have a key role to play in promoting sustainable development and making the SDGs part of national and local development strategies and policies.\n\nIn this context, recently launched initiative supported by the Government of Extremadura, through its International Development Cooperation Agency (AEXCID), aims to implement the SDGs in its own territory as well as others connecting knowledge and experiences for SDG localization. The AEXCID-UNDP alliance will contribute to jointly promote a global multi-stakeholder and multi-level dialogue, encouraging the development of territories of peace and coexistence within the framework of the localization of the SDGs.\n\nIn this context, the initiative would like to hire a consultant that shall support the implementation of this project. With a first-hand knowledge of the context of the Extremadura region and its institutions, he\/she must have a good sense of self-organization and flexibility. The individual must be self-motivated, with the capacity to take initiatives. With good communications skills, he\/she should be able to work effectively under pressure and meet tight deadlines. The incumbent is expected to work in close collaboration with all members of the ART team.","293":"Consumers wanting more lenient return policies are often getting them Kathleen Segan of Minneapolis doesn't blame Bed Bath & Beyond for paying out only 80 percent when a customer returns an item without a receipt.\n\n\"How are they supposed to distinguish between a regular return and one that was shoplifted?\" she asked.\n\nSegan said she appreciates the company's liberal return policy and its store coupons. So the recent change by Bed, Bath & Beyond to deduct one-fifth of the purchase price from a return without a receipt won't affect her. Besides, she keeps her receipts.\n\nGenerous return policies draw customers to stores like Costco, Macy's, J.C. Penney, Nordstrom, Kohl's, L.L. Bean, Lands' End and Bed Bath & Beyond. But those retailers face trade-offs.\n\n\"Returns continue to be a pain point for consumers and retailers,\" said Tom Caporaso, CEO of Clarus Marketing Group. \"Without a good return policy, consumers take their business elsewhere.\"\n\nBed Bath & Beyond isn't saying why it changed its policy, but I'll wager a guess. The 20-percent-off coupons it seems to mail out monthly are so common that I rarely see a customer not using one.\n\nBed Bath & Beyond made returns so easy that some customers probably found a way to make a 20 percent return on their money by using a coupon on the original purchase and then getting full merchandise credit.\n\nReturn fraud cost U.S. retailers $10.9 billion last year, according to the National Retail Federation. During the holidays, retailers estimate 5 percent of returns are fraudulent. At the Better Business Bureau of Minnesota and North Dakota, about 35 percent of complaints involve return policies.\n\nI'm surprised that it took Bed Bath & Beyond so long to make the change and believe it is to be commended for its still-generous policy. The only consumer who will experience inconvenience is the person who paid cash for a purchase. Purchases made with a credit or debit card or check can be tracked for a year there and at most retailers.\n\nIf you think this is a trend toward stricter return policies, it's not. In fact, with many online competitors now offering free return shipping, stores' return policies may get more lenient to remain competitive, said Marshal Cohen, a retail analyst at the NPD Group in New York.\n\nIn March, Target extended the return policy on 32 of its private-label brands to one year instead of 90 days. \"A top complaint of our guest has been the return policy,\" said Dustee Jenkins, vice president of communications at Target. Chief Executive Brian Cornell changed it because of his focus on the customer, she said.\n\nCohen believes other retailers will follow Target with longer return windows. \"You'll see more retailers carrying that forward,\" he said. On the other hand, Bed, Bath & Beyond is an example of a retailer pulling back slightly on a too lenient policy.\n\nElectronics retailer Best Buy in 2013 shortened its return policy on all items to 15 days for most customers and 30 to 45 days for members of its Elite loyalty program. The 15-day window chafes a lot of consumers, but because technology changes so quickly, electronics items tend to lose value rapidly. Best Buy had to adopt a buy-and-stick policy or risk losing too much money, Cohen said.\n\nOther retailers aren't matching Best Buy's 15-day policy because they're more diversified into non-electronic products. Sears, Target, Wal-Mart, Costco and Office Depot generally give 30 to 90 days. Although they may be tempted to shorten that, 30 or 90 days can give them a slight competitive advantage over Best Buy.\n\nYou may disagree, but these are good times for consumers in many ways. Store pickup, free delivery, price-comparison apps and price matching are all putting shoppers in the driver's seat as never before. The Better Business Bureau of Minnesota believes that price matching may be the reason they've seen a decrease in complaints about return policies.\n\nRetailers are not required to take back merchandise. A retailer can choose to make all sales final, or offer merchandise credit only, as long as the policy is clearly stated. According to the Better Business Bureau, the policy must be made available to consumers in \"a clear, conspicuous and transparent way, as a best practice.\"\n\nSome of us used to buy an item at one store and then return it when we discovered it was cheaper at a competitor. Now we just ask for a price match, assuming that we jump through enough hoops to show a lower price from a competitor's current ad on the exact same item. It's a pain, but that's another column.","294":"Contest: Snag a copy of Bright Memory because it looks super dope In today's contest we're giving away copies of slick FPS Bright Memory!\n\nEver now and again a game comes along where even I, a jaded old dork stuck in his ways, can't help but step back and say, \"Damn.\" Bright Memory is one of those times.

The present study shows that the activation of dopamine neurons failed to induce eating. Rather, food approach and eating were observed via activation of LH fibers that project through the VTA, continuing caudally and terminating in a brainstem region medial to the locus coeruleus (LC). We found that activation of GABA neurons in this peri-LC region is both necessary and sufficient for LH stimulation-induced eating, whereas their role in normal homeostatic feeding appears negligible. These findings suggest that this circuit orchestrates just one of the multiple aspects of eating: a compulsive consumption of food in the absence of a physiological stimulus of hunger.\n\nElectrical or optogenetic stimulation of lateral hypothalamic (LH) GABA neurons induces rapid vigorous eating in sated animals. The dopamine system has been implicated in the regulation of feeding. Previous work has suggested that a subset of LH GABA neurons projects to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and targets GABA neurons, inhibiting them and thereby disinhibiting dopaminergic activity and release. Furthermore, stimulation-induced eating is attenuated by dopamine lesions or receptor antagonists. Here we explored the involvement of dopamine in LH stimulation-induced eating. LH stimulation caused sated mice to pick up pellets of standard chow with latencies that varied based on stimulation intensity; once food was picked up, animals ate for the remainder of the 60-s stimulation period. However, lesion of VTA GABA neurons failed to disrupt this effect. Moreover, direct stimulation of VTA or substantia nigra dopamine cell bodies failed to induce food approach or eating. Looking further, we found that some LH GABA fibers pass through the VTA to more caudal sites, where they synapse onto neurons near the locus coeruleus (LC). Similar eating was induced by stimulation of LH GABA terminals or GABA cell bodies in this peri-LC region. Lesion of peri-LC GABA neurons blocked LH stimulation-induced eating, establishing them as a critical downstream circuit element for LH neurons. Surprisingly, lesions did not alter body weight, suggesting that this system is not involved in the hunger or satiety mechanisms that govern normal feeding. Thus, we present a characterization of brain circuitry that may promote overeating and contribute to obesity.","296":"Cooking Mama Fiasco Allegedly Removed as Result of Legal Battle With new voices speaking up over the Cooking Mama: Cookstar controversy that sparked up over the weekend, an anonymous developer of the game has spoken up, and revealed that the mess has supposedly been caused by a legal dispute between publisher Planet Entertainment and IP holder Office Create that is being kept mum. [Thanks, Screen Rant!]\n\nFirst, as previously clarified, the game indeed does not contain a bitcoin miner. The marketing about the game using blockchains were apparently just \"buzzwords\" that were meant to help win over investors. Rather, the overheating of Nintendo Switches that caused suspicion is being caused by issues due to the game being developed in Unity, as many of the staff working on this as their first game product. The anonymous employee added that things like cryptocurrency miners wouldn't have gotten by Nintendo and Sony's rigorous checks.\n\nBut what about the disappearance of the game and all mentions of the game? According to the informant, this is the result of legal battle between publisher Planet Entertainment and IP holder Office Create. The latter wanted the game to stay in development longer, but Planet ended up releasing the game anyways. As such, Office Create took drastic measures to take down the game from the eShop. Even advertising on Youtube, sites, and TikTok was blocked, which is why the game had such a quiet \"launch.\"\n\nWith Planet Entertainment currently seemingly suing Office Create for lost money, the developer concludes that it's unsure whether Cooking Mama: Cookstar will see the light of day again.\n\nCooking Mama: Cookstar was previously available for a brief period on Nintendo Switch.","297":"Coordination of mRNA and tRNA methylations by TRMT10A This article requires a subscription to view the full text.

Dysregulation of such RNA modifications is involved in the development of a battery of human disorders. Studies to date have focused solely on individual modifications on isolated RNA; however, RNA modifications exist concurrently in multiple RNA species. Using biochemistry and high-throughput sequencing techniques, we revealed an interaction between a transfer RNA methyltransferase TRMT10A and a messenger RNA demethylase FTO, which influences the methylation levels on a subset of messenger RNAs.

Only the players, match officials, officials from the host association and media are allowed,\" BCCI general manager Saba Karim, who is in charge of domestic cricket, told PTI. The decision came after the Sports Ministry's advisory to all NSFs to follow the Health Ministry's advisory and avoid large gatherings in sports events. The government's directive is unlikely to have a huge impact on the final day's proceedings with only a handful of spectators coming to watch the action on the previous four days.\n\nBengal are aiming for their first title since 1989-90 while Saurashtra are eying their maiden trophy.\n\nAfter a drab three days, Thursday witnessed absorbing action with both teams fighting to take the first innings lead, which will effectively decide the Ranji Trophy winner.\n\nBengal, who have four wickets in hand, need 72 runs to overcome Saurashtra's 425 for the all-important first innings lead.\n\nThe decision to not allow fans to watch day five of Ranji Trophy final comes after a host of sporting events have been cancelled around the world or are being conducted in empty stadiums to tackle the Coronavirus threat.\n\nItaly, the worst-hit country in Europe, has cancelled all sporting events at least till April 3.\n\nThe National Basketball Association (NBA) in the United States has suspended the ongoing season after one of its players tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nIn India, the national cricket team's home ODIs against South Africa in Lucknow and Kolkata are likely to be played behind closed doors after the series opener was washed out in Dharamsala on Thursday.\n\nForeign players due to take part in the IPL beginning March 29 will be unavailable at least till April 15 due to government-imposed visa restrictions.\n\nThe Indian Open golf, scheduled to run from March 19-22, has been postponed.

Marketwatch.com has reported that video calling app, Zoom, has added more active users so far this year than it did over the whole of 2019. More than ever before, our homes are on display to our colleagues and clients, so keeping your video call backdrop looking professional is a must.\n\nAs much as our homes have become our temporary offices, we need to make sure that they not only look great on a Zoom call, but that they still feel like home at the end of the day. So, here are some updates you can make to your home office space that will up your video call game and give your home an uplifting refresh.\n\nWallpaper\n\nHanging a striking wallpaper will give your conference calls an eye-catching backdrop that will always look more appealing than a plain white wall. Pattern and colour in the form of maximalism have taken centre stage in the interior design world and will continue to look fresh into 2020 and beyond. A great option is Matthew Williamson X Osborne & Little's new collection, Daydreams, which comprises seven wild and wonderful digitally printed wallpapers, \"inspired by childlike daydreams and reminiscing over a Californian road trip\".\n\nAnother place to pick up some breathtaking wallpapers is Andrew Martin, a globally-inspired homewares brand. It has just launched a collection of mural style wallpapers, Scholar, from which you can choose to surround yourself with larger-than-life pages from the greatest works of literature or huge maps spanning the length of your living room wall.\n\nArt\n\nContinuing the focus on the walls which will be visible on your video calls, hanging art is another great way to add interest to your background. If you're currently renting your home-come-office, use command strips to hang your art to ensure you keep your landlord sweet.\n\nShop far and wide to find art that you love, and don't limit yourself to a certain style or medium. There are some incredible vintage prints and film posters on Vinterior, an online marketplace for vintage and antique homeware, and Partnership Editions offers a beautifully curated selection of artworks to help you on your way to starting your collection. The Affordable Art Fair took place earlier this month, but its online offering is shoppable, providing one of the best sources of art from a wide and varied list of artists.\n\nShelves\n\nThe most important part of a home office is ample storage for files, books and physical references. The trend for open shelving has skyrocketed over the last few years, with the \"shelfie\" becoming the interior design equivalent of the Kardashian-propagated act of self-photography, so ensure your shelves look the best they can, not only for yourself but for your employer too.\n\nThere are lots of contemporary shelving options to create these useful focal points on your walls. The Umbra Cubist Wallshelf, available on Amara, even includes an integrated mini-shelf for a pot plant, while the Frama Shelf Library, designed by Kim Richardt, a Danish designer, available from Nest, is inspired by the original Scandinavian post-war shelving designs.\n\nPeter Erlandsson, co-owner of String Furniture, a Swedish shelving company founded in 1949, suggests, \"Styling objects on a simple shelf can be beautiful and decorative. Treat your shelf like a canvas, and create a work of art on top of it with the belongings you need frequent, instant access to. Not only is it fun to create your own, organic and changing artwork from your own knick-knacks, but it is a great way to save space. When you lift things off the floor and use shelving as a storage solution, you create the illusion of a larger space.\"\n\nSo, let's get excited to answer that video call, be proud of our homes and the hard work we are putting into making this digital way of living into the new normal.","310":"Correction for Jamieson et al., Signaling the trustworthiness of science PERSPECTIVE Correction for \"Signaling the trustworthiness of science,\" by Kathleen Hall Jamieson, Marcia McNutt, Veronique Kiermer, and Richard Sever, which was first published September 23, 2019; 10.1073\/pnas.1913039116 (Proc.

The freebies will be sent only if the new member agrees to sign up for auto renew.\n\nCostco doesn't run as many Groupon promotions as Sam's Club, probably because Costco's revenues are nearly double Sam's with only slightly more square footage. Last year Sam's Club announced it was closing 63 stores, including the one in St. Louis Park.

The U.S. government claims that Philip Morris and eight other cigarette manufacturers conspired to hide the health consequences and addictiveness of cigarettes. Friday's ruling by the court came in the fifth appeal to be filed since the case was brought.\n\nIn its decision, the three-judge panel said the lower court overstepped its authority by requiring tobacco makers to include a statement saying a U.S. court found that they deliberately deceived the public about the health effects of secondhand smoke.\n\nThe statement reveals \"nothing about cigarettes\" and focuses instead on the companies' conduct, the court ruled.\n\nSpokesmen for Altria Group Inc., Reynolds American Inc. and Lorillard Inc. didn't immediately return calls seeking comment on the ruling. Philip Morris USA is a unit of Altria.\n\nA court's finding in 2006 that the companies joined together to boost profits through false statements eventually led to an order requiring corrective disclosures on package labels.\n\nThe racketeering case followed a 1998 agreement between 46 states and the five biggest tobacco companies that set standards for how they market and sell their products. Those restrictions, along with higher taxes and aggressive anti-smoking campaigns, spurred years of declining sales volumes as more people quit.\n\nIn recent years, manufacturers have been able to raise prices, leading to modest revenue gains. Reynolds and Lorillard have pushed away from discount cigarettes to focus on more profitable brands, including Camel and Newport. Sales volume declines have slowed, helped most recently by low gas prices that leave cash in smokers' pockets.\n\nThe companies have sought to combat declining smoking rates and boost profitability by consolidating. Reynolds announced its $25 billion acquisition of Lorillard last July, a deal that will combine the nation's second- and third-largest cigarette makers.","316":"Cracking $6m Anglesea view up for grabs A KNOCKOUT $6 million view is on track to make an Anglesea property with Point Roadknight frontage the most expensive to ever sell in the town.\n\nThe 1858sqm front row plot with panoramic ocean vistas has just hit the market with price hopes of $5.5 million to $6 million.\n\nGreat Ocean Road Real Estate, Anglesea agent Kellie Saddington said the sale of 72 Melba Pde was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to secure one of the holiday town's premium positions.\n\nRELATED: Gerard Healy lists 'one of the best in Jan Juc'\n\nBuyers snap up two houses in premium Geelong street\n\nCOV-19 real estate questions answered\n\nShe said the large block, which comes with two adjoining houses, had the potential to be subdivided into two individual lots.\n\n\"The site is unbelievable just because it can easily be subdivided right down the middle, not a battle-axe, which is so rare,\" Ms Saddington said.\n\n\"Both would have exactly the same view.\n\n\"To have that land size in Anglesea and Point Roadknight frontage is unheard of which is why it has this price.\n\n\"Essentially anything that has been front row with those sort of views has been in the $3 million range.\"\n\nThe main house on the property captures uninterrupted views of the beach through to Point Addis from the open-plan living area and balcony upstairs.\n\nMs Saddington said it was in \"fantastic condition\" and offered two living zones, two bedrooms and two bathrooms.\n\nThe second 1950s house was a single level dwelling with four bedrooms and a private entrance and deck.\n\nShe said with a minimum block size of 800sqm in the Point Roadknight area, the property was large enough to lend itself to a future subdivision.\n\nMany of Anglesea's most expensive sales have been recorded in Melba Pde, including No. 48, which sold for $3.11 million in 2017 and No. 68, which sold for $3.1 million in 2018, according to CoreLogic.\n\nThe new listing offers significantly more land than either of those.","317":"Cramer's lightning round: 'I don't want to own any insurance here' New Residential: \"We do not even need to tinker with a company that cut their dividend.\"\n\nQuest Diagnostics: \"Nice bounce back today but it was a devastating piece that was in Atlantic magazine talking about how they didn't do the job on the test.

The third option is increase of double headers (played on weekdays),\" the source informed.\n\nThe fourth option is holding all matches in just a couple of centres with restricted movements of players, support staff and TV crew.\n\nAnother option is to play behind closed doors and have all the 60 games in a shorter time frame which will ensure that the stakeholders do not lose out truckloads of money.\n\nThe source also confirmed that shifting the tournament abroad was not discussed at all in the meeting.\n\nCOVID-19 has resulted in more than 5,000 deaths globally.\n\nWadia said: \"BCCI, IPL and (official broadcaster) Star (Sports) are clear that we are not looking at financial loss.\"\n\n\"At the meeting everyone agreed that human beings come first and finance comes second.

Meanwhile, Terrence Ross had the quarter Wolves fans were hoping Russell might have, when he went off for 19 of his 33 points.\n\nRussell said the Magic were blitzing him during the fourth, while coach Ryan Saunders said Orlando wasn't helping off Russell, making it hard for him to get the ball.\n\n\"They started out blitzing,\" Saunders said. \"And the way I saw, I'll have to watch the film, I thought they were spying him where they basically were almost playing one defender pretty tight to him, negating some of his help responsibilities I guess to try and keep the ball out of his hands.\"\n\nMiami tried to do the same thing to Russell, and Saunders deployed a dual point guard lineup with Jordan McLaughlin to combat that. It resulted in a win. The Wolves tried the same Friday, and though Russell didn't score, the Wolves did have 29 points for the quarter. They just allowed 33 to Orlando.\n\n\"We made plays.

Here it is in its entirety:\n\n\"We already know they are big, they got guys that can crash the boards. We play with three big men and [James Johnson] and me are not like 5s. We miss Karl-Anthony Towns there, but that's no excuse. Forget the rebounds, just box your man out. They got too many second-chance points.\n\n\"When you're guarding for a long time, that really hurts. When we play good defense, 18-20 seconds of good defense and they shoot a bad shot, that's good defense, and then they got a putback for easy points.\n\nWe are building. We have to keep trusting each other. Get together tomorrow, watch the film and get better. That's the only key.\n\nYou cannot build a castle in one day. It's going to take time.

This comes after Russell said sat out Sunday's loss to Denver as part of what the Wolves called \"planned rest.\"\n\nRussell has had a variety of injuries this season and the Wolves' performance staff in the front office doesn't want to put Russell at risk of further injury. To do so, they want to manage his workload going forward and not overtax him, especially as the Wolves enter the busiest part of their schedule.\n\nHow does Russell feel about it? After the game, it sounded as if he was on board.\n\n\"Going into the summer healthy is a major advantage,\" Russell said. \"For players in our league not having to do rehab, you can gain the edge and work on things you knew you need to work on during the season but you didn't get the time to. I agree with it.

Saunders sympathized with Reid, who took the performance hard.\n\n\"We believe in Naz,\" Saunders said. \"We want to make sure that's known -- that Naz is going to be a very good player because Naz cares.

The Peace-Athabasca Delta is North America's largest inland delta, within a World Heritage area, and is currently threatened by human development. Using multispecies occupancy models we show that the wetland macroinvertebrate community is highly diverse, and spatial and temporal turnover are so high that composition is nearly random, emphasizing stochastic processes of assembly. Using DNA metabarcoding, our study detected more taxa, both overall and per sample, than traditional morphology-based sample processing, increasing our power to detect ecosystem change. Improving data quality and quantifying error are key to delivering effective monitoring and understanding the dynamic structure of the metacommunity.","326":"DNC Chair reassures Jewish Democrats that party will support 2-state solution WASHINGTON (JTA) -- Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. reassured Jewish Democrats that they would be happy with the next party platform.\n\n\"We want to make sure that our platform, which is our values statement of our party, is a platform that you can be proud of, a platform that, again, reaffirms our commitment to a two-state solution -- negotiated directly by the parties,\" Perez told Jewish Democratic leaders in a call last week, according to Jewish Insider.\n\nWhy it matters: Platforms are drafted ahead of national conventions in presidential election years, and ahead of the last two elections, the DNC platform has been beset by controversy.\n\nIn 2012, the draft committee neglected to include recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and it was inserted at the last minute at a raucous public meeting over loud protests.\n\nIn 2016, the DNC opened its foreign policy drafting to the public, and there were tense exchanges over whether to mention Israel's occupation of the West Bank and its blockade of the Gaza Strip. There was no criticism of the occupation in the final version.\n\nThe Republican Party platform also changed from 2012 to 2016. The most recent version omits overt support for a two-state solution and mentions Israel only in describing Jerusalem as a then-future capital. (President Donald Trump in 2017 recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital. Congress did the same in 1995.)\n\nThe Trump factor: Trump has equivocated on endorsing a two-state outcome, and Democrats have sharply criticized his peace plan, released earlier this year, for imposing outcomes on the two sides.","327":"Daily Horoscope: 07 April 2020 Today, for some zodiac signs their unfinished work will be finished and luck will favour them today, but for others, there will be challenges and hardships.

Many who at first saw reducing 911 calls as the goal now believe that \"what's most important is that we have an effective response and that we're meeting people where the needs are,\" Schug said.\n\nSome people dial 911 for help with a crisis -- maybe resolving a fight with a roommate -- or something that feels like a crisis to them. During bouts of anxiety or depression, they report wrestling with suicidal thoughts. They share paranoia symptoms, such as fears that they're being poisoned. Some callers request a welfare check on a grieving friend, or want to describe a neighbor's odd behavior. West St. Paul Police Chief Brian Sturgeon said he's seen a \"dramatic increase\" in such calls over the past six to eight years, echoing statewide reports.\n\nResults hard to measure\n\nFor the pilot program, South St. Paul and West St. Paul each dedicated an officer to the program, and the county funded a social worker at a cost of $80,000 to $90,000 to split time between the two departments. Hastings participated on a smaller scale.\n\nA social worker and police officer visited the homes of 619 callers last year in West St. Paul or South St. Paul right after they got a report of a psychological emergency. They introduced themselves, checked on the person's well-being and offered resources ranging from food shelves to therapists. They also found out whether the person was already getting county assistance.\n\nThe key was to build trust, said Kalyn Bassett, the Dakota County social worker assigned to the initiative. \"It's a program that people aren't expecting,\" she said. \"It's been really well-received.\"\n\nFor a period after that initial follow-up, many of the troubled people called 911, the officer or Bassett more frequently, largely because a relationship was built.\n\nResults can be hard to measure, Bassett said. A visit might keep a person out of the hospital or jail, but that doesn't show up on paper. And even proactive police interactions count as a call. \"A lot of times what [the county] is wanting to know is, how is this pilot benefiting Dakota County financially?\" she said. \"That's something that is elusive and challenging.\"\n\nMore calls, contact\n\nThe outreach process begins when Bassett or the assigned police officers -- Jesse Mettner in West St. Paul or Derek Kruse in South St. Paul -- receives a report about a mental health-related 911 call.\n\nBassett checks the database to see if the person is connected to county services, something police can't do because of privacy laws. Then she and the officer visit their home, asking what kind of support they need or finding ways to boost the care they're getting already.\n\nThe program also ensures that emergency dispatch staffers answering phones after hours have information about frequent callers and a plan for their crises.\n\nEach month, officials with the county, both cities and several organizations meet to discuss trends and brainstorm ways to help certain people.\n\nIn one case, a client was repeatedly exposing themselves and creating a public nuisance. Once Bassett and an officer contacted the person, there were six more calls over six months. But after they recommended changes in the person's home and designed a new plan for addressing the behavior, the calls stopped and a court hearing was averted.\n\nIn another instance, a woman with a history of paranoia had been sent to the hospital but released when she didn't meet hospitalization criteria. Police logged many 911 calls from or about her, because her delusions caused her to act out -- she thought the bank was stealing from her and she threatened tellers, for instance. Bassett created a bond with the woman, who was finally admitted to the hospital after Bassett's long-term documentation showed she couldn't care for herself.\n\nBassett and officers followed up with 25 to 30 callers each month, though some were repeats. The program didn't track the number of 911 calls per participant before and after contact with Bassett and police, but the next phase will collect more complete data at the request of the County Board.\n\nChief Sturgeon noted that the South Metro Fire Department, which provides firefighting and emergency medical services to South St. Paul and West St. Paul, had to respond to fewer calls in 2019 than the year before. Calls related to psychological concerns fell from 566 to 481, a 15% reduction, Sturgeon said.\n\nAssigning an officer to the effort is a hefty commitment for a small department, Sturgeon said. Even so, Apple Valley Police Capt. Nick Francis said his department \"jumped at the chance\" to participate in the next phase of the pilot program. \"We see this coordinated response as the gold standard for police response to persons in crisis,\" he said.","329":"Dancers recall Prince as a hard-working 'darling' in tights and ballet slippers The Twin Cities dance community recalls another side of the artist who first took ballet lessons as a kid.\n\nPrince not only found his voice in Minneapolis, but also his moves.\n\nIn the days after his death, the stories keep coming about how Prince honed his craft and encouraged potential in others, urging prot\u00e9g\u00e9s to dance like it's a higher calling. He certainly set a great example, drawing upon a range of influences, including singer\/dancer extraordinaire James Brown, to create his own sort of funky grace.\n\nPrince's excellence inspired others. Jessica Cressey, a dancer drawn to Minneapolis because of her idol, recounted a conversation in which choreographer Morgan Thorson asked her, \"What motivates you through hard shows?\" Cressey replied, \"I have to set the stakes really high. What if Prince shows up?\"\n\nIt was an unwritten rule that everyone danced on Prince's stage, from the band members to the unparalleled Cat Glover (\"Sign o' the Times\") and Misty Copeland, the first black woman promoted to principal at American Ballet Theatre. Prince's first wife, Mayte Garcia, was a dynamo who reflected every rhythm in her body. He seemed to appreciate anyone who could get in a groove with him -- and keep up.\n\nWhile growing up, Prince had ballet training through an initiative called the Urban Arts Program. It connected students \"who didn't fit into the traditional academic world\" with local arts institutions, explained Minnesota Dance Theatre (MDT) artistic director Lise Houlton.\n\nPrince took classes with MDT in Dinkytown. Houlton's mother, company founder Loyce Houlton, became a mentor and close friend.\n\n\"He was very good to her,\" said Lise. \"He would bring her out to Los Angeles for film premieres. They shared stories and dance information. He would bring people who influenced him to the sound checks of his performances, which were even more interesting than the shows. He really used everything he experienced in those dance classes.\"\n\nShe continued with a catch in her voice, \"It makes me so proud of my mother.\"\n\nPrep for 'Purple Rain'\n\nPrince's loyalty to Loyce continued as his star rose. He headlined a benefit concert for MDT at First Avenue in 1983 that rang up $23,000 for the company's coffers. The evening included choreography by Loyce to \"D.M.S.R.\" while Prince made history with the first live performance of his anthem \"Purple Rain.\"\n\nDuring this period Prince used the MDT studios at Hennepin Center for the Arts to rehearse for his film debut. John Command, an actor and choreographer with a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 stretching from Hollywood to the Chanhassen Dinner Theatres, was teaching jazz dance at MDT when Loyce called with a unique offer.\n\n\"She told me there's a rock band that wants to take dance classes,\" Command said. \"They were willing to pay $150 an hour for four hours a week. They would pay whether they took the class or not, and it would be for six months.\" According to Command, members of the Revolution showed up, along with the Time, Denise \"Vanity\" Matthews and Apollonia Kotero.\n\nCommand said he didn't know who Prince was.\n\n\"He was so shy, and so dear. He wore pedal-pusher tights, T-shirts and ballet slippers. He was so darling, it took him two months to look me in the eye.\" Command snagged a job choreographing for \"Purple Rain\" (and also wound up dancing in Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" video).\n\nBallet of the Dolls dancer Valerie Torres-Comvalius studied at MDT as a girl.\n\n\"My sister Vanessa and I would sneak up to the studio to spy, watching him in his skintight purple pants, heels and matching bandanna on his head, gold cross necklace hanging from his neck, practicing his turns over and over,\" she said.\n\n\"His bodyguard, Big Chick, would come out and yell in a booming voice, 'What are you kids doing here?!' scaring the hell out of us, but then would proceed to let us stay and continue watching.\"\n\nPrince \"had such a phenomenal work ethic, and so do most dancers,\" she said. \"So I suppose he could really relate to just how much goes into it all.\"\n\nSaving the Joffrey Ballet\n\nMDT wasn't the only dance company Prince cared about. During the early 1990s, Joffrey Ballet donor Patricia Kennedy brought him to a performance in Los Angeles. Prince was so inspired he offered to write music for a new piece.\n\nHe not only wrote an extended version of his song \"Thunder\" from the album \"Diamonds and Pearls\" but also permitted use of his music free of charge for five years with no royalty expectations. It helped save the financially foundering company.\n\nPrince's generosity led to the rock ballet \"Billboards.\" When it premiered in 1993 in Iowa City, the audience roared. \"We were used to hearing some 'bravos' and polite applause,\" said longtime company member Suzanne Lopez. \"But this was like being at a rock concert. We knew it would be a hit. And for five years that is almost exclusively what we did.\"\n\nAs \"Billboards\" sold out theaters across the nation, it became \"a testament to [Prince's] artistic ability to bring attention to our community and enhance new aspects of our dance world,\" said Lynn Von Eschen, executive director of the Cowles Center in Minneapolis.\n\nWashington Post dance journalist Sarah Kaufman observed that \"Billboards\" was \"emblematic of his genius in that each song was a whole universe of feeling and imagery and atmosphere without being prescriptive. Prince had such a poetic style that it could inspire another creative response from the dancers.\"\n\nForming his own troupe\n\nDuring the early 1990s, when Prince was affiliated with the Minneapolis nightclub Glam Slam, he formed a dance company, led by choreographer Kat Carroll, with Jamie King, Leah Nelson and others also contributing. The troupe had various names including Glam Slam, Erotic City and Club 110 dancers.\n\nPrince \"was as meticulous with the dancers as he was with the musicians,\" Carroll said. \"We worked very hard, and he treated us very well and he paid us very well. But he also expected us to be on top of things, just like his musicians. We worked long hours, many times during the week.\"\n\nCompany member Colleen McClellan Ueland remembers his openness to ideas. \"He really appreciated your individual style. He did not stock his club with dancers who all looked the same. I was a plain Jane girl, but I got to stay because I could really dance to that music. I could have gone to Los Angeles with my looks and not gotten any work.\"\n\nPrince was battling with his label Warner Bros. Records at the time and much of the music the dancers used was unreleased. In addition to top-notch hairstyling and make-up, they had access to a dazzling array of costumes -- including clothes that had been designed personally for Prince. (Many of these \"rejects\" were tight on even the smallest dancers, McClellan Ueland recalled.\n\nA favorite memory is Prince performing an entire set behind a curtain, showing only his guitar and hands briefly, driving the crowd crazy.\n\n\"That's the kind of power he had,\" she said. \"No one could get mad at him, and people would go home with a story. His sense of humor was so special. He was always [messing] with everybody.\"\n\nShe said, \"Those two years dancing for him were so formative. It was all I needed to catapult my dance career for the next 25 years.\"\n\nThe dancers also appeared in videos and were tasked with summoning fans to Paisley Park performances. Carroll was a key collaborator in 1994's \"Prince Interactive\" CD-ROM that included video games, music and a virtual tour of Paisley Park. She credited Prince with instilling in her a strong \"work ethic, artistry, drive and passion,\" and for reminding her to always look to others for inspiration as well as herself.\n\n\"He believed in me and taught me that if I would eat, sleep and drink my work, I could reach my biggest potential.\"\n\nCaroline Palmer is a longtime Twin Cities dance critic.","330":"Daniel Oturu becomes Gophers' first All-America team selection since 1999 Being awarded for one of the best seasons for a big man in Gophers history, sophomore Daniel Oturu was named to the Sporting News All-America third team on Wednesday.\n\nOturu, who averaged 20 points while leading the Big Ten in rebounding, blocks and field goal percentage, is the first Gophers player to be named an All-America since Quincy Lewis in 1998-99.\n\nSometimes the numbers just don't lie.\n\nThe 6-foot-10, 240-pound center was the only player in the country averaging 20 points and 11 rebounds. He was was left off the All-Big Ten first team partly because of the Gophers' 14-16 record, but he proved to be one of the 15 best players in college basketball.\n\n\"He's obviously had one of the most productive years for a big man in Gophers history,\" Gophers coach Richard Pitino said about Oturu on Monday.\n\nThe Cretin-Derham Hall product finished second in the Big Ten in scoring (20.0), first in rebounding (11.6), first in field goal percentage (56.2) and first in blocks (2.6). The last Big Ten player to finish first in the latter three categories was Ohio State's former No. 1 pick Greg Oden in 2007.\n\nThe Gophers, who open the Big Ten tournament on Wednesday against Northwestern, saw Oturu become the first player since John Kundla in 1966 to record a 20-point, 20-rebound game in a Dec. 28 victory against Florida International. That was a sign of things to come.\n\nThe Woodbury native had 29 points and 18 rebounds in a double-overtime Jan. 2 loss at Purdue. He eventually posted two 30-point games, including a career-high 32 points and 16 rebounds Feb. 8 at Penn State.\n\n\"I think my game has taken a huge step forward,\" Oturu said. \"Playing with more confidence and shooting the ball a lot more showing my perimeter touch. Now that I've shown the ability to shoot the three and shoot jump shots, I can take my defender off the dribble and have more space to work.\"\n\nIn the regular season, Oturu scored 20 points or more 17 times this year, while also having 12 games with at least 20 points and 10 rebounds, tied for second in school single-season history with Kris Humphries in 2003-04. He's also 17-for-50 from three-point range after shooting just 1-for-2 from long distance last year.\n\nLast season, Oturu averaged 10.8 points, 7.0 rebounds and 1.3 blocks as a freshman on an NCAA tournament team in 2018-19, but now he's projected to be the first U player drafted since Humphries.\n\nLewis was an Associated Press and NABC third-team All-America selection in 1998-99.

A quality bouncer is appreciated by everyone, but as soon as it strikes the batsman on the head, it takes your memory back to 2014 when Australia's left-handed batsman Phil Hughes was felled by a short-pitch delivery. Hughes was struck on the back of the neck by a bouncer while batting for the West End Redbacks in a Sheffield Shield match against New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground on November 25, 2014, and this resulted in the death of the cricketer.\n\nSo, from there on, even the mighty Australian team has had a change in outlook towards dealing with bouncers.\n\nA similar thing happened during Ashes 2019 when Steve Smith was hit on the head by a ball bowled by Jofra Archer, and immediately the batsman fell to the ground, sending the entire Australian cricket team in worry.\n\nOpening batsman David Warner has opened up on the recently-released documentary of Australian cricket team titled 'The Test' on Amazon Prime Video.\n\n\"When I saw him go down, we were all just like not again, not. Please it cannot happen,\" said Warner recalling the incident of Smith getting hit on the head during the second Ashes Test at Lord's Cricket Ground.\n\nAustralian cricketers Peter Siddle and Usman Khawaja also shared what it was like to see Smith laying on the ground after being hit.\n\n\"I think we were all in shock. I think the worst was when he was laying there. That was probably the scariest moment for us all,\" Siddle said.\n\n\"We never thought it would happen.

A professional mediator may be able to help with the conversation if you can't do this by yourselves.\n\nDEAR ABBY: My two grandchildren, 12 and 16, used to spend a lot of time with my husband and me, staying overnight, going on trips, etc. As they have gotten older, I recognize that they will naturally want to spend less time with us old folks.\n\nMy problem is, when I send them texts to invite them for lunch or out somewhere for the day, they don't respond or just respond with an IDK (I don't know). My question: Should I ask again to get an answer before the scheduled lunch or trip, or should I just forget it and assume they don't want to be involved with us? -- SAD MEMAW IN FLORIDA\n\nDEAR SAD: You have asked an intelligent question, but you are asking the wrong person.

I have been living with my second husband now for 21 years. Nineteen years ago, my husband loaned one of my daughters and her husband a large sum of money so they could buy a house and pay off bills and judgments. All the necessary paperwork for the loan was signed at the time of the closing with a lawyer present, and it was agreed they would pay us back a certain amount every month.\n\nAfter a few years of mostly regular repayments, the payments dwindled, although they continued to buy expensive electronics and other items. Several years have passed now, and a few checks and cash payments have arrived, but only after much begging.\n\nOur lawyer sent them a letter a few years ago telling them to pay up or we would sue them. It resulted in their not seeing or talking to us for a couple of years. We REALLY need the money now. Maybe she's hoping we will die. What do you suggest we do at this point? Her brother and sisters don't want to get involved. -- LOVING, GIVING MOM\n\nDEAR MOM: I am truly sorry. But because your other children refuse to become involved in convincing your deadbeat daughter and her husband to pay what they owe you, you have no other choice but to contact the lawyer who drafted the loan agreement and instruct him to follow through.\n\nDEAR ABBY: My husband retired four years ago. At first he seemed to enjoy not having to go to work. Then he got bored and needed something to do. For some reason, he bought an old Corvette to restore. I was supportive, until I found out it's an expensive hobby. Finding and buying all the replacement parts costs money.\n\nHe has been working on that car for 3 1\/2 years now. As soon as he gets it ready to drive, something else breaks. Meanwhile, he has bought four more old Corvettes \"to work on.\" Our backyard looks like a junkyard.\n\nWe haven't had a vacation trip since he retired, not even a weekend to the mountains. He argues that we can't afford it, but he spends thousands on those old cars. It has become an obsession for him, and it's \"driving\" ME crazy. Any suggestions? -- CORVETTE WIDOW IN THE SOUTH\n\nDEAR WIDOW: Healthy couples discuss large purchases before making them. What your husband is doing is destructive to your relationship. It almost seems as though he is using his hobby as a way of avoiding spending time with you. My suggestion is that you and your husband find the money to consult a marriage counselor because what's going on is unfair to you. And if you need a vacation, consider taking one by yourself or with a friend.\n\nDEAR ABBY: I will be turning 50 soon. How do I explain to my husband and parents that I just want to spend it alone? Is there something wrong with me for feeling this way? -- BIRTHDAY WISH IN IOWA\n\nDEAR BIRTHDAY WISH: People react to their birthdays, especially milestone birthdays, differently. Some are elated, while others feel depressed. Not everyone wants a lot of \"hoopla.\" If you prefer spending your 50th birthday quietly, your wish should be respected, and you should not have to go into a long explanation about why.\n\nDear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.

I have yelled at her, shown deep concern for her, threatened rehab, begged her to get help, etc.\n\nShe calls me late in the evening rambling on about ridiculous things, repeating the same stories over and over, crying, claiming she's having panic attacks and all sorts of other health ailments that are most likely caused by her drinking.

I sometimes feel like I enable her by not calling her out on all her excuses for her problems when I know well they're all because of the drinking. -- ENABLER IN MINNESOTA\n\nDEAR ENABLER: I have two suggestions for you, and I hope you will avail yourself of both. The first is to go online to al-anon.org to find the nearest location for meetings (you will find they are all over) and attend some. Al-Anon is a sister organization of Alcoholics Anonymous, and it was founded to help and support the friends and family members of people who have an alcohol problem. It will help you to understand that YOU cannot help your friend. Only SHE can do that by mustering up the resolve to quit drinking. Many alcoholics do this only after they finally realize the consequences their addiction has cost them. In this case, the price may be her friendship with you.\n\nThe second is to tell your friend -- while she is sober -- that she cannot continue calling you when she has been drinking, and that if she does, you will hang up. Then do it.\n\nDEAR ABBY: My 53-year-old brother had an affair eight years ago. He and his wife have four children. When he told his wife about it, they started sleeping in separate bedrooms. She stays with him for the kids' sake and for financial reasons.\n\nThe other woman, \"Rachael,\" recently contacted him saying she has cancer and has no family who want to take care of her. He put her up in his cabin in the mountains and hasn't told his wife. He asked what I thought, and honestly, I feel that although I am sad for Rachael, my brother should put his wife before his concern for this other woman. I'm angry with him for what he's doing to his wife.

If you didn't, you should.\n\nI find it telling that the person asking me what he should do is you and not him.

The man had been in an auto accident and suffered a traumatic brain injury. In your husband's case, it appears he either has attention deficit disorder or \"suffers\" from a lack of consideration for your feelings.

Before she moved in, the plan was to take the downstairs -- which has a living room and a bedroom -- and convert it to a bedroom and a room leading out to a patio to have another entrance to our swimming pool. But she wants to decorate that room with her furniture and use it when her friends and family visit her.\n\nMy husband says, \"She is 77. She doesn't have many more years left, so let her do what she wants.\" He always adds, \"I can tell her she isn't wanted and find somewhere for her to go, but I don't know where it would be.\" I have always given in, but he doesn't see it that way.\n\nShould I let someone come into my house and redecorate it differently than how I want it?

Despite this, I have heard from family (my parents, mostly) and close friends that I'm making a terrible mistake by dating a woman so much older.\n\nThey say it is not practical to marry a woman so much older because it will present major health and aging challenges as time goes by.

We would all go to a movie every so often or to dinner occasionally, but mostly we would stay in and play games or watch TV when we were spending time together.\n\nI'm his first girlfriend, so he was new to the concept of having someone love him in spite of every little flaw he had (which were very few). I told him so many times that no matter what was wrong, I was going to stick by his side.\n\nRecently, he's had a medical problem with a few ulcerated sores. This sometimes happens to paraplegics. Unfortunately, his doctor has said he needed to leave his apartment temporarily and go into a nursing facility to get round-the-clock care. A few months went by, with plenty of visits from friends, family, and me and my daughters. (He always introduces us as his family.)\n\nThe doctor now says he may need to stay there for a year, and I know he became immediately depressed. He sent me a text saying he thinks we should just be friends, and he doesn't want a reminder of what he can't do anymore. I feel like this isn't him, that he's jumping to rash conclusions because of stress. I don't want to end the relationship. I'm willing to keep moving forward and get through this speed bump together.\n\nHe won't answer my calls or texts, and I'm at a loss about what I should do next. I want to keep him so badly. My heart aches every day worrying about this. He may lose a year of freedom, but I'm losing a lifelong companion. -- HEAVY HEART IN PENNSYLVANIA\n\nDEAR HEAVY HEART: You really have no choice but to follow this man's lead, so do as he has asked. Remember, you promised to support him no matter what. Agree to be \"just friends,\" although it won't be easy if he wants to remain incommunicado. In the meantime, stay as active with other friends as you can. Above all, do NOT allow yourself to become socially isolated because he has chosen to isolate himself.\n\nDEAR ABBY: My daughter \"Frances\" is currently applying for graduate school and is dating a man who works in human waste management. She lives in the dorms at school. Her brother \"Harry\" was at a party recently, and a young lady told him the \"poop pumper\" has been trying to get some alone time with her. I feel I should tell Frances that her guy is on the prowl. They have been dating since Frances was 16, and my wife and I have always thought she could do better. Should we tell her? -- HOLDING MY NOSE IN OHIO\n\nDEAR HOLDING: No, HARRY should tell his sister about the person he met at the party and exactly what he was told.

I have gone through counseling sessions and am at a place in my life where I am happy and healthy.\n\nCurrently, I have a relationship with my parents, but not with my sibling. My parents often express their wish for me to have a relationship with my sibling, but I always refuse. I feel that telling them what happened at this point would only cause hurt for them. But I also feel that if I tell them, I can stop getting asked uncomfortable questions. What do you suggest? -- SURVIVOR IN SOUTH DAKOTA\n\nDEAR SURVIVOR: I suggest you tell your parents everything.

I assume you are both young and graduating from high school.\n\nThis is not necessarily a question of where his priorities lie. While three to five years seems like a large chunk of time, the military may provide your boyfriend with the chance to decide what he wants to do career-wise with his life. It would also provide benefits that could positively affect his future -- and yours -- once his term of service is finished. If you feel unable to wait for him, you should let him go.\n\nDEAR ABBY: My mother is 88 and in a nursing home. While cleaning out her apartment, I found her will.

The note instructed my son to give the ring to his wife.\n\nI have not shown the note to my sister because I know she will be upset. I want to give the ring to my son.

You mentioned that you \"recently\" quit drinking. I wish you had mentioned how long ago because it may have something to do with how you are being treated now.\n\nAll you can do to change people's perception of you is sincerely apologize and try to make amends to anyone you may have hurt or offended while you were under the influence.

Four years ago, I discovered a wonderful medical practitioner and, by adhering to her protocol, regained such improved health that I began volunteering with a local organization. Due to a recent setback, however, fatigue has prevented me from volunteering, and my absence has been noticed.\n\nAlthough I am usually a private person, I decided to divulge my health issues to the leader so he wouldn't think I was unhappy with my duties.

We use the sliding theory of Lliboutry (1968) to explore how friction between debris particles in sliding ice and a rock bed affects this relationship between shear stress and slip velocity. Particle-bed contact forces and associated debris friction increase with increasing slip velocity, owing to increased rates of ice convergence with up-glacier facing surfaces. However, debris friction on diminished areas of the bed counteracts this effect as cavities grow. Thus, friction from debris alone increases only slightly with slip velocity, and for sediment particles larger than ~60 mm in diameter, debris friction peaks and decreases with increasing slip velocity. The effect on the sliding relationship is to steepen its rising limb and shift its shear stress peak to a slightly higher velocity. These results, which exclude the effect of debris friction on cavity size and debris concentrations above ~15%, indicate that the effect of debris in ice is to increase basal shear stress but not significantly change the form of the sliding relationship.","351":"Deceleration of China's human water use and its key drivers This article requires a subscription to view the full text.

These findings underscore the value of technological adoptions, including a determination of their potential, to help in designing targets and incentives for water scarcity mitigations.","352":"Deciphering 'Essential' During the COVID-19 Pandemic On Monday, March 16, Santa Cruz County in Northern California issued a shelter-in-place order due to the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring residents to stay home and limiting full business operations to companies deemed \"essential,\" like medical facilities and trash collectors. Ibis Cycles, one of a number of mountain-bike brands in Santa Cruz, announced publicly that it was closing due to the order. When employees went home that night, it was unclear when they'd return.\n\nThe next day, Ibis's executives read the order more closely, homing in on a provision that allowed non-essential businesses to maintain basic operations if they met certain conditions. Basically, as long as anyone who could work remotely did so and the rest of the staff maintained social-distancing guidelines and proper hygiene, the company could continue operating. So on Thursday, March 19, Ibis reopened -- with a stockpile of masks and gloves for its warehouse workers and measures in place to keep them apart. It was no accident that the company did not make a public declaration of its about-face. For one, employees focused initially on filling back orders, not promoting product launches and generating new sales. But there was also a squishy perception factor. \"We just kept it on the down low,\" Ibis president Tom Morgan said.\n\nWhich kind of says it all right now. A conscious, responsible mountain-bike brand is making and selling bikes, keeping its staff employed and at least some semblance of the economy in motion, going to great lengths to make sure its workers don't spread the virus -- all within the law. Yet its president doesn't really want to broadcast that Ibis is open. And he's not alone. Multiple companies contacted for this story opted not to comment on their level of operations, seemingly afraid to enter an arena where there are no right answers. Yet the same question lingers for every brand in cycling, especially since bike suppliers and shops are now deemed \"essential.\" Where does one draw the line between public health and economic stability -- nay, economic survivability -- without a precedent to go on?\n\nHope Technology didn't waffle. The U.K.-based component manufacturer ceased production on March 27, for a minimum of three weeks. Co-founder Ian Weatherill and his brother Alan, the company's sales and marketing manager and employee of 30 years, debated what to do. The local edict allowed them to keep operating, but employees were worried about the virus. \"There's a lot of interest still, there's a lot of people who want to buy parts for their bikes,\" Alan Weatherill said. \"But do they really need disc brakes? Should we be putting our products into the distribution chain? Disc brakes are not essential, although we'd like to think they are.\"\n\nHope Tech operates in a 12,000-person factory town called Barnoldswick, which includes the Rolls-Royce Aerospace factory. All factories are closed now. Hope's 160 workers were prepared to take a 20-percent pay cut since they knew the government would cover at least 80 percent of their wages if they stopped working, but Hope covered the remaining 20 in good faith. \"We have no venture-capital people, no borrowing and we own the building, so if we close, our losses aren't as big as companies with shareholders or who have rent to pay,\" Alan Weatherill said. \"It's still quite a significant hit, but we can weather it.\"\n\nBelow Hope on the accessory totem pole are hundreds of smaller brands, making up the base of the industry's pyramid, if you will. Grand Junction, Colorado-based Rocky Mounts, which was founded in 1995 and produces racks, locks and mounts, suspended its operations on March 24. All 14 employees are indefinitely furloughed, a.k.a. not getting paid.\n\nThe first sign that the sky was about to fall came quickly. \"I just started to notice our dealer orders had stopped 100 percent,\" Rocky Mounts founder and owner Bobby Noyes said. \"And the only sales channels we had left were Amazon and our website. Then Amazon said it was suspending sales of everything but medical and household products. The orders on our website started cratering, and one day at work I could tell everybody was scared.\" Noyes did some math and realized that trying to maintain a bit of revenue wasn't worth the safety risk or stress to employees. \"I'm not going to worry about selling a couple more car racks,\" he said. \"Let's just hit the reset button, walk away and come back refreshed when we know it's a brighter day.\"\n\nThere was only one problem. Rocky Mounts' sales had been up 25 percent recently, and Noyes bet big that the growth would continue. When the pandemic exploded in the U.S., he had three 40-foot containers steaming across the Pacific full of new product. The boxes travel from China to Los Angeles, catch a train to Salt Lake City, then a truck to Grand Junction, where usually the product gets unloaded and quickly shipped off to dealers. The first container arrived last week carrying about $250,000 worth of hitch racks. Only now, the dealers had no use for them.\n\n\"Literally two days before the pandemic blew up, we had a huge order ready to send to REI, then they closed all their stores,\" Noyes said. Even after paying the shipping fee and duties, he wasn't about to put six employees into the container to unload it, he told his freight company. Nor did he have anywhere to store the racks. It didn't matter. He learned he'd be on the hook to the steamship line for $250 each day the container wasn't emptied. All warehouse space in Denver was either full or outrageously expensive. His agent at Charles Schayer and Company, Gayle Meagher, who has handled his shipping for decades, told him she couldn't do anything. Already she'd had to stop fronting clients for their customs clearance fees and steamship fares -- Schayer's method of doing business for decades -- because too many companies were going under and leaving her employer stuck holding the bill.\n\n\"Gayle was in tears. And this is the hardest woman I've met in my life,\" Noyes said. \"She goes, 'Bobby, the whole system is collapsing. Everybody I've talked to this week has told me the same story.' That floored me to hear that from her. The logistics side of this thing is gonna be a bloodbath.\"\n\nWhich brings us back to Ibis. Staying in business wasn't easy, but Morgan said he and the company's owners still feel like it was worth the accommodations they made. \"It's not exactly the start to the season we expected, but all things considered, it's going pretty well,\" said Morgan, who's spoken to a number of competing manufacturers that are following a similar strategy. \"For a lot of these shops, particularly ones that have had to shut down, being able to deliver a high-end, pre-sold bike at this point may make the difference between them being able to pay their rent or make payroll, or not. So we're happy to help with that.\"\n\nAll of Ibis's 35 employees are being paid in full even though most are working about 30 hours, Morgan said. Two warehouse workers approached management and said they didn't feel comfortable working in the warehouse -- but they still needed a job. One has a degree in environmental studies, so he's been researching ways to reduce Ibis's packaging waste. Another is selling all of the company's old demo and test gear -- stuff that piles up at every warehouse and collects dust because no one has time to deal with it.\n\nLest anyone confuse \"still operating\" with \"humming right along,\" the status quo is not comfortable. Lines are blurry. Is a high-end mountain bike really an essential product right now? \"We're doing our best to question ourselves and question each step that we're taking,\" Morgan said. \"And I think that the first question we're always asking is: Are we doing what's right in terms of the health and welfare of our staff? So far, I think, yes. But we're learning on the go.\"","353":"Decoding across sensory modalities reveals common supramodal signatures of conscious perception An outstanding goal in cognitive neuroscience is to understand the relationship between neurophysiological processes and conscious experiences. More or less implicitly, it is assumed that common supramodal processes may underlie conscious perception in different sensory modalities. We tested this idea directly using decoding analysis on brain activity following near-threshold stimulation, investigating common neural correlates of conscious perception between different sensory modalities. Our results across all tested sensory modalities revealed the specific dynamic of a supramodal brain network interestingly including task-unrelated primary sensory cortices. Our findings provide direct evidence of a common distributed activation pattern related to conscious access in different sensory modalities.\n\nAn increasing number of studies highlight common brain regions and processes in mediating conscious sensory experience. While most studies have been performed in the visual modality, it is implicitly assumed that similar processes are involved in other sensory modalities. However, the existence of supramodal neural processes related to conscious perception has not been convincingly shown so far. Here, we aim to directly address this issue by investigating whether neural correlates of conscious perception in one modality can predict conscious perception in a different modality. In two separate experiments, we presented participants with successive blocks of near-threshold tasks involving subjective reports of tactile, visual, or auditory stimuli during the same magnetoencephalography (MEG) acquisition. Using decoding analysis in the poststimulus period between sensory modalities, our first experiment uncovered supramodal spatiotemporal neural activity patterns predicting conscious perception of the feeble stimulation. Strikingly, these supramodal patterns included activity in primary sensory regions not directly relevant to the task (e.g., neural activity in visual cortex predicting conscious perception of auditory near-threshold stimulation). We carefully replicate our results in a control experiment that furthermore show that the relevant patterns are independent of the type of report (i.e., whether conscious perception was reported by pressing or withholding a button press). Using standard paradigms for probing neural correlates of conscious perception, our findings reveal a common signature of conscious access across sensory modalities and illustrate the temporally late and widespread broadcasting of neural representations, even into task-unrelated primary sensory processing regions.","354":"Deep Transitions podcast series launches The Deep Transitions Research Programme has launched its new podcast series.

The problem is that he had set the bar so high as the MVP at 19, and then after the knee injury, everybody wondered whether he could get back to that. He was the only person who was ever that. Can he get back to where nobody else was? In the three or four years after his injuries, he was still giving you 18 (points) and 5 (assists); it wasn't like he was a scrub,\" Isiah Thomas said about the new Pistons guard in an interview with Rod Beard of The Detriot News.\n\n\"I thought Detroit would like him and embrace him and vice versa because his game fits Detroit. I'm not surprised at the season he had and the professionalism he exhibited. He was playing hard, not taking nights off and playing all hard minutes. That last Phoenix game (a season-high 31 points on Feb. 28), that was about as beautiful as we've seen any guard play this year. He fits what Detroit is all about. You want young players around him.\"\n\nDerrick Rose was averaging 18.1 points, 2.4 rebounds and 5.6 assists in 50 games for the Pistons before the 2019-20 season was suspended. The former Chicago Bulls superstar was shooting 49.0 percent from the floor, 30.6 percent from beyond the arc and 87.1 percent from the free-throw line.\n\nThe Pistons had an awful record of 20-46 before Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19. Detroit got a bunch of trade calls on Rose at the trade deadline, but they decided to keep Rose because they want to be competitive in 2020-21 when All-Star power forward Blake Griffin returns from his knee injury.\n\nRose, the youngest MVP in NBA history, has career averages of 18.8 points, 3.4 rebounds and 5.6 assists with the Bulls, New York Knicks, Cleveland Cavaliers, Minnesota Timberwolves and Pistons.\n\nJUST IN: Adam Silver still uncertain about future of NBA despite desire to finish regular season Related TopicsDerrick RoseIsiah ThomasPistons","361":"Designing heterotropically activated allosteric conformational switches using supercharging We present a general method to imbue proteins with heterotropic allostery by using surface protein supercharging to impart intrinsic disorder to the protein fold, allowing for functional activation by low concentrations of multivalent ions, including Mg(II), Ca(II), and spermine. We have designed two different proteins which exhibit this property and present a protocol which anyone can employ to impart this property to their protein of interest. This method promises to enable future synthetic biology projects which utilize natural fluxes of these ions to directly actuate function at significantly faster rates than that of genetic activation. Such multivalent ionic activation of disordered proteins may be a mechanism utilized by Nature which has yet to be appreciated.\n\nHeterotropic allosteric activation of protein function, in which binding of one ligand thermodynamically activates the binding of another, different ligand or substrate, is a fundamental control mechanism in metabolism and as such has been a long-aspired capability in protein design. Here we show that greatly increasing the magnitude of a protein's net charge using surface supercharging transforms that protein into an allosteric ligand- and counterion-gated conformational molecular switch. To demonstrate this we first modified the designed helical bundle hemoprotein H4, creating a highly charged protein which both unfolds reversibly at low ionic strength and undergoes the ligand-induced folding transition commonly observed in signal transduction by intrinsically disordered proteins in biology. As a result of the high surface-charge density, ligand binding to this protein is allosterically activated up to 1,300-fold by low concentrations of divalent cations and the polyamine spermine. To extend this process further using a natural protein, we similarly modified Escherichia coli cytochrome b and the resulting protein behaves in a like manner. These simple model systems not only establish a set of general engineering principles which can be used to convert natural and designed soluble proteins into allosteric molecular switches useful in biodesign, sensing, and synthetic biology, the behavior we have demonstrated--functional activation of supercharged intrinsically disordered proteins by low concentrations of multivalent ions--may be a control mechanism utilized by Nature which has yet to be appreciated.","362":"Despite Risks, Cancer Patients Should Continue Chemotherapy Treatment During Coronavirus Pandemic, Doctor Says Hospitals across the country are being forced to delay or cancel some medical procedures due to the surge of patients with COVID-19, resulting in some cancer patients seeing changes in how they're getting care.\n\nVelma Johnson, 63, was recently diagnosed with Stage 4 lung cancer.

In PNAS, Ben-Hur and Kadmon (3) demonstrate that area and heterogeneity may themselves be fundamentally entwined, creating unappreciated, yet potentially ubiquitous thresholds in how species diversity accrues. These results have exciting implications for predicting and preserving species diversity.\n\nTwo maxims in community ecology are that area and heterogeneity are positively related to species diversity (2): As area and heterogeneity increase, theory predicts that the number of species in an ecological community generally increase, too. For a given amount of total area, a geometric certainty is that increasing the number of habitats in that area (i.e., increasing heterogeneity) means that the average area of each habitat must decrease. Since this area-heterogeneity tradeoff (AHTO) arises due to a fundamental geometrical constraint (4, 5), it is theoretically ubiquitous in ecological systems. Furthermore, because conservation decisions center on the size and heterogeneity of habitats to target for protection (6, 7), the AHTO could also be an important tool for guiding conservation around the globe. In their paper, Ben-Hur and Kadmon (3) use multispecies plant communities and multiple years of data to provide an important experimental test of the predictions of the AHTO. Their study is compelling not only for what they find but also because of what they do not find.\n\nThe AHTO is predicted to generate a hump-shaped (i.e., unimodal) relationship between richness and heterogeneity (4, 5) (Fig. 1).

We found a specific truncation of Dicer in monocytic cells resulting from apparently constitutive cleavage by a serine protease. Inhibition of this proteolytic truncation, which occurred during macrophage differentiation in presence of TLR ligands or prostaglandin E, up-regulates full-length Dicer and promotes miR biosynthesis. Regulation of transcription of pri-miRNA is one mode to regulate biosynthesis of mature miRNA. Inhibition of constitutive proteolysis of Dicer, as described here, provides a second layer of regulation, at the level of miRNA processing. Our data provide insights to Dicer and miRNAs in macrophage polarization\/differentiation, a key process in the innate immune response.","366":"Digital training can help supervisors lift PhD output The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations\n\nSeveral African countries have increased the number of new universities and increased enrolments as part of an effort to boost tertiary education and development.\n\nMore recently, there has been an increased emphasis on doctoral degrees. Some countries have set ambitious targets for the number of doctoral degrees. And Nigeria and Kenya now demand that all university lecturers have doctoral degrees.\n\nThe push for higher doctoral output has increased postgraduate enrolments. But this has not necessarily translated into sufficient numbers of successful completions. One of the reasons for this is the need for well trained supervisors.\n\nAcross the world policy makers acknowledge the crucial role of supervision in postgraduate education. An online short training programme has been developed at Stellenbosch University in South Africa to provide support for supervisors. The training course is specifically aimed at supervisors at African universities.\n\nWhat we found\n\nThe online course grew out of a seminar on doctoral quality at African universities in 2016. A proposal was made for an online short training programme for supervisors with a specific focus on the needs and conditions in African countries. In many universities doctoral students often have to pursue their research in resource-poor and adverse conditions.\n\nThe first offering in 2018 drew 152 enrolments and 135 enrolled in 2019. Further offerings are planned for 2020 and beyond. So far participants have come from 25 different African countries. The course has achieved a success rate of 73%.\n\nThis uptake and completion illustrate that there is clearly a demand for doctoral supervision training at African universities.\n\nThe course also provides an opportunity to find some answers to important questions. First, why higher doctoral enrolments may not always be translating into graduations. Second, why there are ongoing concerns about quality.\n\nWe posed these questions during the course and also analysed data from 25 789 online forum discussion posts and 123 essays submitted by the participants of the course.\n\nAll the participants held PhDs, representing a range of different fields of studies. There was close to a 50-50 distribution between the sciences and the humanities. They all acknowledged the challenges linked to the rapid expansion of doctoral programmes and enrolments in their countries. They maintained, nevertheless, that more doctorates were a national priority for economic and social development.\n\nMany participants commented on the high drop-out rates in their countries. These are, for example, up to 50% reported at some universities in Kenya and up to 60% at some universities in South Africa. They also observed the long time it took to graduate - with an average of 6 years reported in some countries, but often longer.\n\nThe challenges for supervision and doctoral research identified correspond with the findings of the International University Association. These issues are largely related to resource constraints - physical and financial resources, infrastructure and human resources.\n\nConstraints\n\nAmong the most prominent institutional factors identified were deficient application and inadequate screening processes of prospective doctoral students. Universities, especially new ones, were ill prepared to provide and support doctoral programmes in the absence of well-functioning graduate schools and similar institutional support structures.\n\nInadequate library services and lack of an adequate technical and administrative infrastructure were among the other constraints.\n\nIn such an environment, the supervisor's role goes beyond the academic dimensions of doctoral supervision. But many participants identified inadequate supervisor capacity as a major problem. In many universities a large number, if not a majority, of lecturers do not hold doctoral degrees themselves. So they cannot supervise the increasing numbers of doctoral students.\n\nSupervisors were stretched thin. And, in many instances, they had to supervise students on topics outside their area of expertise.\n\nSupervisors reported that they often felt ill prepared to supervise and mentor doctoral students. This can lead to outdated and poor supervision practices (for example, working in isolation, long delays in feedback, superficial feedback limited to formal and grammatical issues in stead of substantial issues). This was widely seen as one of the reasons for high drop-out rates and questionable quality standards.\n\nSolutions\n\nMany participants saw solutions coming from the same source: the supervisor. Supervisors are expected to play a multifaceted role in their charge's doctoral project. They are the editor, librarian, administrative support, project manager and personal mentor. They are also the teacher of digital and information literacy skills and writing skills, and the examiner.\n\nNevertheless, many participants saw this online training course as an opportunity to make a real difference in their institutions. They could benefit students by shaping better institutional policies, promoting responsible and ethical research practices, and maintaining good research standards.\n\nParticipants further highlighted the need for more experienced supervisors to mentor novice supervisors.\n\nThe success of this course demonstrates that online education can be used effectively to meet the increasing demand for self-paced professional development opportunities for academics at African universities. This comes with significant benefits in relation to scale and cost. Yet, there is still a tendency to focus on the constraints. This includes issues such as limited internet connectivity, limited digital resources and low levels of digital literacy.\n\nOur experience demonstrated these were indeed challenges. But they weren't deal breakers. For example we found we had to strike a balance between learning material that could be downloaded for offline learning, and interactive, online learning activities.","367":"Direct experimental evidence of physical origin of electronic phase separation in manganites This article requires a subscription to view the full text.

(AP) -- Students and teachers at all levels of education are transitioning from classroom to computer as the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases continues to rise. Not every subject lends itself to a smooth transition to distance learning, as students and instructors have discovered.\n\n\"I think we're all really frustrated,\" said Jordyn Wade, a fashion design major at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. \"But we know that our professors are doing what they can in a really unprecedented situation.\"\n\nWade said that she and her classmates are now meeting remotely through Zoom, a video conferencing platform. Zoom allows students to meet virtually during a time when people can't meet physically, but distance learning poses challenges for courses that require more than a lecture, like art classes and lab components of science classes.\n\nStudents like Wade worked mostly with industrial grade equipment.\n\n\"We kind of rely heavily on the school for supplies like sewing machines and the industrial equipment that can cost thousands of dollars,\" Wade said. \"Now we just stare at each other and they ask us,'What can you guys do? Can you hand sew an entire jacket before the end of the month?'\"\n\nWade said that one of the most frustrating aspects of distance learning is not being able to receive direct feedback from professors.\n\n\"We can't ask our professors what's wrong with the garment that we're making, we can just send them pictures and hope they can figure it out from afar,\" Wade said.\n\nChloe Pallak, a student in VCU's art program said that many of her projects are being graded on whether or not they are complete.\n\n\"To get a grade for an assignment, you just have to do it,\" Pallak said. \"It really takes away the motivation of wanting to make art and not just complete the assignment.\"\n\nCourses that include lab components, such as classes in environmental science, also face challenges as classes move online. Griffin Erney, an environmental studies major at VCU, said that distance learning prevents students from accessing lab materials that are typically provided in the classroom.\n\n\"Before the class was online we would just do different activities and be provided with the materials,\" Erney said. \"Having labs online is more challenging, on top of all the work that we already have.\"\n\nOn Monday, Gov. Ralph Northam issued an order that closed down all K-12 schools in the state for the remainder of the 2019-2020 school year.\n\nDavide D'Urbino, a chemistry and organic chemistry teacher at Clover Hill High School in Chesterfield County, said he plans on using computer applications to supplement labs that cannot be completed in the classroom. He said the school division requested that teachers hold off on introducing new learning material.\n\n\"The expectation was that you could teach new stuff, but then you have to go back in class and reteach it,\" D'Urbino said.\n\nD'Urbino said teachers aren't allowed to teach new material online because some students may not have internet access. He said he understands why the school division has placed these restrictions but said it \"feels weird.\"\n\nDistance learning has also presented challenges to teachers trying to adapt to lecturing online.\n\n\"Some people say teaching is 75 percent theater, you just go out there and do improv. You can't really do that online,\" D'Urbino said. \"It's very difficult to intervene and correct course if you realize something isn't quite working out.\"\n\nTeachers have also scrambled for ways to continue instruction for students that lack access to the internet.\n\nJanice Barton, a 5th grade science teacher at Honaker Elementary School in Russell County, said that about half of the 60 students she teaches have access to the internet. She said the school is using Google Classroom, a web platform that allows teachers to share files with students through the internet. For students without internet access, teachers create physical packets of learning content.\n\n\"We're working as grade levels, we're going in and working together to put the packets together,\" Barton said. \"We have pickup days and drop-off days, and that's how we are working and dealing with this right now.\"\n\nBarton said the school uses phone calls, emails, and the app Remind, which allows teachers to send messages to students to keep in contact with parents and students.\n\nWhile local school divisions are tasked with making decisions on how to pursue distance learning, the Virginia Department of Education issued guidance to help divisions continue instruction.\n\nVDOE's guidance to local school divisions includes offering instruction during the summer of 2020, extending the school term or adjusting the next, and adding learning modules to extended school calendars.\n\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction James Lane issued guidance regarding eight high school senior graduation requirements and will be issuing further guidance for half of those, which can not be waived outright.\n\nTwo other graduation requirements -- training in emergency first aid and the completion of a virtual course -- require action by the General Assembly in order to be waived.\n\nCopyright 2020 Associated Press.

This cooperative division of labor is facilitated via long-range electrical currents that run from cell to cell along a network of conductive fibers. Here we show that biomass synthesis shows a surprising asymmetry along the filament: only the cells oxidizing the electron donor conserve energy for growth, while the other cells reduce electron acceptors without biosynthesis.

Are they safer? More secure? Great questions.\n\nFirst, let's define a double-keyed deadbolt. It's a deadbolt that locks from the inside and the outside with a key. This means if the door is locked, there's no getting in or out without a key.\n\nPolice officers seem to prefer double-keyed deadbolts because of added security. It's fairly easy to break into a home with a glass sidelite (window) on the front door. The burglar simply smashes the glass, and then they can reach in to unlock the door.\n\nPolice officers also like double-keyed deadbolts because they make it difficult to steal big stuff. If someone gains entry to a home by sneaking through a window, they can get out of the house very quickly with a lot of stuff by opening from the front door from the inside. With double-keyed deadbolt locks, however, that's not such an easy option.\n\nThese are the arguments I've heard. I'm not here to debate the validity of these argument, but here goes anyway. One or two well-placed spartan kicks from a large person is all it would take to destroy a door jamb, rendering any type of deadbolt useless.\n\nBut to go down the rabbit-hole even further, the whole kick-in-the-door thing is a good reason to consider a jamb reinforcement kit like the StrikeMaster II for added security.\n\nThe problem with double-keyed deadbolts is reduced safety. If someone needs to get out of their home during an emergency but the double-keyed deadbolt is locked, you're stuck looking for a key or a window to climb out of.

Dr. Mark Seeley has details in this week's edition of Minnesota WeatherTalk: \"...With the frequent freeze-thaw cycles and the general lack of precipitation so far this month (many areas had not reported any precipitation or only a trace for 16 consecutive days), much of the water-laden snow cover across the state has been gradually disappearing, helping to alleviate some of the high flood risk. The National Weather Service did have a number of flood warnings in place this week in western portions of the state due to the rate of melting snow, and in some cases ice jams.

Wake, University of California, Berkeley, CA, and approved January 22, 2020 (received for review October 31, 2019)\n\nAnimals protected by sequestered toxins must employ an alternative source of defensive chemicals when a shift in diet evolves. Snakes of the genus Rhabdophis possess defensive glands that store powerful defensive toxins known as bufadienolides. The ancestral prey of Rhabdophis consists of anuran amphibians, including toads (Bufonidae) that are the source of sequestered bufadienolides. However, members of a derived clade of Rhabdophis consume nontoxic earthworms as their primary prey, yet their integumentary glands still contain bufadienolides. We demonstrate that snakes in the worm-eating clade obtain their defensive toxins primarily by consuming larval fireflies. Our finding represents a remarkable evolutionary example in which a shift from vertebrate to nonvertebrate prey provides the same chemical class of sequestered defensive toxins.","377":"Drilling surprise opens door to volcano-powered electricity The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations\n\nCan enormous heat deep in the earth be harnessed to provide energy for us on the surface? A promising report from a geothermal borehole project that accidentally struck magma - the same fiery, molten rock that spews from volcanoes - suggests it could.\n\nThe Icelandic Deep Drilling Project, IDDP, has been drilling shafts up to 5km deep in an attempt to harness the heat in the volcanic bedrock far below the surface of Iceland.\n\nBut in 2009 their borehole at Krafla, northeast Iceland, reached only 2,100m deep before unexpectedly striking a pocket of magma intruding into the Earth's upper crust from below, at searing temperatures of 900-1000\u00b0C.\n\nThis borehole, IDDP-1, was the first in a series of wells drilled by the IDDP in Iceland looking for usable geothermal resources. The special report in this month's Geothermics journal details the engineering feats and scientific results that came from the decision not to the plug the hole with concrete, as in a previous case in Hawaii in 2007, but instead attempt to harness the incredible geothermal heat.\n\nWilfred Elders, professor emeritus of geology at the University of California, Riverside, co-authored three of the research papers in the Geothermics special issue with Icelandic colleagues.\n\n\"Drilling into magma is a very rare occurrence, and this is only the second known instance anywhere in the world,\" Elders said. The IDDP and Iceland's National Power Company, which operates the Krafla geothermal power plant nearby, decided to make a substantial investment to investigate the hole further.\n\nThis meant cementing a steel casing into the well, leaving a perforated section at the bottom closest to the magma. Heat was allowed to slowly build in the borehole, and eventually superheated steam flowed up through the well for the next two years.\n\nElders said that the success of the drilling was \"amazing, to say the least\", adding: \"This could lead to a revolution in the energy efficiency of high-temperature geothermal projects in the future.\"\n\nThe well funnelled superheated, high-pressure steam for months at temperatures of over 450\u00b0C - a world record. In comparison, geothermal resources in the UK rarely reach higher than around 60-80\u00b0C.\n\nThe magma-heated steam was measured to be capable of generating 36MW of electrical power. While relatively modest compared to a typical 660MW coal-fired power station, this is considerably more than the 1-3MW of an average wind turbine, and more than half of the Krafla plant's current 60MW output.\n\nMost importantly it demonstrated that it could be done. \"Essentially, IDDP-1 is the world's first magma-enhanced geothermal system, the first to supply heat directly from molten magma,\" Elders said. The borehole was being set up to deliver steam directly into the Krafla power plant when a valve failed which required the borehole to be stoppered. Elders added that although the borehole had to plugged, the aim is to repair it or drill another well nearby.\n\nGillian Foulger, professor of geophysics at Durham University, worked at the Kravla site in the 1980s during a period of volcanic activity. \"A well at this depth can't have been expected to hit magma, but at the same time it can't have been that surprising,\" she said. \"At one point when I was there we had magma gushing out of one of the boreholes,\" she recalled.\n\nVolcanic regions such as Iceland are not active most of the time, but can suddenly be activated by movement in the earth tens of kilometres below that fill chambers above with magma. \"They can become very dynamic, raised in pressure, and even force magma to the surface. But if it's not activated, then there's no reason to expect a violent eruption, even if you drill into it,\" she said.\n\n\"Having said that, with only one experimental account to go on, it wouldn't be a good idea to drill like this in a volcanic region anywhere near a city,\" she added.\n\nThe team, she said, deserved credit for using the opportunity to do research. \"Most people faced with tapping into a magma chamber would pack their bags and leave,\" she said. \"But when life gives you lemons, you make lemonade.\"\n\nIn Iceland, around 90% of homes are heated from geothermal sources. According to the International Geothermal Association, 10,700MW of geothermal electricity was generated worldwide in 2010. Typically, these enhanced or engineered geothermal systems are created by pumping cold water into hot, dry rocks at depths of between 4-5km. The heated water is pumped up again as hot water or steam from production wells. The trend in recent decades has been steady growth in geothermal power, with Iceland, the Philippines and El Salvador leading the way, producing between 25-30% of their power from geothermal sources. Considerable effort invested in elsewher including Europe, Australia, the US, and Japan, has typically had uneven results, and the cost is high.\n\nWith the deeper boreholes, the IDDP are looking for a further prize: supercritical water; at high temperature and under high pressure deep underground, the water enters a supercritical state, when it is neither gas nor liquid. In this state it carries far more energy and, harnessed correctly, this can increase the power output above ground tenfold, from 5MW to 50MW.\n\nElders said: \"While the experiment at Krafla suffered various setbacks that pushed personnel and equipment to their limits, the process itself was very instructive. As well as the published scientific articles we've prepared comprehensive reports on the practical lessons learned.\" The Icelandic National Power Company will put these towards improving their next drilling operations.\n\nThe IDDP is a collaboration of three energy companies, HS Energy Ltd, National Power Company and Reykjavik Energy, and the National Energy Authority of Iceland, with a consortium of international scientists led by Elders. The next IDDP-2 borehole will be sunk in southwest Iceland at Reykjanes later this year.\n\nFor more science news, analysis and commentary, follow us on @ConversationUK.

Minnesota has filed a warrant for his return from an Eaton County jail cell southwest of Lansing.\n\nTroutman was released from a Michigan prison just two months before the crash after serving 4\u00bd years for a home burglary.\n\nAvant's mother, Carly Turner, said Friday she was caught off guard when police told her of the driver's capture.\n\n\"I was definitely elated and very relieved that we actually had a person we can hold accountable,\" said Turner, who added that her son, 16-year-old Randy Avant, was just inside the bus when his sister was hit.\n\nAs for her college-bound daughter, Turner said, \"Now that there's a face, a person and information [about the crash's circumstances], it's been a lot for her to process. Kyla is more confused as in, 'I don't understand how a person can do that.' I have more anger because I was not able to protect my child.\"\n\nAccording to the complaint:\n\nAvant landed on the car's hood and hit the ground roughly 50 feet from where she was struck, and Troutman kept driving.\n\nPolice found the car's owner and learned that he filed what turned out to be a false report with police in Minneapolis, alleging it was stolen from the 5000 block of S. Ewing Avenue, a few blocks from where the crash occurred.\n\nBut before Edina police could locate the car, Minneapolis police found it in Edina -- unaware of its connection to the crash -- and gave the owner a ride to that spot so he could retrieve it.\n\nFive days later, the car was recovered in Mankato and had damage consistent with hitting the student.\n\nLacey Severins, a spokeswoman for the Hennepin County Attorney's Office, said prosecutors \"have not foreclosed any options\" regarding filing more serious charges such as attempted murder against Troutman or seeking a sentence above state guidelines should he be convicted.\n\nThe office is reviewing the case for possibly charging others who were with Troutman that day, Severins said.","379":"Driver suspected in hit-run that injured Edina student arrested in Michigan The 26-year-old has been charged with second-degree assault and is being held in the Eaton County jail in Michigan.\n\nIt took nearly two months, but Edina police said Thursday that the driver involved in the January hit-and-run of a student who was waiting to get on the school bus has been arrested.\n\nCarlton Duke Troutman, of Michigan, was recently arrested in his home state on suspicion of hitting an Edina student and then fleeing.

It's an ambitious goal, given over 35% of the population lives in poverty, according to government statistics.\n\nBut it's one which President Paul Kagame is clearly keen to push. As he stands in front of the audience, he says that drones will become not just part of the Rwandan skies - he wants them manufactured and piloted by Rwandans.\n\nMore Technology of Business\n\nSchoolchildren watching hop up and down with excitement, hands shoot into the air when speakers talk about drone networks. \"I want to be a drone pilot,\" one girl, who can't be more than twelve, announces confidently. This is now one of the coolest jobs in Rwanda.\n\n\"In underdeveloped countries like Rwanda technology has to be adopted faster,\" says one college student called Benjamin. His classmate nods, she's studying engineering too. \"People don't know about drones, but the young can tell the older generation\" he adds.\n\nRwanda, the country of a thousand hills and slow, tediously winding roads, was the first in the world to embrace a commercial delivery service by drone when Silicon Valley firm Zipline began flying blood in 2016.\n\nIt received a huge amount of global publicity and has delivered tens of thousands of units of blood. But Zipline is an exception. Its flights are classified as government flights, meaning it has high-level exemptions when it comes to air traffic management.\n\nIt's the thorny issue of regulation and management of the lower airspace which all agree is key to the establishment of sustainable long-term drone delivery networks.\n\nWhy drone deliveries?\n\nTemie explains how her drivers have to learn the location of 400 hospitals by heart as the maps aren't accurate enough in a frantically urbanising city like Lagos, which is also clogged by traffic.\n\nDrones for her are just a way to get what's needed to patients faster. But, in Nigeria, they're not yet used for drops.\n\n\"The regulation isn't there yet,\" she says, but she and most people here believe that this will change, and that African skies, which are less congested than many parts of the world, will lead the way.

Most people walk miles up steep, high-sided hills, and the main road out of Kigali has a constant stream of foot traffic.\n\nThe lake is quiet, and still. A local fisherman tells us that's because of strict restrictions due to the neighbouring country's ongoing Ebola outbreak.\n\n\"The army says no,\" he says bluntly when we ask why there are so few boats, which would be a lot faster than roads to transport goods.\n\nThis is the Lake Kivu Challenge, the competition portion of the drone forum, and teams from around the world, mainly from Europe, are competing for contracts with the Rwandan government.\n\nIn a shed next to the hut where the little drones sit ready for their turn, we see mock-ups of blood transfusion bags and medical samples.\n\nThese will be picked up by the drones, dropped at a nearby island, then collected again within a certain time limit.\n\nSheltering in the shade we chat to Selina Herzog from German drone firm Wingcopter.

At best, they're a nuisance - the buzzing playthings of inconsiderate hobbyists or photographers taking pictures from above. At worst, they're a tool for idiots to close airports, ruin holidays and cost the country millions.\n\nBut the research Nesta Challenges has carried out over the past two years reveals a far more nuanced picture.\n\nThe public, and public services, are actually quite open to drones being used more widely - including in cities, potentially the most challenging and controversial environment for them.\n\nRead more: Gatwick drone drama shows how even unarmed UAVs can cause economic chaos and risk to life\n\nBut if this is to ever happen, there are challenges along the path to public acceptance. And these are not just the obvious ones around making sure operations are safe and reliable: people also care about what drones do, who is operating them - and where.\n\nThat's a big departure from how traditional aviation is perceived. Nobody really cares what's in any given plane or what altitude it's at, what route it's on or what airline it's owned by - as long as it's far enough overhead. And that's reflected in the laws and regulations that govern existing air traffic. Providing the pilots and equipment are certified, and they're operating safely, there are no serious restrictions on who and what gets access to the sky.\n\nBuzz needs\n\nBut it turns out that an unpiloted aircraft flying just 40 feet from our heads is quite different from an airliner 40,000 feet above. And the difference in altitude isn't just a number. Low altitude airspace means interacting with people and things on the ground, in a way that flying above the clouds doesn't.\n\nSo one thing is clear: simply replicating the rules and regulations around civil aviation won't work. The future of drone traffic will be different to present day air traffic.\n\nIn the research we carried out as part of the Flying High project, we aimed to think about this future. We wanted to better understand how people thought drones might be used in our cities, to investigate how feasible some of the more far-fetched services people are proposing are, and to paint a picture of what the urban drone system of the future would look like.\n\nWe worked with local councils, academics and businesses in five English cities, chosen in part to reflect the diversity of economics, politics and scale of the places most of us live: Bradford, London, Preston, Southampton and the West Midlands Combined Authority.\n\nInterestingly, while there were some minor local variations in how people thought drones could be used (and some rather larger variations in how much or how deeply they had thought about these possible futures), there were several consistent principles. Generally, there was interest in the public sector uses of drones (for police, fire, transport infrastructure, medical transport), support for uses that promote social and economic equity, and some degree of support for cities having a say over, or even control of, drone traffic within their borders.\n\nBut this support from cities, like support from the public, is tentative and conditional. Some of the wilder commercial applications of drones we have heard - from flying taxis to pizza delivery - found little favour.\n\nWe believe that a continued push for potentially disruptive uses like these, that bring little or no public benefit, risks turning the public against drones. We could make the same mistakes that were made with genetically modified crops in the 1990s or nuclear power in the 1960s and 70s. In these cases, legitimate concerns about how the technologies were used were ignored - and public opposition hardened, even against applications with a clear and positive story to tell.\n\nThe positive case\n\nIn our research, we were keen to find out more about some of the positive uses that could bring public benefit. These are the kinds of uses that, given the current state of public and civic opinion, are most likely to be received with an open mind.\n\nWe developed five near-future scenarios, around long- and short-haul medical transport, fire and traffic incident response, and infrastructure development, and engaged with industry experts and potential users of the technology to gauge how technically and economically feasible they would be.\n\nRead more: Iran attack: how Reaper drones really carry out airstrikes\n\nWe found that, aside from some remaining barriers to long-distance flight (flying further than the pilot can see), precision flight and automation, existing drone technology is largely capable of providing these services.\n\nHowever, regulation remains a barrier. And a large part of the issue is building up a track record of safe operation that could convince the Civil Aviation Authority to permit operations like these over built-up areas.\n\nBusiness cases - in particular, defining services in a way and at a scale which is both viable for operators and useful for customers - also still need some work, particularly for medical transportation. In short, there has so far been too much focus on technology development and not enough on developing credible services for that technology.\n\nEven if the economics of these uses are hard to project with any certainty, there is growing evidence of the macroeconomic benefits that drones could bring to the UK. In December, with PWC, we jointly published economic analysis of the value to the UK economy of urban public service drone use - projecting net savings to the UK taxpayer of over \u00a31 billion, and economic activity generated to the tune of almost \u00a37 billion over the next 15 years.\n\nBut the only way to figure this all out for real - and to find out once and for all whether the public will accept this kind of service - is to actually try it out.\n\nWe think that some of the public money allocated to the Future Flight stream of the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund needs to be spent on quickly getting live demonstrations going of public benefit drone services and testing out what the public think.\n\nSpending time and money on boondoggles such as flying taxis or online deliveries for the rich, or focusing exclusively on technology development without buy-in from the public or a credible business or service model, doesn't just risk wasting money, it puts at risk the real benefits that we have found drones could bring to our public services.","384":"Duluth becomes bald eagle hub during spring migration DULUTH - As he scanned the sky from his overlook on Thompson Hill, John Richardson remembered a time when bald eagle sightings were rare.\n\nThis spring, the counter for Hawk Ridge Bird Observatory will see dozens -- even hundreds -- of the raptors in a single day.\n\nOver the past few decades, Duluth has become a traffic hub for birds migrating in March, April and May. With its rivers, creeks and the shoreline of Lake Superior as guiding maps from above, the city is at times the best place in the country to spot a bald eagle.\n\n\"We keep seeing more and more each year,\" Richardson said.\n\nOn a late March day in 2019, Hawk Ridge counters tallied 1,076 bald eagles -- a single-day record for any site in North America. Staff from the nonprofit observatory counted 7,727 bald eagles during the 2019 spring migration, the most recorded during the March through May season in Hawk Ridge's history.\n\n\"Of course you can see them elsewhere in Minnesota,\" Richardson said. \"But you won't see them in such concentrations as you do in Duluth.\"\n\nHe credits federal legislation protecting migratory birds and the banning of DDT, an insecticide that poisoned eagles, with saving the species that was once in danger of extinction. The bald eagle was removed from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife in 2007.\n\nAs of Monday morning, Hawk Ridge counters have seen more than 2,800 bald eagles pass through Duluth this spring, and a second wave of migrators usually starts in late April. Not all bald eagles migrate.\n\nSome of the birds will come from as far south as Florida, while others that wintered in southern Minnesota could be passing through on their way to summer nests in the most northerly forests of Canada.\n\n\"These birds could even be heading all the way to Alaska,\" Richardson said as he watched an eagle catch lift on a stream of warm air.\n\nRichardson and Frank Nicoletti, who runs Hawk Ridge's spring count, are out with a rotating handful of volunteers every day in the spring monitoring migrations.\n\nArmed with binoculars and spotting scopes, they are able to identify a bird's species (and, sometimes, gender and age) when they're just tiny specks in the sky by looking at the shapes of tails and the way the animals fly.\n\nHawk Ridge's spring count is smaller than its fall season, which ends in November. Still, as the weather warms -- sunny days with some southerly wind are the best -- many birds are on the move.\n\nThe Hawk Ridge group had its best day of the season Sunday in terms of total raptors -- 1,114, including a whopping 785 red-tailed hawks, the first common loon of the year and 91 bald eagles.\n\nThough this year's bald eagle numbers are currently behind last year's, Richardson said, the counters could still see jumps this spring. It's all dependent on the weather -- northeast winds in March may have altered the paths of the birds so that many made the journey North without passing through Duluth.\n\n\"It doesn't mean that the population is down,\" he said. \"It just means that they're not flying right over our heads.\"","385":"Dynamics of oligomer and amyloid fibril formation by yeast prion Sup35 observed by high-speed atomic force microscopy This article requires a subscription to view the full text. If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nPrions are self-templating protein conformations that form amyloid fibrils, which are highly ordered protein aggregates. Prions are not only associated with mammalian neurodegenerative diseases but also utilized to switch protein functions, as exemplified by yeast prions. We employed high-speed atomic force microscopy (HS-AFM) to determine how the amyloid fibrils elongate from the monomeric state, since HS-AFM can observe protein dynamics at subsecond and submolecular resolutions. We used the intrinsically disordered region of a yeast prion protein (Sup35NM) as a model, and successfully visualized the conversion of Sup35NM from monomers to oligomers and fibrils. This analysis not only provides direct evidence for the monomer addition to the amyloid fibrils, but also sheds light on the relationship between oligomers and fibrils.","386":"E-cigarettes: striking the right balance Natalie Walker and colleagues' Article provides evidence on New Zealand's new regulatory framework for e-cigarettes, which permitted the sale and marketing of nicotine-containing electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) in March, 2018. Before this date, the sale of e-cigarettes was illegal, although as the authors acknowledge, the law was not aggressively enforced. The data analysed by Walker and colleagues are from annual cross-sectional Year-10 student surveys, which were circulated to nearly half of New Zealand students aged 14-15 years. The findings indicate a decrease in ever having used a cigarette and daily use of cigarettes among Year-10 students, between 2014 and 2019, while ever having used an e-cigarette and daily use of e-cigarettes increased.","387":"E-learning begins for Ontario students BARRIE -- Students across Ontario begin online learning today, more than three weeks after COVID-19 shuttered schools in the name of physical distancing.\n\nTeachers will lead the effort with both live and pre-recorded lessons, but the move poses challenges nonetheless.\n\nBarrie resident Lissa Dorey has two children and says the e-learning has started well. She says while some limited devices are posing a problem in her house, it's all about adapting.\n\n\"I don't see it any different from when I was teaching them their alphabet, or their numbers when they were going into kindergarten. It's just; now the curriculums changed, now I need to teach them different things,\" she says.\n\nTeachers across Ontario are also getting used to the new approach. Grade six teacher, with the Simcoe Muskoka Catholic School Board, Chantelle Nicholl says reassuring students will play a big part in these days.\n\n\"Trying to navigate the different assignments with my students, having them take a breath. There were a lot of messages flying back and forth this morning.\"\n\nThe Ministry of Education has said that e-learning cannot fully replace the in-class experience, so the goal is to help students continue their education as much as possible during the pandemic.\n\nEducation Minister Stephen Lecce is asking parents to help the youngest of students through the transition, even as many are working from home.\n\nPatricia Oliveira, from Alliston, has three kids and admits she was nervous to start, but things have been doing well so far.\n\n\"I'm really impressed with the level of communication we've been getting leading up to today, preparing us and making sure we have the appropriate apps,\" she says.\n\nThe president of the Ontario Public School Boards' Association, meanwhile, has said school boards have been hearing from parents in recent weeks that they need help teaching their children at home.\n\nCathy Abraham said every board in the province has been crafting a local plan to address the needs of students who may not have access to the internet, computers or tablets, or whose parents may not have time to oversee their schooling.","388":"E3 2021 dates announced, but there's still no word about the 2020 'online experience' The cancellation of E3 2020 came as a blow to game companies and fans alike, and it also brought into question the longer-term future of the event, as game publishers made moves toward holding their own, direct-to-consumer online shows. As one industry analyst pointed out, if publishers are able to successfully reach fans directly, what's the point of having E3 in the first place?\n\nDespite that, and the uncertainties about what's going to happen over the next 12 months, the Entertainment Software Association is planning on going ahead with the show next year. As reported by Gamesindustry.biz, the ESA told partners over the weekend that E3 2021 will run June 15-17, presumably preceded by a few days of pre-E3 press conferences held by major publishers. 2021 will also be a \"reimagined\" E3, according to the report, although details on how it will be changed weren't revealed.\n\nFollowing the cancellation of E3 2020, several individual publishers, including Microsoft, Ubisoft, E3, and Devolver Digital either committed to, or said they are considering, separate online events in the absence of E3; Bethesda, unfortunately, confirmed last week that it will not hold its annual digital showcase this year.\n\nUnfortunately, the ESA did not provide any updates on its own plan for an online replacement for E3 2020. When it announced the cancellation in March, the ESA said that it was \"exploring options with our members to coordinate an online experience to showcase industry announcements and news in June 2020,\" but nothing more has been said about it.\n\nI've reached out to the ESA for more information, and will update if I receive a reply.","389":"EDITORIAL  |  'One Minnesota' steps up in crisis Government across party lines, businesses and citizens have pulled together creatively.\n\nAs confirmed COVID-19 cases mount, Minnesota has acted swiftly to both contain the outbreak and stem accompanying economic damage.\n\nMinnesotans should be proud that they have, for the most part, faced this new danger forthrightly and with little drama. Some of the actions the state has taken have become a model for other states.\n\nGov. Tim Walz was among the first to declare food supply workers as Tier 2 emergency workers, making them eligible for child care even after schools closed. That may be one reason why Minnesota's grocers are fairly well-stocked, with only spot shortages.\n\nLifting restrictions on unemployment is a lifeline for the thousands who have suddenly found themselves jobless. Department of Employment and Economic Development Commissioner Steve Grove told an editorial writer that 110,000 claims were expected by week's end. A year ago this time, that weekly figure would have been about 2,000.\n\nOn Friday, Walz enacted a badly needed executive order banning price-gouging during the pandemic. That also protects Minnesotans and can serve to quell panic-buying. Also, the uninsured now will have a special window to sign up for subsidized state health insurance.\n\nThese are the kinds of actions a state can take to protect its population. School districts are providing meals. School bus drivers are delivering them. The YMCA is providing emergency child care.\n\nThis is how a state pulls together. And yet, the pain here is real, and there are no assurances it will be short-term. That makes it all the more important to observe the limits leaders here and elsewhere are being forced to order.\n\nSenate Republicans recently challenged Walz's authority to relax unemployment insurance requirements and order business closures. We understand their frustration and worry. But this is a public health crisis. Attorney General Keith Ellison has said that so far Walz's actions all fall within his authority. Of course, legislative leaders must be part of long-term responses. But in the meantime, the paramount goal must be protecting life and health.\n\nThe public should also keep in mind that there are limits to what a state can do on its own. The lack of tests, medical equipment and protective gear is maddening and dangerous. The federal government simply must do more to partner with and assist states.\n\nMinnesota does have a couple of distinct advantages heading into this crisis. The state's health system is among the best in the country. Quick work by Mayo has resulted in additional testing capacity. More is needed, but that is a start.\n\nWalz told an editorial writer that he is in talks with Mayo on tests, 3M on masks and other companies that might help with needed medical supplies. While communication with the federal government, sadly, has been less than ideal, with too little information and too much confusion, state leaders are working together across partisan lines.\n\n\"Democratic and Republican governors alike,\" Walz said, \"are in constant contact, trading information and help.\"\n\nMinnesota also heads into this crisis with full budget reserves, thanks to the discipline and foresight of its lawmakers. That will give this state more capacity to fill in whatever cracks are left once the feds pass their response package.\n\nImmense creativity is emerging in this crisis that could serve the state well once the storm passes. Emergency workarounds today may point the way to a state that functions better and protects more of its citizens in the future.\n\nIn the meantime, cooperation, patience, kindness and caring for one another will go a long way toward bringing as many Minnesotans through this as safely as possible.","390":"EDITORIAL: HOW DO WE KNOW WHAT WE KNOW? | Tempo | Cambridge Core To send this article to your Kindle, first ensure no-reply@cambridge.org is added to your Approved Personal Document E-mail List under your Personal Document Settings on the Manage Your Content and Devices page of your Amazon account.

Mangelsdorf February 14, 2020 (received for review November 8, 2019)\n\nCaveolae are small plasma membrane invaginations that are particularly abundant in adipocytes. Caveolae are implicated in lipid uptake, but the exact mechanism is not clear. Here, we characterized the physiological function of EHD2, a protein that is found at the neck of caveolae. We established a link between higher caveolar mobility induced by EHD2 loss and increased cellular fatty acid uptake. Concurrently, lipid droplets were enlarged in various tissues of EHD2-lacking mice. Our data suggest that EHD2 controls a cell-autonomous, caveolae-dependent fatty acid uptake pathway. Notably, obese patients express only low levels of EHD2, implicating a role of EHD2-controlled caveolar dynamics in obesity.","393":"ENO regulates tomato fruit size through the floral meristem development network Fruit-size increase is one of the major changes associated with tomato domestication, and it currently represents an important objective for breeding. Regulatory mutations at the LOCULE NUMBER and FASCIATED loci, the orthologues of the Arabidopsis WUSCHEL and CLAVATA3, have mainly contributed to enlarging fruit size by altering meristem activity. Here, we identify ENO as a tomato fruit regulator, which may function by regulating WUSCHEL gene expression to restrict stem-cell proliferation in a flower-specific manner. Our findings also show that a mutation in the ENO promoter was selected during domestication to establish the background for enhancing fruit size in cultivated tomatoes, denoting that transcriptional changes in key regulators have significant effects on agronomic traits.\n\nA dramatic evolution of fruit size has accompanied the domestication and improvement of fruit-bearing crop species. In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), naturally occurring cis-regulatory mutations in the genes of the CLAVATA-WUSCHEL signaling pathway have led to a significant increase in fruit size generating enlarged meristems that lead to flowers with extra organs and bigger fruits. In this work, by combining mapping-by-sequencing and CRISPR\/Cas9 genome editing methods, we isolated EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF FLORAL ORGANS (ENO), an AP2\/ERF transcription factor which regulates floral meristem activity. Thus, the ENO gene mutation gives rise to plants that yield larger multilocular fruits due to an increased size of the floral meristem. Genetic analyses indicate that eno exhibits synergistic effects with mutations at the LOCULE NUMBER (encoding SlWUS) and FASCIATED (encoding SlCLV3) loci, two central players in the evolution of fruit size in the domestication of cultivated tomatoes. Our findings reveal that an eno mutation causes a substantial expansion of SlWUS expression domains in a flower-specific manner. In vitro binding results show that ENO is able to interact with the GGC-box cis-regulatory element within the SlWUS promoter region, suggesting that ENO directly regulates SlWUS expression domains to maintain floral stem-cell homeostasis. Furthermore, the study of natural allelic variation of the ENO locus proved that a cis-regulatory mutation in the promoter of ENO had been targeted by positive selection during the domestication process, setting up the background for significant increases in fruit locule number and fruit size in modern tomatoes.","394":"EPA's proposed transparency rule: Factors to consider, many; planets to live on, one So reads a T-shirt sold by the American Statistical Association. This pithy quip encapsulates a fundamental principle of science: Scientists rely on evidence rather than authority. Indeed, \"doubt has been considered essential to science since long before the scientific method was established in the 17th century\" (1). Scientists seek reasons for why something should be believed as true, and those reasons involve data, the methods used to collect those data, and the logic connecting those data to conclusions. All other things being equal, absent the opportunity to fully inspect the data, methods, and logical connections of a study, scientists are less able to judge the validity of conclusions or the truth of propositions drawn from a study. As many of us heard from our middle school mathematics teachers, it is important to \"show all your work.\" Generating and evaluating the scientific evidence to form conclusions about the truth of a proposition is fundamental to the work of science.\n\nNotably, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is not a scientist; it is a regulatory agency. EPA employs scientists and uses science to aid in its mission, but its primary mission is regulation and the protection of the environment and the public health, rather than simply drawing scientific conclusions. Regulatory decisions can, are, and should be informed by science. But science alone is not dispositive of regulatory decisions, and one should not conflate the role of scientists qua scientists with the role of scientists working in a regulatory process. Scientists working in a regulatory process must utilize the best information available to fulfill their charge of making decisions that benefit society, often under conditions of uncertainty.","395":"ER membranes exhibit phase behavior at sites of organelle contact Contributed by Jennifer Lippincott-Schwartz, February 6, 2020 (sent for review June 25, 2019; reviewed by Barbara Baird and Tobias Baumgart)\n\nMembrane phase behavior in cells permits transient concentration of specific proteins and lipids into dynamic nanoscopic domains. Here, we tested the existence and role of such phase behavior in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. Employing hypotonic cell swelling, we created large intracellular vesicles (LICVs) from internal organelles. ER LICVs maintained stable interorganelle contacts, with known protein tethers concentrated at the contact sites. Cooled ER LICVs underwent reversible phase separation into microscopically visible domains with different lipid order and membrane fluidity. The phase-separated domains specified sites of contact between the ER and different organelles.","396":"East LA Hospital Identifies Patient With Dementia, Reunites Her With Family LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) -- A patient with dementia who was unable to identify herself at East Los Angeles Doctors Hospital has been reunited with her family.\n\nThe patient was brought to the hospital on March 15, 2020, by the Los Angeles Fire Department after they found her asking for help at the 4400 block of Sheila Street in the City of Commerce at approximately 3 p.m.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Norwalk Station announced on Twitter that she has \"been identified and reconnected with her family.\"\n\nThe department also confirmed she is a resident of Montebello.\n\nThe hospital was attempting to reunite the patient with her family last week so she could be transferred to a safe environment, especially in light of growing concerns with COVID-19 patient surge.","397":"Easter recipe: Martha Stewart's Bunny Cookies By Jessica Yadegaran | jyadegaran@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group\n\nTwo snips of your kitchen shears transform an oblong ball of cookie dough into the cutest minimalist Easter bunny ever.

As we can't go out to eat, independent restaurants are having to find new ways to diversify in order to keep going. Clare Finney finds those who can deliver the goods - and some meals even come with the wine, music and napkins, too\n\nThis is a piece I never thought I'd write. Just two weeks ago, I'd have been the first to explain exactly why ordering in is not - cannot - be the same as going out to a restaurant. I would tell you how most chefs' meals simply can't travel, and extol restaurants' virtues of atmosphere, conviviality and hospitality. \"It's just more sociable!\" I'd cry. \"Order in and you will inevitably wind up chewing over Netflix, not even speaking to each other.\"\n\nBut fast forward a fortnight and I'm not just encouraging you to dial for sustenance, I'm writing a guide to it. Because this is a world I never thought we'd be living in.\n\nIn principle I haven't changed. I still believe restaurant meals are best enjoyed in restaurants rather than the home, where the sofa and Sex Education beckons. I still believe in a restaurant's power to strengthen the ties of friendship, or affirm relationships of old.\n\nThat they are now - rightly - closed doesn't diminish this, but it does mean finding new ways in which to harness their social and personal potential as well as their takeaway offerings. As Charlie Mellor of The Laughing Heart in London observes, \"Sometimes you need someone else to curate your evening - to provide the pasta and the wine and the playlist that, when you fall out, will help restore relations.\" It is to this end that he and other enterprising independent restaurateurs are looking to make not just the meals, but as much as possible of the experience of eating out available to take away.\n\nCue London Restaurant Resistance: a database, compiled by Mellor, of all the independent restaurants in London offering deliveries. \"There'll be a summary of what each restaurant does, written from the view of someone else in the industry. So I'll fondly describe what Snackbar London is doing, for example, and someone else will describe The Laughing Heart's offering.\"\n\nThere'll be takeaways, of course, but there'll also be meals \"that require a bit of finishing at home, so they'll come with instructions\" - adding a welcome source of distraction and (if you're isolating with people) a way of engaging with each other beyond home workouts and bored bickering.\n\nSo far, so pre-Covid 19. What makes this an unusual database for unusual times is not the meals themselves - though there are more of them, and better - but the offerings beyond that. As well as masterstock beef, aubergine and salted chilli, The Laughing Heart is offering its napkins and glasses. As well as crispy fried cauliflower, ginger salt and toasted cashew Thai-style waldorf salad - one of three courses offered currently by Pidgin London on a delivery basis - there will be wines from its acclaimed wine list. There will be - from those restaurants to whom the music matters - curated playlists for you to download for your dinner.\n\n\"As these weeks and months go by, the offerings will evolve and become more sophisticated - because this is new territory,\" says Mellor. \"We don't want to profit from everybody's unhappiness; we are trying to look after our staff and suppliers. We're in the hospitality business. We assess what people need from us right now and try to provide it.\"\n\nIn short, we don't need to wait for normality to return to support our restaurants - or to be supported by them in keeping the social parts of our brains firing.\n\n\"You could have a Skype dinner party, where you order the same pre-prepared meals in and cook and eat them together,\" says Natasha Cooke of Lupins in south London. Meals from Lupins are available through Deliveroo or their own home-delivery service, which \"provides them in such a way that you can freeze or refrigerate them and reheat them when you need\".\n\nLondoners isolating in a group of housemates or with family should look up the BBQ restaurant Prairie Fire, from where pit master Michael Gratz is vac-packing his Kansas City-style smoked meats and delivering them with beers and sides you can store. They're easily reheated - \"submerge the vac-pack of meat in a hot water bath for 20 minutes and you're ready to go\" - and if you carve them up on a serving board it makes for a sense of occasion even if there isn't one. \"Pass the pork, pass the brisket, sharing around a table - it's the sort of interaction we are all going to really need.\"\n\nOf course, the most obvious route for those looking to recreate the restaurant at home is through those established providers. In the past month Deliveroo registered almost 3,000 new UK restaurants, and launched a new campaign \"to support the restaurant sector\". Premium platform Supper, meanwhile, has had what its marketing and business development officer Kieran Cawley called, \"our craziest week\".\n\n\"So many restaurants looking for delivery, which we're trying to onboard as quickly as possible - restaurants like Hide, Yauatcha, Hakkasan,\" he lists, \"who want to maintain their high, Michelin-quality standard.\" Of these, a fair few are looking to go one step further and provide the wine themselves or, recommendations for pairing.\n\nCawley has no particular views on how to make the experience feel more \"eating out\", beyond ensuring the meals you receive are of restaurant standard. \"Our bikes are designed and customised to carry the food to you in the best way possible - better than someone on a pushbike or moped can do - and we test timings and encourage our partners to omit dishes that don't travel.\" It's something I wish Deliveroo could do more of, having ordered a fair few disappointing numbers. Some restaurants have the packaging to get round this, but in general I would avoid deep-fried food (the batter goes soggy) and noodle dishes which can stick together and go claggy.\n\n\"It's the first thing we talk about in the industry, whenever the chat turns to takeaway food: the problem of transport,\" says Mellor. \"A lot of restaurant-style food doesn't travel well.\" It's why The Laughing Heart, Leroy, Lupins and other restaurants who previously eschewed delivery services have redesigned their menus accordingly.\n\n\"The flavours are still Mediterranean, just as they have been in our restaurant - but our takeaway options - lamb and aubergine tagine with couscous; chicken cacciatore - are heartier, more family-style,\" says Cooke.\n\nBraises, curries and stews only get better with time, and can be kept warm or reheated without adverse effect to flavour and texture - so you can stagger two or three courses over an evening, just like the real restaurants do.\n\nOn the evening in which my family decide to order in, we do just that: Alex Clayton of Tasca Dali in Warwick texts us 20 minutes before delivery asking us to preheat the oven. He arrives with a platter of cold meats and cheeses and another of tortilla and croquetas, for starters, and a Spanish fish and potato braise to rest snug in the oven while we eat. We light candles, sit round the table and serve up on proper crockery.

He's got a flight simulator at home and he was just practicing and practicing.\"\n\nLuke said his son could hardly sleep the night before because he was so excited.\n\n\"When me and my wife, Tanya, went to bed he shot up and said, 'Is it time to go?' He's been looking forward to this for many days.\"\n\n\"Flying an airplane\" was part of Tyler's bucket list and GoFundMe, created by his aunt to help the family check off as many items on the list as possible, while also alleviating medical expenses.\n\nThe fundraiser caught the attention of Flair Airlines employees, who quickly set to work putting together the experience.\n\nTyler was first diagnosed with a brain tumour back in 2015.\n\n\"It was a really rough go for him, but he was a trooper and fought really well. He ended up beating it,\" said Luke.\n\nThen, just under two months ago, Tyler started having trouble closing his left eye while on a trip to Mexico.\n\n\"Because of his history, he got an MRI at the Stollery Children's Hospital.

When presenter Anushka Asthana asked her: \"How's your maths?\" Ms Morgan said: \"Oh, I'm not doing maths on air.\"\n\nHowever, Leon, 10, calmly asked for an answer. The minister laughed nervously as she responded: \"As I say, I think it's probably better that politicians don't do maths or spelling on air.\" But Leon said: \"I'm afraid I've got to press that question, actually, do you know what the answer is?\"\n\nWhen Ms Morgan declined again, he supplied it himself: five.\n\nLeon then asked a tougher question, the cube root of 1,728 minus 11.

Lewis, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, and approved February 5, 2020 (received for review November 6, 2019)\n\nConventional microfluidic methods primarily rely on fluids that behave in simple ways, like water. Yield-stress fluids are materials that behave in a complex way, dramatically transitioning between solid-like and liquid-like behavior, depending on an applied stress. We introduce embedded droplet printing -- a system for the generation and manipulation of fluid droplets within yield-stress fluids. Through the utilization of complex fluid behavior, we process droplets that are completely undisturbed by exterior fluid motion or solid boundaries and thus approach an ideal state for performing sensitive processes like pharmaceutical crystallization, which we demonstrate. The ability to controllably print and process droplets that are suspended in place is powerful and we believe has the potential to greatly impact many fluidic manipulation applications.","402":"Emergence of chromatin hierarchical loops from protein disorder and nucleosome asymmetry This article requires a subscription to view the full text. If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nInside eukaryotic cells, DNA is organized in the form of chromatin. Protein disorder is abundant both within the chromatin-building blocks -- the nucleosomes -- and the regulatory chromatin-binding proteins. Such protein disorder facilitates transient and nonspecific binding of a wide-range of proteins to the nucleosomes and favors heterogeneity of nucleosome-nucleosome interactions. Here, we reveal additional important roles of protein disorder in chromatin structure regulation: symmetry breaking of the nucleosome-building blocks, enhancement of linker DNA fluctuations, and encouragement of chromatin structural fluidity and long-range regulatory loops. More broadly, our results demonstrate that chromatin-binding proteins can remain disordered or partially disordered when binding to and stabilizing the chromatin fiber.","403":"Emiliano Sala Crash Pilot Lost Control, Flew Too Fast: UK Probe | Football News Footballer Emiliano Sala was killed when the unlicensed pilot of his plane lost control and flew too fast as he tried to avoid bad weather, British aviation investigators said on Friday. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said in its final report into the January 21, 2019 crash that the single-engine Piper Malibu aircraft suffered an in-flight break-up and plunged in to the water, north of Guernsey, upside down.\n\nThe AAIB also confirmed that pilot David Ibbotson, 59, was unlicensed to fly that particular aircraft and at night, when the tragedy occurred.\n\nHe was also operating an unlicensed commercial flight and being paid an unspecified amount for the flight, which was illegal.\n\nInvestigators said it was likely that he was affected by carbon monoxide.\n\nAn interim report also found that Sala had suffered carbon monoxide poisoning before the plane crashed and was likely unconscious when it hit the water.\n\nGeraint Herbert, Senior Inspector of Air Accidents at AAIB, said the plane was flying erratically in its last moments as the pilot tried to avoid bad weather.\n\n\"During this accident the pilot lost control of the aircraft during a turn, which we believe he was making to avoid poor weather,\" Herbert told AFP.\n\n\"After that the aircraft broke up in flight because it was manoeuvring at a speed well in excess of its maximum manoeuvring speed.\"\n\n'Not survivable'\n\nThe plane was travelling at an estimated 270 miles per hour (435 kilometres per hour) when it hit the water, said the AAIB.\n\nInvestigators said the impact was \"not survivable\".\n\nAlthough there was no single cause for the accident, said investigators, the tragedy has thrown a spotlight on lax regulation.\n\nThe 115-page report highlighted concerns over the growing use of unlicensed commercial flights, such as the one used to transport Sala, by the \"sporting world\".\n\nThe AAIB also recommended that carbon monoxide monitors be fitted as standard on all planes.\n\nThe plane, built in 1984, did not have such a monitor and it is believed that the poisoning was caused by a faulty cabin heater.\n\nHerbert said two main factors contributed to the crash.\n\n\"One was that the pilot was not experienced and qualified to fly the flight, but the other one of course was that he was probably suffering from carbon monoxide poisoning,\" he said.\n\n\"We have made a recommendation to the regulators to require the carriage of carbon monoxide detectors on aircraft such as this.\"\n\nIllegal charter flights\n\nSala had signed for Cardiff in a 17-million-euro deal completed just a few days before the crash.\n\nThe Argentinian was returning to Cardiff to take part in his first training session after saying goodbye to his teammates in northwest France.\n\nIn a statement, Cardiff City said it \"welcomed\" the report which \"raises a number of new questions which we hope will be addressed during the inquest recommencing next week\".\n\nThat inquest is due to start next Monday in Bournemouth, southern England.\n\nThe European Business Aviation Association said the tragedy and report had highlighted \"the risks of illegal charter flights\".\n\nReports in the British press have said former football agent Willie McKay said he paid for the fatal flight, but did not choose the pilot or the plane.\n\nSala's body was found several days after the crash, attached to wreckage from the plane, while Ibbotson's body was never found.","404":"Endorsements Still Touchy for Teachers' Unions in Presidential Election Season Endorsements Still Touchy for Teachers' Unions in Presidential Election Season Supporters cheer as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks at a rally at the Chicago Teachers Union headquarters, in September in his bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. -- Ashlee Rezin Garcia\/Chicago Sun-Times\/AP Members want in on decisions By Madeline Will March 23, 2020 Printer-Friendly Email Article Reprints Comments\n\nAfter complaints from members who felt shut out during the 2016 presidential primary endorsement process, the national teachers' unions vowed to better engage members in this year's process. Have they succeeded?\n\nThe stakes are high: Endorsements from the teachers' unions bring campaign cash and hefty volunteer muscle in what will likely be a bruising campaign against President Donald Trump.\n\nThe Democratic presidential-primary field has narrowed down to two people: former Vice President Joe Biden, who is currently leading in the delegate count, and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\nEarlier this month, the 3-million-member National Education Association, the largest labor union in the country, announced that it was endorsing Biden for president. In a statement, NEA said its members \"have led the recommendation process and have engaged in unprecedented fashion.\"\n\n\"Biden is the tireless advocate for public education and is the partner that students and educators need now in the White House,\" said NEA President Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda in a statement. \"Now, with so much at stake in this election, educators are determined to use their voice to propel Joe Biden to the White House.\"\n\nAnd on Sunday, the American Federation of Teachers endorsed Biden, too. In an interview before the endorsement, AFT President Randi Weingarten said the chosen candidate would have to share the AFT's values (which both Sanders and Biden do, she said), have a \"real path\" to defeating Trump in the general election, and reflect the consensus of its 1.7 million members.\n\n\"We have done so much with our members to really revamp our process,\" Weingarten said.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate and former Vice President Joe Biden speaks at the United Federation of Teachers' annual Teacher Union Day in New York in October 2019. -- Craig Ruttle\/AP\n\nAFT officials have held more than 300,000 interactions with members through town halls, presidential forums, regional meetings, and local affiliates' engagement efforts since starting the endorsement process last year, she said, as well as polled members to understand their views.\n\nThe AFT also commissioned Hart Research to do a telephone survey last week of 1,207 members who are Democratic primary voters. The survey found that 60 percent of respondents favored Biden and 30 percent favored Sanders. Three-quarters of the respondents view Biden positively, the survey found.\n\nDuring the 2016 race, both teachers' unions endorsed Hillary Clinton for president very early on -- the AFT in July 2015 and the NEA in October of that year. The decision angered many members of both unions, who felt like they had been left out of the process and wanted more consideration given to Sanders, who was in contention in 2016 as well.\n\nUnion leaders say that this time around has been different: Members have had more opportunities to get involved and voice their opinions. But some teachers say they still feel disillusioned with the endorsement process.\n\n\"This just feels like a repeat of what happened [in 2016],\" said Michelle Voelker, an 8th grade teacher in Sacramento and an NEA member. \"The rank and file were not asked who they wanted to support.\"\n\nWeighing the Choices\n\nAt the start of the campaign season, the NEA created a website where members -- and the general public -- could submit their questions for the union to pass along to the candidates during town halls and interviews. Eskelsen Garc\u00eda did video interviews with eight candidates, including with Biden and Sanders.\n\nTo make the final endorsement for the primary, the NEA PAC Council, which is made up of state representatives and the union's executive leaders, put forward a recommendation for consideration by the NEA board of directors. An NEA official said 98 percent of the PAC Council and 78 percent of the board of directors supported recommending Biden.\n\nMeanwhile, in February, before Super Tuesday's round of state primaries this month, the AFT's board of directors voted to encourage its state and local affiliates to \"support, be actively involved with, or endorse\" Biden, Sanders, or Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who later dropped out of the race.\n\nWeingarten, who then endorsed Warren in her personal capacity, said state and local union leaders appreciated the ability to make their own recommendations ahead of the national union. For example, Chicago Teachers Union President Jesse Sharkey and Vice President Stacy Davis Gates have personally endorsed Sanders, while New York City's United Federation of Teachers President Michael Mulgrew backed Biden.\n\nStill, some members felt like equal weight was not given to all the candidates.\n\n\"It was abundantly clear that even though we were being told that AFT is endorsing all three candidates, ... the push was for Warren or Biden,\" said Robin Brownfield, a retired college professor who had been a member of the union for nearly 30 years.\n\n\"I've never been very pleased with AFT's strategy regarding elections and endorsements because in all the years I and my husband have been members, we've never ever been asked what we think,\" she said. \"We'll go to meetings, he'll go to meetings [now], and be told who we're campaigning for.\"\n\nCandidates' Stances\n\nAlthough both Biden and Sanders have a good amount of support from teachers, Sanders has said that teachers are among the most common workers to give to his campaign.\n\nDylan Toth, a sophomore at Illinois State University and an \"Aspiring Educator\" member of the NEA, said he thinks Sanders' education platform is more aligned with NEA's values than Biden's plan.\n\n\"Joe Biden supports teachers, but that's about as far as his plan goes,\" he said. \"There's no real structural plan.\"\n\nSanders has promised to pay teachers a minimum of $60,000 a year, to triple Title I funding aimed at disadvantaged students, and to place significant restrictions on charter schools, including a ban on for-profit entities running the schools.\n\nBiden's education plan would also triple Title I funding, and districts would have to \"offer educators competitive salaries\" to access the expanded funds, although the plan doesn't set out a minimum salary. Biden, who has called for more accountability and transparency of charter schools, has also pledged to nominate someone with teaching experience as the U.S. secretary of education.\n\nBiden's education plan has appealed to Lisa Mikolajczyk, a high school special education teacher in Florida and an NEA member who is happy with her union's endorsement.\n\n\"He has a history of getting results,\" she said, adding that Biden's wife, Jill Biden, is an NEA member. \"Joe Biden has always been supportive of public schools, and public school teachers.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Mikolajczyk said she doesn't \"trust Bernie to follow through with anything. ... He's not willing to compromise, and you need to be willing to compromise to get things passed.\"\n\nDespite his disappointment about the NEA's pick, Toth said he sees the political advantage of the teachers' union making an endorsement early: \"If we are in good standing with Biden, we could almost be in his ear\" about education policy, he said.\n\nVol. 39, Issue 27, Page 7\n\nPublished in Print: March 25, 2020, as Endorsements Still Touchy for Unions in Election Season","405":"Entrainment of mammalian motile cilia in the brain with hydrodynamic forces Edited by Howard A. Stone, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, and approved February 14, 2020 (received for review June 12, 2019)\n\nWe determine, in multiciliated mammalian cells, conditions for oscillatory flow to entrain brain motile cilia: Hydrodynamic forces of magnitude comparable to those generated by cilia themselves are sufficient to establish coordinated dynamics. We discuss this against recent reports on Chlamydomonas algae. Hydrodynamic screening between cilia plays an important role in entrainment: Cells with fewer cilia are much more susceptible to external flows. This changes how we should think about the physical mechanism underpinning collective cilia beating: It is not trivial to extrapolate from experiments on isolated cilia to the behavior of cilia assemblies, such as in multiciliated cells. Numerical simulations of a minimal mechanistic model recapitulate, qualitatively, the key results supporting the role of hydrodynamics.","406":"Environmental reservoir dynamics predict global infection patterns and population impacts for the fungal disease white-nose syndrome Infectious diseases can have devastating effects on populations, and the ability of a pathogen to persist in the environment can amplify these impacts. Understanding how environmental pathogen reservoirs influence the number of individuals that become infected and suffer mortality is essential for disease control and prevention. We integrated disease data with population surveys to examine the influence of the environmental reservoir on disease impacts for a devastating fungal disease of bats, white-nose syndrome. We find that the extent of pathogen present in the environment predicts how many hosts become infected and suffer mortality during disease outbreaks. These results provide a target for managing contamination levels in the environment to reduce population impacts.\n\nDisease outbreaks and pathogen introductions can have significant effects on host populations, and the ability of pathogens to persist in the environment can exacerbate disease impacts by fueling sustained transmission, seasonal epidemics, and repeated spillover events. While theory suggests that the presence of an environmental reservoir increases the risk of host declines and threat of extinction, the influence of reservoir dynamics on transmission and population impacts remains poorly described. Here we show that the extent of the environmental reservoir explains broad patterns of host infection and the severity of disease impacts of a virulent pathogen. We examined reservoir and host infection dynamics and the resulting impacts of Pseudogymnoascus destructans, the fungal pathogen that causes white-nose syndrome, in 39 species of bats at 101 sites across the globe. Lower levels of pathogen in the environment consistently corresponded to delayed infection of hosts, fewer and less severe infections, and reduced population impacts. In contrast, an extensive and persistent environmental reservoir led to early and widespread infections and severe population declines. These results suggest that continental differences in the persistence or decay of P. destructans in the environment altered infection patterns in bats and influenced whether host populations were stable or experienced severe declines from this disease. Quantifying the impact of the environmental reservoir on disease dynamics can provide specific targets for reducing pathogen levels in the environment to prevent or control future epidemics.","407":"Eric Dickerson's attempt to get logo changed comes up short Retired Los Angeles Rams star running back Eric Dickerson has had repeated requests for the NFC West team to change their logo have the revealed new rebranding has gone awry.\n\nDickerson, 59, a Hall of Fame rusher and former Offensive Player of the Year with the Rams, has plastered his social media in the past several weeks first laughing at the redesign of the Rams logo and then more urgently and seriously pleading with the organization to change the decision for the facelift.

He spent all his life travelling while I spent 20 years of my life in the rag trade. My travels were short-period ones, in and out. He'd done it all, but he still went on. A marvellous man.\n\nHe was very imposing. Huge, like a gigantic schoolboy, he used to wear these fantastic elegant tweed suits which he'd worn at Eton. He was an Etonian to the last.\n\nI once met him in Piccadilly outside the Ritz, just by chance. He was wearing a bowler hat, and a stiff white collar and a double-breasted waistcoast. He looked almost dandyish. He had asked me to come to Ethiopia with him, and my wife, who was with me, said she wanted to come too. \"Yes,\" said Thesiger, \"I don't mind taking you. I believe there's a slave market where we're going.\"\n\nHe didn't really like women terribly. He had one or two special ones whom he got on with well. But he would have consigned my wife to this slave market I'm sure if he'd had the opportunity.\n\nAnd he disliked Evelyn Waugh intensely. Waugh had written his parody Black Mischief based on experiences in Ethiopia and made fun of Thesiger's father, who was a minister in Addis Ababa. Later Waugh had asked to accompany Thesiger into the Danakil country. He later told me: \"If we'd gone in there together, only one of us would have come back.\" I'm sure he meant it.\n\nMy first meeting with Thesiger was in the Hindu Kush. We came down into a junction in the Panjshir river. We'd been travelling all day, and all night, crossing a very wild pass. \"Look,\" said Hugh, my companion, \"it must be Thesiger.\"\n\nThesiger's horses lurched to a standstill on the execrable track. They were deep-loaded with great wooden presses, marked \"British Museum\", and black tin trunks.\n\nThe party consisted of two villainous-looking tribesmen dressed like royal mourners in long overcoats reaching to the ankles; a shivering Tajik cook, to whom some strange mutation had given bright red hair, unsuitably dressed for central Asia in crippling pointed brown shoes and natty socks supported by suspenders, but no trousers; the interpreter, a gloomy-looking middle-class Afghan in a coma of fatigue, wearing dark glasses, a double-breasted lounge suit and an American hat with stitching all over it; and Thesiger himself, a great, long-striding crag of a man, with an outcrop for a nose and bushy eyebrows, 45 years old and as hard as nails, in an old tweed jacket, a pair of thin grey cotton trousers, rope-soled Persian slippers and a woollen cap comforter.\n\n\"Turn round,\" he said, \"you'll stay the night with us. We're going to kill some chickens.\"\n\nWe tried to explain that we had to get to Kabul but our men, who professed to understand no English but were reluctant to pass through the gorges at night, had already turned the horses and were making for the collection of miserable hovels that was the nearest village.\n\nSoon we were sitting under some mulberry trees, surrounded by the entire population, with all Thesiger's belongings piled up behind us.\"Can't speak a word of the language,\" he said cheerfully. \"Know a lot of the Koran by heart but not a word of Persian. Still, it's not really necessary. Here, you,\" he shouted at the cook, who had only entered his service the day before and had never seen another Englishman. \"Make some green tea and a lot of chicken and rice - three chickens.\" After two hours the chickens arrived; they were like elastic, only the rice and gravy were delicious. Famished, we wrestled with the bones in the darkness.\n\n\"England's going to pot,\" said Thesiger, as Hugh and I lay smoking the interpreter's king-size cigarettes, the first for a fortnight. \"Look at this shirt, I've only had it three years, now it's splitting. Same with tailors; Gull and Croke made me a pair of whipcord trousers to go to the Atlas Mountains. Sixteen guineas - wore a hole in them in a fortnight. Bought half a dozen shotguns to give to my headmen, well-known make, 20 guineas apiece, absolute rubbish.\"\n\nThe ground was like iron with sharp rocks sticking up out of it. We started to blow up our air beds. \"God, you must be a couple of pansies,\" said Thesiger.","409":"Eric Staal not with Wild as team opens three-game road trip vs. Sharks SAN JOSE - The Wild opens a three-game road trip Thursday in San Jose against the Sharks without Eric Staal, the team's third-leading goal scorer.\n\nThe veteran center did not accompany the team to California due to a death in his family. It's unclear whether Staal will rejoin the team at some point on the trip, which also has stops in Los Angeles (Saturday) and Anaheim (Sunday).\n\nWith Staal unavailable, the Wild will shift Luke Kunin to center after he returned to the lineup Tuesday from an upper-body injury at right wing. Before Kunin got hurt, he was playing up the middle.\n\nGerald Mayhew will draw in at wing, and Victor Rask will remain scratched. Goalie Alex Stalock will make a sixth straight start.\n\n\"We felt very comfortable with Luke at either position,\" interim coach Dean Evason said. \"We've got a lot of different options. Even within the game, we're going to be able to flip people around if need be.\"\n\nThis is the Wild's first trip back to San Jose since a 6-5 loss on Nov.7, a game in which the Wild fell into a 4-0 hole early and nearly rallied to win.\n\nThat game was part of an early-season swoon on the road, but the team has since rebounded.\n\nOver its last 22 road games, the Wild is 13-7-2 as the visitor and has scored three or more goals in 17 of those contests.\n\n\"I think our group feels good about each other,\" Evason said. \"That's the main thing.

With 5G now a commercial reality, the ability to effectively collect, analyze and autonomously act on real-time data is a catalyst towards making the digital economy a reality. Ericsson is making it happen, where AI is nothing new to a company that has been developing and embedding it in their solutions for more than 10 years.\n\nAcross industries, AI is being used in all manner of ways to increase operational efficiencies, lower costs and improve customer experience. Just use a media streaming platform such as Spotify and Netflix and you can see AI in action, as the algorithms analyze your user behavior, and that of people with similar behavior, to recommend new TV shows, films, and music. But these examples, impressive as they are, solve simple use cases with simple AI algorithms.\n\nWhat is AI doing in more complex industries, with more complex challenges and use cases to solve, where much more is at stake? The financial sector is one that comes to mind, transportation another. But perhaps more complex than both of these: communications. Connecting everyone, connecting everything, everywhere, at any time, on demand, is an enormously complex task, with equally complex infrastructure and technology. AI helps to solve the challenges along the way, but it doesn't do so with one broad, general brush. There is no one-size-fits-all general AI that will solve all problems.\n\nCUSTOMER FOCUSED\n\nElena Fersman, Director of Artificial Intelligence at Ericsson Research, says the company's approach to AI is specifically focused on solving the challenges of its customers and the telecommunications industry for many years.\n\n\"Our AI does not power talking cylinders, create art experiments, label photos or recommend movies and music. It is not a general-purpose tool intended for any use case imaginable, and we don't have brand teams think of cute names for it...we aren't interested in any of that,\" Fersman says. \"At Ericsson, we have been working with AI for more than a decade and take a different approach. We develop AI to solve the right problems: the right problems for our customers, and not problems outside of those. We are embedding AI deeply throughout our portfolio and services specific to use cases that can scale to all our customers.\"\n\n\"Because of this approach, we don't sell or market AI as a solution in itself. It comes with what we offer, as standard. I think, perhaps, this has led to a perception that in some way we may not have been associated with AI in the same way as companies who focus only on AI. But for the specific needs that we focus on, our AI expertise and leadership is unsurpassed. We have proven focused industry expertise in AI, so in that sense we are an AI company.\"\n\nSIX CHALLENGES\n\nIt's with this laser focus on solving the right problems, not all problems, that Ericsson has identified six specific challenges for communications service providers that, when addressed with AI-embedded solutions, add significant value:\n\nEnsure network performance Improve energy efficiency and meet sustainability demands Turn operations into an efficient business enabler Realize the value from cloud and a virtualized core Create an outstanding, future-proof customer (user) experience Bring out the most from existing infrastructure\n\n\"Focusing on these six specific challenges for our customers allows us to be very concentrated when developing and embedding AI solutions that truly add value,\" Fersman says. \"For example, to improve energy efficiency and meet demands of sustainability, we have developed and embedded an AI solution for automated MIMO sleep in radio base stations that provides 14 percent energy savings when turned on.\"\n\n\"When we focus on turning operations into an efficient business enabler, one solution within our Managed Services Offering - the Ericsson Operations Engine - is able to predict KPI degradation in the Radio Access Network, and now more than 70 percent of KPI degradation incidents are prevented with data-driven operations.\"\n\n\"The fact is, for each one of these six specific challenges, we have multiple live AI solutions operating in live networks for our customers that are already adding real value, whether through minimizing costs, reducing incidents, increasing efficiencies, curbing energy consumption, or improving user experience. The list goes on and it is something that I am very proud about.\"\n\nTHE FUTURE\n\nSo, what does the future of AI look like at Ericsson? Fersman says it's about solving complex problems now, and a broadening AI mind in the future. \"The more complex problems that we can solve now with real and tangible value for our customers, the more that will add to a broader AI implementation across our portfolio as we increasingly make these AI-powered solutions work holistically across the network,\" Fersman says. \"Imagine networks that run themselves, optimize themselves, solve problems autonomously.

These skills always work hand-in-hand, close to customer problems, and collaborating to solve them. This means that we know what the right problems to solve are, how to solve them and what a good solution looks like.\"\n\nQ: And what about AI-ready technology?\n\nFersman: \"Ericsson's technology is AI-ready - from RAN, to centralized clouds, core and operations - to customer-facing areas such as BSS and customer analytics. We have made architectural decisions that make AI easy to deploy holistically across the network. Combined with our telecom domain expertise, this means we can use AI where it makes sense, solving the right problems for our customers.\"\n\nQ: Tell us more about Ericsson's approach to AI use case co-creation.\n\nFersman: \"We have learned through experience that co-creation - developing solutions together across competence areas with our customers - is critical. We develop our AI in the field together with our customers with real network data, leveraging our domain expertise and a portfolio of ready-made use cases and pre-trained algorithms that we adapt to various customer contexts and problems. This way we can solve the right problems for our customers, instead of providing an untrained general platform or solutions that only solve very specific challenges.\"\n\nQ: What access to data does Ericsson have that is unique in terms of AI development for the telecommunications industry?\n\nFersman: \"We have a deeper level of access to data than communications service providers for training our algorithms. Since we support and monitor our networks, we get access to very valuable data that is perfectly suitable for AI development, and when complemented with unique access to a wide variety of operational data through our Managed Services offering, we can develop algorithms that are more powerful than those offered by other players in the industry.\"\n\nQ: Please tell us more about Ericsson's AI-powered portfolio.\n\nFersman: \"We are not a niche player, focusing on one use case. Instead, we build AI into every part of our portfolio where it makes sense, all the way from baseband to centralized clouds. With AI spread out through all of our products, we can see the whole end-to-end context and how we make every part of the network function together. Our portfolio also comes with AI embedded - it is built straight into our products and ready to be turned on.\"","411":"Ericsson Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC On March 19, 2020, Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) filed its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2019 with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nThe Annual Report is available on Ericsson's website at https:\/\/www.ericsson.com\/en\/investors.

If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nDirect measurement of protein diffusion at a solid-liquid interface, unlike that in a bulk liquid phase, is challenging, particularly in complex adsorbent geometries. As a result there is disagreement as to whether surface diffusion contributes significantly to protein transport into porous ion-exchange chromatography (IEX) beads. We provide complementary evidence supporting the role of surface diffusion in protein transport into IEX media and show that the diffusivity depends explicitly on adsorption affinity. Exploiting this relationship, we further present an innovative procedure for loading protein onto a column that increases the column productivity by 43% for purification of a monoclonal antibody. We therefore provide a multipronged approach for investigating protein surface diffusion and validate its significance in protein transport.","415":"Ethical behavior for birders and photographers People who photograph birds should know the name of the bird in the photo. At least, they should be able to use a bird identification book to get the name. At least, they should own a bird identification book.\n\nI am a photographer of birds. I was a birder first, for years before digital cameras created a new photographic world. Birder first means you are likely to bring knowledge of and respect for the animal (and other observers) into the field with you. Birders learn that from exposure to the at-large birding community.\n\nMany photographers lack that background. Still, most are respectful of the birds and other people in the field, with or without camera. There are photographers, however, who have forgotten the lessons of courtesy we all learned in kindergarten. I have encountered photographers who are simply rude to both birds and people.\n\nThere is a code of ethics for birders. It puts the best interests of the bird first. All who engage with birds need to act ethically. Photographers should use the guidelines written for birders. While ethical behavior is a given for most photographers, it would cramp the style of others. Those bozos, unfortunately, are not animals threatened with survival, as many bird species are.\n\nAll of us should know ethical-behavior guidelines.

As the British public went to cast their ballots in the European elections amid ongoing strife over Brexit, Eurovision said that due to \"an incorrect calculation\" on the night, the score for Michael Rice's entry, Bigger Than Us, had been lowered from a 16 to 11.\n\nThe decision added fuel to a campaign for the UK to quit Eurovision. Even before the competition, the pro-Brexit Daily Express reported that a YouGov poll had found Britain as split over Eurovision as over membership of the EU itself: 52% wanted to leave the competition, while 48% wanted to keep competing.\n\nTelevision presenter Lorraine Kelly - considered an expert on matters Eurovision - said on her show: \"I think it's time to leave because it's embarrassing ... I've just had enough of it - it's too political and too silly.\"\n\nRice himself blamed Brexit: \"I always knew I was going to come in this position because of Brexit. Do you know what? If it was Gary Barlow or Elton John, they still probably would have come last too.\"\n\nAnd once again, the UK occupied the dreaded bottom rung on the scoreboard - the fourth time in 16 years. But as one of the Eurovision Big Five, the UK contributes a considerable amount of funding to the event - \u00a3310,000, according to the most recent figures available, from 2012. Is it money well spent, or is the UK being short-changed? Let's look at an example of a country that decided to quit, and see if it is worth it.\n\nDissatisfaction with the voting rules was one of Turkey's main reasons for withdrawing ahead of the contest in 2013. But there was also a general feeling in Turkey - which paid a considerable sum to participate in Eurovision - that the nation should be in the Big Five with an automatic place in the final.\n\nTurkey's complaint was that it hadn't been consulted over the European Broadcasting Union's decision to reintroduce its system of split voting between national juries and the general public. Despite doing comparatively well under the new rules - coming second in 2010 and achieving a respectable seventh place in 2012 - it left.\n\nIn 2013 and 2014, the event wasn't even broadcast in Turkey: according to state broadcaster TRT the low ratings of the spectacle did not warrant the fee. Yet given that 25% of Turkish households tuned in to watch the 2012 show, this sounded a bit contrived, and some suspected that a same-sex kiss during Finland's rehearsals may have played a part in the decision.\n\nChance to shine\n\nEurovision offers a priceless opportunity to showcase local culture and generate interest - especially important for a country with a large tourism economy such as Turkey. Appealing to a European audience, and marketing themselves as being part of Europe - culturally and politically - were among the reasons behind Turkey's decision to first enter Eurovision in the 1970s.\n\nWhile it often scored poorly to begin with, continued participation paid off and from the late 1990s onwards, Turkey established itself as a top contender, showcasing a diverse musical and visual culture and even winning in 2003.\n\nOne of the main things Eurovision promotes is a sense inclusivity and tolerance. Austria's 2014 winner Conchita Wurst, who performed in a dress and full beard, is now an international star. The competition's campness has long made it popular among LGBTQ+ fans across Europe and much of the rest of the world - but TRT seems to have taken offence. Ibrahim Eren (the General Director of TRT) commented in 2018 that Turkey \"cannot broadcast live at 9pm, when children are still awake, an Austrian with a beard and a skirt, who claims not to have a gender and says, 'I am a man and a woman at the same time'.\"\n\nThis attitude is, perhaps, a bigger hurdle than the voting system and the fees put together. Queerness is part of the DNA of Eurovision, and true fans of the competition celebrate that. There's an enduring sense that this may be the main reason that Turkey remains outside the Eurovision fold. But now that Eren has been elected to the European Broadcasting Union's executive board, the chance of a return may have increased.\n\nThe UK, meanwhile, was named Europe's most LGBT-friendly country in 2014 and 2015. And what better platform on which to showcase these values to the world, than Eurovision?\n\nNo one likes a sore loser. Britain has hardly endeared itself to Europe over the past three years. As the Brexit debate has raged, anti-EU slogans from British Brexiteers have resounded around the continent. All the sulking over poor scores in Eurovision has hardly helped.\n\nSurely now, when ties to Europe are under considerable strain, the only approach that could benefit the UK would be to use the contemporary songwriting skills and artistry that contribute a record \u00a34.5 billion to the nation's economy, to come back with a bang in 2020.","417":"Evaluating the evaluation of cancer driver genes The search for genetic drivers of cancer has rapidly progressed with systematic exome-sequencing studies (1). A major goal of these studies is to identify signals of positive selection and distinguish them from passenger mutations. A cancer driver gene is defined as one whose mutations increase net cell growth under the specific microenvironmental conditions that exist in the cell in vivo. The total number of driver genes is unknown, but we assume that is considerably less than 19,000. At present, the only way to assess the evidence for a gene being a driver gene in vivo in humans is through evaluation of the mutations present in clonal expansions of tumor cells. Because passenger gene mutations will also be fixed in any cell that expands due to a driver gene mutation, statistical evaluation in patient cohorts is required to distinguish the two. The first exomic analyses attempted to identify candidate driver genes as those having more mutations than expected from some presumed background somatic mutation rate, corrected for base context, gene size, and other variables (2, 3). Subsequent work has considerably refined the variables involved in determining whether a gene is more mutated in cancers than expected by chance. This has led to a variety of \"significantly mutated gene\" methods that adjust for covariates such as replication timing and gene expression as well as including more sophisticated metrics of mutational base contexts (4, 5).\n\nAn alternative approach to finding cancer drivers employs ratiometric methods. Rather than attempting to determine whether the observed mutation rate of a gene in cancers is higher than expected by chance, these methods simply assess the composition of mutations normalized by the total mutations in a gene. The ratiometric 20\/20 rule (6) evaluates the proportion of inactivating mutation and recurrent missense mutations in a gene of interest. Other ratiometric approaches use mutation functional impact bias (7), mutational clustering patterns (8, 9), or mutation composition patterns (9). Here, we describe a machine-learning-based, ratiometric method (20\/20+) that formalizes and extends the original 20\/20 rule and enables automated integration of multiple features of positive selection.\n\nRigorous and unbiased evaluation is necessary to inform users about the comparative utility of prediction methods, including the method described herein. In many investigative domains, there is a generally accepted gold standard against which predictions can be benchmarked. However, only a limited number of genes have been fully vetted as cancer drivers. In previous work, driver prediction has been benchmarked by significant overlap with the Cancer Gene Census (CGC) (10), which is a manually curated list of likely but not necessarily validated driver genes (7, 8) or by agreement with a consensus gene list of drivers predicted by multiple methods (11). To our knowledge, a systematic framework for the evaluation of somatic mutations that can be generally applied has not been previously developed.\n\nIn this work, we present a framework for such evaluations. The framework has five components, some of which have been previously applied in isolation, but not as part of a unified system. We considered overlap with CGC, agreement between methods, comparison of observed vs. theoretical P values, number of significant genes predicted, and prediction consistency on independent partitions of the dataset. To implement this framework, we first collected 729,205 published somatic mutations from 34 cancer types (9, 12) (Fig. S1). These mutations were composed of single base substitutions and in-frame and out-of-frame insertions and deletions (indels) of less than 10 bp. We then compared various methods on the full pancancer set and on four selected cancer types with diverse mutation rates -- pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC), breast adenocarcinoma (BRAC), head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD).","418":"Evaluation of a concerted vs. sequential oxygen activation mechanism in \u03b1-ketoglutarate-dependent nonheme ferrous enzymes This article requires a subscription to view the full text. If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nMany iron-dependent enzymes utilize molecular oxygen to functionalize inert C-H bonds in biology. Nonheme ferrous enzymes perform these reactions by reducing dioxygen, often in the presence of a sacrificial electron donor, to form a reactive intermediate that converts substrate to product. In \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1KG)-dependent enzymes, there has been discussion on the necessity of substrate prebinding to the \u03b1KG-bound ferrous center for productive chemistry. This study demonstrates that, when substrate is not prebound to the enzyme, the species generated in the reaction with dioxygen is not competent to perform hydrogen atom abstraction from the substrate. In contrast, when both cosubstrates are prebound to the enzyme, efficient coupling between dioxygen reduction and substrate oxidation is observed, leading to productive chemistry.","419":"Even Spider-Man Won't Be Enough to Save PS Now A recent leak makes it seem like PlayStation Now is about to get access to Insomniac's Spider-Man.\n\nPS Now is one of several high-profile game streaming services. It might be one of the longest-running ones since it originally came out back in 2014. But it's struggled to find the success of similar competing services such as Xbox Game Pass, which doesn't even offer streaming.\n\nA new leak makes it seem likely that PS Now is about to get a pretty significant upgrade. Insomnia's Spider-Man might be making its way to the service if a recently leaked ad is to be believed. If this is true, even Spider-Man can't save it all on his own.\n\nMany streaming services are currently suffering from accessibility issues. Whether it's the cost of investment or equipment requirements, many streaming services are just not worth the price of admission.\n\nPS Now is no exception. It costs around $10 a month to subscribe to the service. You're also going to need a fast enough internet connection to use it. Plus, if you want the online features, then you'll still have to fork out for PS+.\n\nIt's the same story with Google Stadia. Right now, it still requires you to buy a founders edition running over $100 and requires a similarly beefy internet.\n\nGame Pass succeeds because you can buy Ultimate for $14.99 a month. It rolls together Xbox Live, Game Pass, and Game Pass PC. All of that and you don't even need an impressive internet connection to use it. It's just way more accessible.\n\nFor PS Now to become a truly impressive service, it needs to copy Game Pass just a little. For starters, offering the ability to download games to play, as well as streaming them, would make it easier for players on worse internet connections.\n\nAlso, offering a combo deal with PS Now and PS+ for a competitive rate might also help people to give the streaming service a try.\n\nIt's not that PlayStation needs to copy Xbox to be successful. Hell, they dominated this previous console generation fine without doing that. But, if they want to offer the best services and deals they can to their players, then they should look at what their competitors are doing right.","420":"Even bush knew pandemics were a real thing back in 2005...

If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nSystemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease characterized by pathogenic autoantibodies. CD4T cells are involved, but the identity of the pathogenic B helper T cells is unclear. Notably, the antiinflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) might promote autoantibody production in SLE. Here, we identified a T cell population that expressed CCR6 and promoted antibody production in a partially IL-10-dependent manner. These CCR6T cells were distinct from previously identified B helper T cells and expanded in mice developing lupus-like disease and in SLE patients, where they spontaneously induced autoantibodies. They were abundant in lymph nodes of SLE patients, but were excluded from B cell follicles. These findings suggest that extrafollicular, IL-10-producing CCR6T cells play a pathogenic role in SLE.","422":"Evidence for habitual climbing in a Pleistocene hominin in South Africa Edited by Richard G. Klein, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, and approved February 18, 2020 (received for review August 20, 2019)\n\nHere we present evidence of hominin locomotor behavior from the trabecular bone of the femur. We show evidence for habitual use of highly flexed hip postures, which could potentially indicate regular climbing in a South African hominin from Sterkfontein, which is either Paranthropus robustus or Homo. Second, we present evidence that Australopithecus africanus likely did not climb at the frequencies seen in extant nonhuman apes, and exhibits a modern, human-like pattern of loading at the hip joint. These results challenge the prevailing view of a single transition to bipedalism within the hominin clade by providing evidence of climbing in a more recent, non-Australopithecus South African hominin, and add to the increasing evidence for locomotor diversity in the hominin clade.","423":"Evolution of dispersal in a spatially heterogeneous population with finite patch sizes Edited by Alan Hastings, University of California, Davis, CA, and approved February 18, 2020 (received for review September 12, 2019)\n\nOrganisms are known to invest resources to disperse their offspring. Plants produce fruits, although fruit eaters do not promise to disperse seeds to the right places. According to a classical theory, costly dispersal can evolve because dispersing individuals can avoid competition among their own offspring. The textbook formulas of evolutionary stable dispersal strategies, however, assume the same living conditions everywhere. Here we present formulas predicting the dispersal probability in spatially heterogeneous environments. In the real world, no environment is homogeneous as assumed in the classical theory, so our results bring in important achievements. In heterogeneous environments the evolved dispersal probability can be much lower than in homogeneous ones, and also diversification in dispersal strategies is possible.","424":"Evolution of hyperossification expands skull diversity in frogs Edited by Neil H. Shubin, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, and approved February 28, 2020 (received for review January 16, 2020)\n\nThe vertebrate head is an integrated system essential for sensory functions, capturing prey, and defense mechanisms. Head anatomy has long attracted the attention of biologists, yet identifying the factors responsible for the evolution of deviant morphological forms has remained a long-standing challenge. Frogs are one of the most diverse vertebrate orders but have not been thoroughly studied with respect to cranial morphological variation. We use extensive sampling of all major lineages to quantify skull diversity, reconstruct the evolution of increased mineralization (hyperossification), and test for relationships between ecology, skull shape, and hyperossification. We find that several extreme skull shapes have repeatedly evolved in frogs, hyperossification has arisen independently many times, and deviant skulls often cooccur with hyperossification and specialized functions.","425":"Ex-Panthers QB Cam Newton Says He's in 'Unchartered Waters' Amid Free Agency Cam Newton is still looking for a new home after he was cut by the Carolina Panthers earlier this offseason, and he's not entirely sure how to go about it.\n\nSpeaking on Instagram Live with Chris Paul on Monday, the 2011 No. 1 overall pick called himself a \"fish out of water\" and said he's still working on getting better.\n\nNewton's tenure with Carolina ended as new head coach Matt Rhule took over for Ron Rivera and the team added quarterback Teddy Bridgewater on a three-year deal, rendering Newton unnecessary for the Panthers moving forward.","426":"Exclusive: 90 Day Fiance's Jorge Nava Reveals How Much Weight He Lost Behind Bars In an interview conducted by his lawyer, Brad Rideout, for In Touch, Nava discusses how incredible it feels to be \"healthy,\" admitting he's been exercising with his cellmates. \"Yeah, I actually started working out with other people that have been training and doing bodybuilding and stuff,\" the season 4 star tells In Touch via the managing partner and attorney-at-law at Rideout Law Group. \"So, I have pretty good coaches in here.\"\n\nNava reveals he often tries a myriad of diets, after hitting a plateau and stopped losing weight.

This all started about five years ago when one of our past clients asked us to buy him a new $20k chimney, claiming we had missed a major issue with the chimney.\n\nThis was a 1920s two-story stucco home with a stucco-covered chimney at the front of the house. The upper portion of the chimney had been recently worked on, and it all looked very good.\n\nComing down the chimney, however, there were a few cracks and damaged areas in the stucco covering that would obviously admit water.\n\nWe took photos of the cracks, we put these photos in our home inspection report, and we recommended having the stucco repaired.\n\nThis house had a lot of serious issues, and the stucco damage at the chimney was probably one of the least concerns for our client, so nothing was done about it for a while. Our client purchased the home, and eventually had a stucco contractor come out to see about fixing the damaged stucco at the chimney. This was about six months after taking possession of the home.\n\nThe stucco contractor who came out told our client that the stucco couldn't be repaired, because the chimney was falling apart behind the stucco. What our client needed, apparently, was a complete chimney tear-down and rebuild. Our client contacted a few different chimney contractors for bids, and those bids were all in the neighborhood of $20k to rebuild the chimney.\n\nOuch. The worst part was that one of these contractors told him that his home inspector should have caught this. They told him that all stucco-covered chimneys of this age are falling apart and will be expensive to rebuild, and we should have known this.\n\nSide note: If there's one phrase that drives me bananas more than anything else, it's \"your home inspector should have...\"\n\nIf you're not a home inspector and you weren't at the inspection, then don't say something like that. That's surely not a phrase you're qualified to make.\n\nSo that's when he called me. I followed up with a few of my own contractors to discuss the repair options and to learn more about stucco-covered chimneys. They agreed that these chimneys, typically found on homes built in the 1920s and 1930s, can be problematic. They're not all bad, but when they start to fall apart, it's an expensive project.\n\nThe issue with these old stucco-covered chimneys is that they were typically built with sand-lime bricks that don't hold up over time when exposed to water. The stucco walls were supposed to protect the bricks, but once you have chimneys leaking water from the top, that water starts to destroy the chimney on the inside. It takes a long time for this to happen, but these chimneys were built a long time ago. That brings us to present-day, where we're starting to see the results of this damage throughout the Twin Cities.\n\nThe chimneys we're looking out for are stucco-covered chimneys on homes built during the 1920s and 1930s. The photos below show some examples of these chimneys.\n\nFor this first one, the upper portion of the chimney was rebuilt with concrete blocks.\n\nThis next one, which we like to call a Neopolitan chimney, also had some repairs completed. These repairs were only temporary.\n\nThis next chimney will be needing repairs very soon.\n\nAnd I don't think the rest of these stucco-covered chimneys need any explanation.\n\nIf a stucco-covered chimney is in pristine condition and there are no signs of water intrusion, wonderful. We're good. But when a stucco-covered chimney shows signs of past water intrusion, experience has taught us that these issues can be expensive.","429":"Experimental constraints on subglacial rock friction | Annals of Glaciology | Cambridge Core Subglacial rock friction is an important control on the sliding dynamics and erosive potential of hard-bedded glaciers, yet it remains largely unconstrained. To explore the relative influence of basal melt rate, effective stress and ice temperature on frictional resistance, we conducted abrasion experiments in which limestone beds were slid beneath a fixed slab of ice laden with granitic rock fragments. Shear stress scales linearly with melt rate and cryostatic stress, confirming that both viscous drag and effective stress are first-order controls on the contact force in drained conditions. Furthermore, temperature gradients in the ice increase the contribution of viscous drag on basal shear stress. In all experiments, the relationship between melt rate and shear stress is best explained by a model that accounts for the effects of regelation and viscous creep on the bed-normal drag force. We interpret this to mean fluid flow around entrained clasts contributed to basal drag even at subfreezing temperatures. Incorporating premelting dynamics into the Watts\/Hallet model for subglacial rock friction, we find that the predicted debris-bed drag decreases by approximately an order of magnitude, with a corresponding ~3.5 \u00d7 increase in the transition radius. This is lower than we observe for ice slightly below the pressure melting point.","430":"Exploring long-range cooperativity in the 20S proteasome core particle from Thermoplasma acidophilum using methyl-TROSY-based NMR The proteasome is a molecular machine that plays a key role in maintaining the healthy function of cells through eliminating protein molecules that are no longer required or that are damaged. Proteasome function is, in part, regulated through the binding of other protein components that turn on pathways of communication between the sites of binding and distal regions of the proteasome that are responsible for its catalytic activity. Understanding how information is communicated between far-removed sites in the proteasome, and the extent of the pathway of communication, is a key first step in the design of molecules that can regulate its activity, with potentially important implications in the fight against certain cancers and neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nThe 20S core particle (CP) proteasome is a molecular assembly catalyzing the degradation of misfolded proteins or proteins no longer required for function. It is composed of four stacked heptameric rings that form a barrel-like structure, sequestering proteolytic sites inside its lumen. Proteasome function is regulated by gates derived from the termini of \u03b1-rings and through binding of regulatory particles (RPs) to one or both ends of the barrel. The CP is dynamic, with an extensive allosteric pathway extending from one end of the molecule to catalytic sites in its center. Here, using methyl-transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY)-based NMR optimized for studies of high-molecular-weight complexes, we evaluate whether the pathway extends over the entire 150-\u00c5 length of the molecule. By exploiting a number of different labeling schemes, the two halves of the molecule can be distinguished, so that the effects of 11S RP binding, or the introduction of gate or allosteric pathway mutations at one end of the barrel can be evaluated at the distal end. Our results establish that while 11S binding and the introduction of key mutations affect each half of the CP allosterically, they do not further couple opposite ends of the molecule. This may have implications for the function of so-called \"hybrid\" proteasomes where each end of the CP is bound with a different regulator, allowing the CP to be responsive to both RPs simultaneously. The methodology presented introduces a general NMR strategy for dissecting pathways of communication in homo-oligomeric molecular machines.","431":"Extreme mechanical resilience of self-assembled nanolabyrinthine materials This article requires a subscription to view the full text.

Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nNano- and microarchitected materials to date have relied on additive manufacturing techniques to produce beam-, plate-, and shell-based architectures that achieve highly desired mechanical properties while being limited to low-throughput volumes as well as to periodic and symmetric designs that deteriorate if symmetry-breaking defects are present. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of nano-architected materials via scalable self-assembly processes with features that span across multiple scales -- from nanometers to centimeters. Through experiments and simulations, we show that the smooth, doubly curved, shell-based geometries achieved through this process can surpass truss-based architectures in terms of energy absorption, stiffness-to-density response, and especially, mechanical resilience through an unprecedented combination of material size effects and optimal topology.","432":"Eye movements shape visual learning This article requires a subscription to view the full text.

We therefore hypothesized that eye movements influence learning in the context of noisy or complicated stimulus patterns. Observers practiced a task in which noisy visual signals were presented during a saccade. Under these conditions, most observers integrated these signals in a manner that was dictated by the eye movement direction. Surprisingly, observers who exhibited this tendency to integrate during saccades learned, through extensive training, to perform the same integration in the absence of eye movements. These results suggest that eye movements can shape the way in which people learn to extract meaningful information from challenging visual stimuli.","433":"Ezra Miller Appears to Choke Woman at a Bar in Scary New Video Ezra Miller may be in quite a lot of trouble with the law.\n\nAnd with the public in general as well.\n\nIn an Internet that emerged online Sunday night and quickly went viral, the actor appears to choke at a bar in Reykjavik, Iceland.\n\nConfused reigned on social media in the aftermath of the footage, with many users believing it was a prank or a fake.\n\nHowever, a source at the establishment, Priki\u00f0 Kaffih\u00fas, has confirmed to Variety that this most definitely was a serious altercation at the bar -- and that the man whom they identify as Miller, was escorted off the premises.\n\nMiller is best known for having played The Flash in Justice League, and is scheduled to anchor a film based around that DC Comics character in 2022.\n\nIn this frightening clip, which you can find on Twitter, the star seeminly shouts at a woman:\n\n\"Did you want to fight?

In an event organised by the Local Organising Committee for the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup India 2020, current and former players were seen inspiring the future. Former Indian Women's Team Captain and Padma Shri Bembem Devi, and current captain Ashalata Devi were amongst those who interacted with the India U-17 Women's squad and more than 100 girls from schools and NGOs around Goa.\n\nBembem Devi and Ashalata Devi too shared their experiences with the U-17 squad who are likely to be amongst the first Indian female players to take part in a FIFA Tournament, as well as with the other attendees.\n\n\"It is very heartening to see everyone out here today to celebrate International Women's Day and Indian women's football. It is clear today and very encouraging that the game has been on the rise since I started playing. I am sure that the whole nation will rally around and support the team in November when they take the field and they will then prove to be inspirations for the next set of kids who will choose to take up the game. The future definitely looks bright for women's football in the country,\" said Ashalata Devi.\n\nOne of the highlights of the day was to see Precious Dede, India's U-17 goalkeeping coach and four- time FIFA Women's World Cup participant with Nigeria, give a goalkeeping masterclass to the attending NGO and school children.\n\nLOC Tournament Director Roma Khanna said, \"With India hosting the FIFA U- 17 Women's World Cup later this year, we wanted the girls to get a glimpse of what it takes to be a professional footballer.

It's ambitious, but a cluttered weeper whose lessons might have stuck, had there been fewer of them.\n\nPepper (Jakob Salvati) grows up during World War II, and has to send his best friend, his \"partner,\" his dad (Michael Rapaport) into combat in the Pacific. The teen brother (David Henrie) who didn't qualify for service makes sure that Pepper, derisively nicknamed \"Little Boy\" by one and all, knows who to hate. Their nickname starts with a \"J\" and ends with an \"ap.\"\n\nLittle Boy finds his racism lessons interrupted when a kindly priest (the superb Tom Wilkinson) forces him to befriend the other most bullied person in their coastal California town -- Hashimoto (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa), an older man just released from an internment camp.\n\nThe kid, just 8 years old when the movie starts, is a huge fan of a comic-book and movie-serial magician (Ben Chaplin, cute), whose personal appearance at the local theater convinces Pepper and a lot of his peers that Little Boy has magical powers. In a child's mind, faith and magic are given equal billing. Catholic teachings that \"a mustard seed\" of faith \"can move mountains\" lead to the confusion. But the priest guides Pepper's Christian education, even if he's not sure that Pepper moved a mountain, that it might have just been an earthquake. And no, Pepper can't end the war and save his father just by pointing his hands at the sun setting over Japan.\n\n\"Your faith won't work if you have even the slightest bit of hatred in you,\" he counsels, and the kid listens.\n\nWriter\/director Alejandro Monteverde, who made the 2006 anti-abortion drama \"Bella,\" will give you whiplash with his abrupt changes in tone. Newsreels and animation mimic the racist propaganda of the day, while the teen brother, egged on by the grieving father of a combat casualty, takes up drinking and hate crimes. Mom (Emily Watson) weeps for her missing-in-action husband and is hounded by the opportunistic doctor (Kevin James) who thinks she's a widow. The cute kid dreams of saving the day, and has nightmares about what another \"Little Boy\" did to Hiroshima.\n\n\"Little Boy\" is all over the place and unsure of its audience. The \"Touched by an Angel\/Son of God\" team of Roma Downey Jr. and Mark Burnett produced this melodrama and got it into theaters. The \"magic\" of religion is challenged by the faithless, and the idea of literal miracles is pointedly dismissed.\n\nBut where would this \"Little Boy\" be without faith, without believing in something greater than all the woes that face his world? That lesson, and the kindly and sympathetic presence of Wilkinson, makes this scattered but upbeat serving of schmaltz more palatable than the angrier \"God's Not Dead\" fare making it into theaters.","439":"Fed Cup: Ankita Raina Shines With Two Wins As India Make History | Tennis News The Indian Fed cup team created history by progressing to the play-offs for the first time ever with Ankita Raina leading the side to a 2-1 win over Indonesia in Dubai.

They complain that office hours are irregular, the fines keep changing and they aren't given receipts. They're annoyed by predatory companies, often hired by apartment managers, that patrol parking lots and tow cars the minute their parking time is up.\n\n\"Really our intention with this business license is that people who start tow operations here have a good record ... and are communicating effectively,\" Larson said.\n\nThe ordinance exempts towing that's done at the request of a car's owner, such as in an emergency or for repairs. To get a license, towing companies must agree to background checks for employees and provide addresses, hours of operation, fee schedules and the license plate numbers of its trucks. They also must meet certain insurance requirements.\n\nThe towing license costs $400 the first year, which includes the background check, and $100 for renewals.\n\nSavage-based towing companies -- there are at least four -- \"aren't crazy about\" the new rules, said Council Member Matt Johnson, and see licensure as another hoop they must jump through.\n\nNone of the companies returned calls for comment. But Allen's Service, a longtime Savage business, sent an e-mail to city officials saying they \"strongly oppose\" the license requirement because it won't solve existing problems with towing companies, according to city documents.\n\nAdam Hlavac, co-owner of All-N-One Towing in Apple Valley, said he wondered if companies will need to have 10 licenses for 10 different cities in the future. He wishes municipalities would instead work together on standards, he said.\n\n\"There's always going to be people doing bad business -- you're never going to get a wrap on that,\" he said.\n\nLance Klatt, executive director of the Minnesota Professional Towing Association, said his operators follow all state and federal regulations.\n\nDeterring bad actors\n\nWhen Donovan Pohl's car got towed outside his Savage apartment complex after a snowstorm in 2019, it kicked off a monthslong saga that ended with the loss of his 2017 Jeep Cherokee.\n\nPohl, who commutes between Minnesota and Arizona, couldn't pick up the towed SUV for a week. When he arrived at Artemis Recovery in Savage at 8 one morning to pick it up, the manager wouldn't take his cash until 8:30 a.m. He left after exchanging some choice words, he said.\n\nPohl said he wasn't aware he would be charged storage fees for the three weeks his vehicle sat in the lot. Before long he owed $1,200, money he said he didn't have. He said he never received the certified letter or saw the notice published in City Pages, both state requirements, saying that his car -- on which he was still making payments -- would be sold.\n\nArtemis, which declined to comment, sold his SUV to the company's owner. And Pohl is trying to figure out what legal recourse he has.\n\n\"It doesn't just make me angry,\" Pohl said. \"It was consuming my whole life.\"\n\nJohnson called Pohl's case \"atrocious\" and said it was one reason for the new ordinance, though he conceded \"the family didn't handle it the best.\"\n\nState law mandates many aspects of towing, including when a company has authority to impound a car, requiring notice that a car is impounded or will be sold, the owner's rights in reclaiming cars, and waiting periods before a sale. It also regulates the kind of lights a tow truck must have. But the state doesn't say much about how towing companies must run their business.\n\nSavage officials leaned on Minneapolis and St. Paul's ordinances, they said, as well as their own massage business regulations, to craft the towing ordinance.\n\nTowing companies operating in Savage will have a six-month grace period to comply with the new rules. The city has a list of every towing company within 20 miles and plans to send them letters, as well as provide explanations in the city newsletter and on social media.\n\nThe ordinance won't solve every problem, but it offers another tool to protect individual rights, city officials said.\n\n\"It has the potential to deter a lot of the bad actors,\" Larson said.","441":"Federal Prosecutors Say Russia And Qatar Paid Bribes To Host World Cups Russia and Qatar paid bribes in order to win hosting rights to the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, according to a sweeping new indictment in the federal government's long-running soccer corruption case unsealed Monday.\n\nThe new charges lay out a complex series of bribery and money laundering schemes related to the buying and selling of rights to international soccer tournaments and implicate multiple new defendants, including two former high-ranking Latin American executives of 21st Century Fox, the former media conglomerate that has since been acquired by Disney.\n\nBut the boldest allegations relate to the World Cup, soccer's most esteemed and lucrative tournament, held every four years. Although there has long been public suspicion about corruption during the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 events, the new charges mark the first time the US government has formally put those suspicions into a charging document.\n\nAccording to the prosecutors, Russia in 2010 paid $5 million to Trinidad's Jack Warner, then a FIFA vice president, in exchange for his vote to host the event in 2018; it also offered -- though never paid -- an additional $1 million to Rafael Salguero, a Guatemalan official who, as a member of FIFA's executive committee, also had a vote.\n\nIn addition, the indictment claims, Qatar paid bribes to three South American soccer officials, including Brazilian Ricardo Teixeira and Paraguayan Nicol\u00e1s Leoz, for their votes for it to host the 2022 tournament. The third official is not named in the document, but is widely acknowledged to be Julio Grondona, also a former FIFA vice president. The size of those alleged bribes was not enumerated in the court filing. According to trial testimony from 2017, however, Qatar paid at least $1 million and as much as $15 million to those three officials for their votes\n\nBoth Russia and Qatar ultimately won their bids in a secret vote in December 2010, beating out rival bids from England, the US, Australia, and several other countries.\n\nRussia held the tournament in 2018, and the day after it concluded, President Trump held a press conference with Vladimir Putin, congratulating him \"for having done such an excellent job in hosting the World Cup. It was really one of the best ever, he said. \"It was a great job.\"","442":"Fifa exco members took bribes for Qatar World Cup votes, US prosecutors allege Former Conmebol president among executives namedJack Warner allegedly received $5m to back Russia 2018\n\nProsecutors in New York have revealed new details of alleged bribes paid to Fifa executive committee members to gain their votes for Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup.\n\nAn indictment unsealed on Monday in the US District Court in Brooklyn says Nicol\u00e1s Leoz, the Paraguayan then president of the South American governing body, Conmebol, and the former Brazil federation president Ricardo Teixeira received bribes to vote for Qatar at the 2010 Fifa executive committee meeting.\n\nJack Warner, the former president of Concacaf, the governing body for North and Central America, is said to have received $5m in bribes to vote for Russia to host in 2018. The money allegedly came from 10 different shell companies, including entities in Anguilla, Cyprus and the British Virgin Islands.\n\nThe Guatemala federation president, Rafael Salguero, was also promised a $1m bribe to vote for Russia, according to the indictment. Leoz, who died last August, avoided extradition, as have Warner, from Trinidad & Tobago, and Teixeira. Salguero pleaded guilty in 2018 to two counts of wire fraud conspiracy, and one count each of racketeering conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy.\n\nAlejandro Burzaco, the Argentinian former head of the marketing company Torneos y Competencias, testified in 2017 that all three South Americans on the Fifa executive committee took million-dollar bribes to support Qatar, which beat the US in the final vote.\n\nIn a statement, William F Sweeney Jr., assistant director in charge of the FBI's New York field office, said: \"The profiteering and bribery in international soccer have been deep-seated and commonly known practices for decades.\"\n\nHe added: \"The defendants and their co-conspirators corrupted the governance and business of international soccer with bribes and kickbacks, and engaged in criminal fraudulent schemes that caused significant harm to the sport of soccer.\"\n\nSince the first indictments were announced in May 2015, there have been 26 publicly announced guilty pleas, many from former soccer officials, including the American general secretary of Concacaf, Chuck Blazer. The Conmebol president, Juan \u00c1ngel Napout of Paraguay, and Brazil federation president Jos\u00e9 Maria Marin were convicted following trials.\n\nThe US Department of Justice also announced that two former 21st Century Fox executives, Hernan Lopez and Carlos Martinez, have been charged with making payments to Conmebol officials in order to obtain broadcast rights bidding information. Fox gained the broadcast rights for the 2018 and 2022 tournaments in 2011, with Fifa later awarded Fox rights for 2026 without competitive bidding.\n\nLopez and Martinez are also accused of joining with a Uruguayan company, Full Play Group SA, to pay million of dollars in bribes to Conmebol executives in exchange for rights to the Copa Libertadores, South America's annual club championship.\n\nGerard Romy, the Spanish former CEO of Imagina Media Audiovisual, is accused with joining his alleged co-conspirators to pay a $3m bribe to Jeffrey Webb, the former president of Concacaf, for media and marketing rights to home World Cup qualifiers in the Caribbean. Webb, from the Cayman Islands, pleaded guilty in November 2015 to several counts and awaits sentencing.","443":"Figuring out the Twins (as fans and as the manager) Hockey and other stuff has cut into some of my baseball watching, but I'm among those trying to figure out what what we'll be seeing as the Twins' season continues to unfold. After that first road trip, the 1-5 disaster in which almost everything went wrong or was done poorly, you had reason to wonder how quickly the season was going to dissolve into chaos. After the last dozen games, in which the Twins went 7-5, you could piece together an argument or two for hope.\n\nThe numbers are too fluid to mean much for now. in Sunday's victory at Seattle, Joe Mauer increased his OPS by 90 points with a triple, double and single, and moved his slugging percentage from Puntonian depths to something more respectable. Phil Hughes has lost his first four starts while putting up statistics better than his first four from 2014, from which he rebounded to become the staff ace. (There's legitimate concern about Hughes never putting together consecutive good seasons as a starting pitcher.)\n\nI was squeamish about a couple of things Paul Molitor did in his first week of managing. Since then, however, I have been impressed by the juggling he has done to make as much as possible of what he has on the roster. On many days, that has meant starting a couple of players who would be reserves on a higher quality team and youngsters (Kennys Vargas, Danny Santana and Oswaldo Arcia) who are, for the moment, flailing and failing.\n\nHow badly are they flailing right now? Add up their OPS+ numbers and the three of them combined are at 113 -- three below Mauer's Sunday-enhanced 116.\n\nWhen Ron Gardenhire's managing was more black-and-white, Molitor's palate feels more subtle. I will still cringe when Blaine Boyer and Tim Stauffer walk in from the bullpen, but most pitching staffs have a couple of liabilities. The starting pitchers are the ones who can make those relievers less relevant by pitching the way Hughes did on Friday and Kyle Gibson did on Sunday.\n\nAnd, yes, I'm happy for Mike Pelfrey. He was excellent against Kansas City and, in his previous start, stayed out of enough trouble that the Twins were able to win a game that the Cy Young winner, Cory Kluber, started for Cleveland. I liked the way Molitor and Neil Allen handled him in those (very different) starts, and he doesn't deserve an automatic demotion when Ricky Nolasco returns. If anything, Nolasco is No. 6 on the list of starters right now, pending what plays out with Trevor May's line drive-smoked elbow.\n\nMolitor has also survived so far the subpar play of the starting outfield (Arcia, Jordan Schafer and Torii Hunter), which was predictable, and Brian Dozier's slow start, which wasn't. I am guessing that it makes Molitor almost as nervous as the rest of us to put one of the Eduardos in left field, but that's a better call than putting Shane Robinson and Schafer in the lineup together. The question for Molitor could become whether Robinson, who has been better than expected, gets more of Schafer's playing time. (The bigger question for the organization, of course, is how quickly can it get Byron Buxton Twins ready.)\n\nAn 8-10 record through the season's first three weeks is better than what I expected after that first week. I stand by my earlier position that the Twins have very little margin for error on most days. It's not a team that can bull its way through defensive mistakes and bad pitching with its offense.\n\nBut it's a more interesting team than I had imagined and I'm curious to see how Molitor handles things as the season grinds on.","444":"Film: Why safety Anthony Harris is getting the franchise tag from Vikings Edit: This post has been updated to reflect the Vikings using the franchise tag on Harris on Monday morning. The move prevents Harris from reaching unrestricted free agency by Wednesday and gives the Vikings time to explore options, including a trade or long-term deal.\n\nWhenever safety Anthony Harris Harris agrees to his first big-time contract, which could come from the Vikings after he was surprisingly given the franchise tag Monday morning, his teammates will appreciate what the money represents: the muddiest ascent up the NFL ladder in going undrafted, signing for a $10,000 bonus, making the practice squad and playing special teams before starting.\n\n\"That gets me emotional, honestly,\" linebacker Eric Kendricks said in September. \"I've seen him go through a lot. I've seen him start from the bottom, legitimately. All he did was work. All he did was battle. He's a humble guy and he knows his role on the team. There's no question why we see him have success.\"\n\nBefore Harris was the only NFL safety in 2019 with seven interceptions and no touchdowns allowed, he was the whiz-kid newcomer at Winter Park acing pop quizzes in meetings and projecting the success to come. Should head coach Mike Zimmer need to replace Harris, intelligence would top the list of desirable traits after he made his mark with disciplined coverage and impeccable timing.\n\n\"Whoever that is has to have some smarts, because those guys do a lot on the back end,\" Zimmer said Feb. 26. \"I love Anthony. If he doesn't come back, I think he's earned whatever he's gotten, but if you put up the positions that are the most important on defense, it's probably not going to be safety. We'll figure out a way if he's not back.\"\n\nFree safety\n\nHarris shut down passing lanes from varied assignments, but he was the Vikings' main free safety in single-high coverages like this during the NFC wild-card playoff win in New Orleans. This is where Harris should find a home with another NFL team.\n\nOn a third-and-6 play against the Saints, Harris (#41) edged toward the side of receiver Michael Thomas (#13) while manning the middle alone. Thomas is about to run a dig route underneath Harris, which sets up Drew Brees' deep ball to Ted Ginn Jr. (#19). Cornerback Trae Waynes motions to Harris before the snap, inferring they've got a clue what's coming.\n\nHarris backpedals immediately. Brees, perhaps seeing Harris lurking toward Thomas' side, is locked into the deep throw. He winds up to Ginn before Thomas really clears the middle of the field. Harris reads the quarterback and breaks on the go route before the ball leaves Brees' hand.\n\nHarris has some limitations as a man coverage defender because he doesn't boast top-tier athleticism in NFL standards. But instincts often put Harris in the right place in the right time last season, including the first of his two interceptions against the Falcons during the Week 1 win.\n\nSet to cover Falcons tight end Austin Hooper (#81), Harris said he \"fell into\" this pick. Facing intense pressure, Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan forced this pass to receiver Julio Jones (#11) where Harris was simply transitioning out of his original assignment. Hooper crossed the formation to block, leading to Harris' smooth transition to shift his eyes to the quarterback and follow the ball.\n\n\"I was trying to cover my guy, keep my eyes on the tight end,\" Harris said at the time. \"Saw him slash across the formation and he was blocking, so I tried to free up and help where I could and fell into an interception.\"\n\nBut Harris said \"having good eyes\" actually factored most into reading this play before a red-zone interception against the Falcons. Vikings coaches lauded Harris' ability to use the circumstances of a given situation to his advantage, like posting up Falcons tight end Luke Stocker in the end zone knowing he had one way to go. Only one NFL defense - the Broncos - allowed fewer points per red-zone trip than the Vikings (4.23) last season, per Football Outsiders.\n\nSeeing Matt Ryan's play-action bootleg, Harris maintains his leverage to the outside of Stocker (#80), understanding routes will flow that way. Once again, pressure leads to a desperation throw and Harris is there for the pick.\n\nThe Vikings run defense actually didn't get as much help from safeties in 2019 as its accustomed. Poor outside coverage seemingly trickled to the back end, where Harrison Smith was required to help and therefore kept away from the line of scrimmage more often than any season since 2015, according to Pro Football Focus. And attacking downhill isn't Harris' natural strength, so they combined for the fewest run stops in a regular season among Vikings starting safeties under Zimmer.\n\nThe limitations that nudged Harris out of the 2015 NFL Draft, outside of shoulder surgery at the time, remain to some degree. He won't get a huge contract this month to be an in-the-box wrecking ball or guard shifty slot receivers.\n\nBut Harris is rarely out of place. Proper angles and anticipation helped him consistently save big plays. Only the No. 1-ranked rushing defense in Tampa Bay allowed fewer 20-yard runs than the Vikings last season.\n\nThis doesn't count as a \"stop\" for Harris, but Kerryon Johnson's six-yard run in the first quarter of the Week 7 win in Detroit could've been much worse had he not recognized the counter run. Harris was nearly alone on his side of the field while linebackers flowed with the counter fake.","445":"Finalists announced for Dayton Literary Peace Prize Twelve writers, including Tara Westover and Tommy Orange, have been nominated for the Dayton Literary Peace Prize, an annual award that goes to one fiction writer and one nonfiction writer who address the theme of peace in their work.\n\nMoriel Rothman Zecher, a National Book Foundation \"5 Under 35\" honoree, for her debut, \"Sadness is a White Bird.\"\n\nDavid Blight, for his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography, \"Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom.\"\n\nWil Haygood, for \"Tigerland.\"\n\nAnthony Hinton with Lara Love Hardin, for \"The Sun Does Shine.\"","446":"Find The Pigeon Of Your Dreams Because we can't make this stuff up: introducing Hatoful Boyfriend, a Japanese dating sim where you're a human girl at a high school populated entirely by pigeons, and one pudgie who acts as the school doctor.

This came hours after Delhi government suspended all sporting activity in the national capital due to the ever-growing health crisis.\n\nDelhi is home to the Delhi Capitals IPL franchise. In his first reactions post the suspension of the cash-rich league that has a lot riding on it, BCCI president Sourav Ganguly said safety is the \"first priority\". \"First priority is safety, so we postponed the games,\" Ganguly said.\n\n\"We will see what happens. It is too early to answer,\" the former India captain added when asked if there will be more double headers if they are able to host it from April 15. The BCCI statement made it clear that it's \"suspension\" and \"not postponement\" which means that there is no clarity on whether the event will start on April 15.\n\nEven if it starts on April 15,it is expected to happen behind closed doors without the fans. So far, India has recorded more than 80 positive cases and one death due to the pandemic which has claimed over 5,000 lives globally.\n\nThe BCCI will discuss all the modalities of this year's edition at the IPL Governing Council meeting in Mumbai on Saturday. \"The BCCI is concerned and sensitive about all its stakeholders, and public health in general, and it is taking all necessary steps to ensure that, all people related to IPL including fans have a safe cricketing experience,\" Shah stated.\n\n\"The BCCI will work closely with the Government of India along with the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and all other relevant Central and State Government departments in this regard,\" he added.\n\nThere is a possibility that the tournament will feature more double-headers than previously planned and at least five optional venues are being kept ready after state governments of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Delhi refused permission for the games.\n\n\"The only option left was postponement of the tournament till the visa ban is lifted (April 15). All the franchises have made it clear that there is no point of an IPL without foreign recruits,\" a senior BCCI official told PTI on conditions of anonymity.\n\n\"In any case, foreign players with Business (B2) visa are not in exempted category. The second reason is that three state governments have decided against having IPL games. So, there are logistical issues that need to be sorted. \"We need some time to figure that out,\" the official said.\n\nThe IPL was originally scheduled to start on March 29 and end on May 24 making it a 56-day affair.\n\nIn case the BCCI is able to start the tournament on April 15, it will be a 40-day competition as the ICC Future Tours Programme (FTP) of other international teams will make it virtually impossible to stretch it beyond that point.\n\n\"Either the format of each team playing each other twice needs to be tweaked or we have to go for as many as possible double headers. This year, the decision was made to have only five double headers but now things have changed drastically,\" the official said.\n\nThe franchise owners are also hoping that in case the IPL starts on April 15, the state governments, which have denied permission for matches, will be ready to give the green light should the situation improves.\n\n\"The state government is a necessary arm as they provide the security (police) and also the various wings that work in tandem with BCCI. In case, Delhi (DC), Bengaluru (RCB) and Maharashtra (Mumbai Indians) decide against hosting games, there will be alternate venues that will be ready,\" said the BCCI source.\n\nSome of the alternate venues that will be kept ready include Lucknow, Rajkot, Indore, Raipur, Visakhapatnam for these franchises.\n\nPune is currently out of equation with at least 10 positive cases reported from the city. There are other teething issues as well including the fee that the franchises need to pay to the host association, which many would like to re-negotiate.\n\n\"The franchises was supposed to pay Rs 50 lakh to host associations, which was more than the earlier Rs 30 lakh. Certainly, they would like to re-negotiate now in case they can't raise enough sponsorship money,\" a BCCI official in know of things said.\n\nIn case of a closed-door event and restricted public appearances by players, the franchises are bound to lose out on a lot of sponsorship money as well as the gate money. Star Sports, which has paid a whopping Rs 16,347 crore for five years (nearly Rs 5500 crore per year) for broadcast rights, might like to re-negotiate the deal with the BCCI in case of a curtailed IPL.","450":"First-ever warehouse sale for brides, crafters at Roseville floral-wholesaler Kennicott Brothers floral wholesale in Roseville will have its first warehouse sale after nearly a decade in business in the Twin Cities.

Colorado's interest in trading Arenado this offseason, in conjunction with a public rift between the third baseman and general manager Jeff Bridich, have only fueled the intrigue. With the egg Colorado laid last year, Arenado seems a sure bet to opt out of his contract following the 2021 season. That would make the odds pretty high that Colorado trades Arenado by the July 31 deadline if the team isn't in contention.\n\nThere's a lot to be optimistic about with the lineup, with a new era of Blake Street Bombers in Arenado, Trevor Story, Charlie Blackmon and David Dahl. But whether the pitching staff can turn it around -- Colorado posted a major league-worst 5.56 ERA last season -- is another question altogether, especially within the notorious pinball confines of Coors Field. The Rockies need bounce-backs in the rotation (Kyle Freeland, Antonio Senzatela) and from several arms in the bullpen (Wade Davis, Bryan Shaw, et al). That's asking a lot.\n\nThough Colorado is projected by most analysts to finish in the bottom half of the National League West -- Fangraphs has the Rockies pegged for fourth place and 75 wins -- they have a bunch of young players who could emerge in a big way this season. Topping that list is infielder Ryan McMahon, who blasted 24 homers in his first full season last year. Second baseman Brendan Rodgers, outfielders Raimel Tapia and Sam Hilliard, and right-hander Peter Lambert also have the potential to break through this season.\n\nSpeaking of developing into a star, Dahl did just that in 2019 while slashing .302\/.353\/.524 with 15 homers in his first all-star season. But Dahl's season was cut short in early August by a high ankle sprain. He has yet to play more than 100 games in each of his three seasons in the major leagues as injuries have offset his trajectory. But having Dahl as an everyday, healthy player in the lineup could be a game-changer for Colorado, especially if he gets north of 140 starts. A full season could propel Dahl into superstardom.\n\nColorado had a wide playoff window entering last season. The Rockies were coming off consecutive postseason berths for the first time in franchise history and had just locked up Nolan Arenado to an eight-year contract. But now, with Arenado's exit from Colorado seemingly imminent and major questions resurfacing with the pitching, the outlook appears bleak. Playoffs or not, where Colorado finishes in 2020 -- Bottom of the division cellar? Wild card contention into September? -- will say much about the overall direction of the franchise.","453":"Five years on from the Charlie Hebdo attack, 'Je suis Charlie' rings hollow The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations\n\nAfter the terror attack on the Paris office of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo on January 7 2015 left 12 people dead, many declared \"Je suis Charlie\" (\"I am Charlie\") in solidarity. But behind the understandable emotion that accompanied such declarations lay a more complicated reality. Many reactions to the attack were more conservative than first appeared, and not in keeping with the values of the publication. Five years on, \"Je suis Charlie\" has quite a hollow ring to it.\n\nBefore 2015, about 40,000 people read Charlie Hebdo each week. Given that many hundreds of thousands declared \"je suis Charlie\", most were clearly not regular readers. \"Je suis Charlie\" primarily appears to have been a statement of sympathy rather than an endorsement of the brand of humour of this subversive publication. The phrase also symbolised a desire to defend freedom of expression, although not necessarily an agreement with the ways in which Charlie Hebdo has expressed itself.\n\nCharlie Hebdo has traditionally taken pride in describing itself as a \"journal irresponsable\" (irresponsible newspaper). It has been happy to describe its humour as \"b\u00eate et m\u00e9chant\" (stupid and nasty). This sometimes dark and provocative humour has attracted criticism over the years, not least from politicians. Yet many authority figures that Charlie Hebdo had ruthlessly mocked were present in the demonstrations that took place in January 2015.\n\nAnd as was observed at the time, the presence of certain world leaders also pointed to a degree of hypocrisy. Where many sought to defend freedom of speech, there were several leaders who had restricted freedom of expression in their own countries. The international non-profit organisation Reporters Without Borders was particularly critical of figures such as Egyptian foreign minister Sameh Shoukry, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu.\n\nCommemorating while forgetting\n\nCharlie Hebdo has generally been keen to laugh about anything and everything, and in whatever way it pleases. But despite the focus on freedom of expression in the aftermath to the 2015 attack, there were noticeable inconsistencies. In the immediate aftermath, several topical comedy programmes on French television were not broadcast as writers and presenters struggled to find a way to engage with such horrific events in a humorous manner.\n\nA rare exception was the Canal Plus show Les Guignols, whose brand of humour was sometimes similar to Charlie Hebdo. The daily programme, which featured latex puppets of many well known figures, included several sketches about the attack, broadcast only hours after it had taken place. These included jokes about increased levels of terror threats. It also involved a latex puppet of the Prophet Muhammad distancing himself from the attackers. The show, which was dedicated to the magazine, concluded with a sketch in which several of the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists who had been killed were allowed into heaven despite having frequently mocked religion.\n\nYet many sections of the French media, and French society in general, were reluctant to embrace such dark humour. At an event in September 2017, comedian J\u00e9r\u00e9my Ferrari told of how several television stations cancelled planned interviews with him about his new show in early 2015. Stations may have been making time to discuss freedom of expression, but he said they seemed reluctant to discuss the way his stand-up show mocked war and terrorism.\n\nPeople who sought to play down or joke about the Charlie Hebdo attack in France in early 2005 also risked being charged with the offence of \"l'apologie du terrorisme\" (excusing terrorism). In a school north of Paris, a pupil was reportedly disciplined for laughing at a joke about the name of a gunman who killed several people in the days after the Charlie Hebdo attack, and was made to repeatedly write the phrase \"one does not laugh about serious things\".\n\nA challenge for comedians\n\nSeveral years on, as I explore in my recent book on the topic, French comedians seem torn between insisting on the importance of being able to joke about whatever topics they wish and worrying about the consequences of doing so.\n\nIn 2015, the comedian Sophia Aram started performing a show in which she defended Charlie Hebdo and its values. She insists on the importance of continuing to freely mock religion and extremism.\n\nMustapha El Atrassi - a comedian who shares Aram's French-Moroccan roots and was also brought up in a Muslim family - also insists on the need to keep embracing jokes that deal with taboos. But he argues too that not all comedians are equally free to joke about terrorism. He said that a French comedian called \"Maxence\" - a stereotypically white, European, middle class name - is likely to get a much more positive response to dark humour about terrorism than someone from his background.\n\nFocusing on the depictions of the Prophet Muhammad that made Charlie Hebdo a target for fundamentalists, meanwhile, the comedian St\u00e9phane Guillon said in 2016: \"If you can die due to a drawing, you can die due to a sketch.\" He again evoked his fear of the potentially dangerous consequences of mocking the Prophet Muhammad on stage in 2018. At an event to commemorate the third anniversary of the Charlie Hebdo attack, the normally acerbic comic stated: \"I don't want to miss out on seeing my children grow up due to a joke about Muhammad.\"\n\nFive years on, France has not continued to embrace values associated with Charlie Hebdo. Shortly after the attack, the magazine's number of subscribers rose to 260,000 and six months on it was selling 120,000 copies each week via newsagents. But by 2018, it had only 35,000 subscribers and sold a further 35,000 copies per week to non-subscribers. After a further decline in sales, it marked the fourth anniversary of the attacks in 2019 with an editorial that asked its readers: \"Are you still there?\"\n\nOne thing that is certainly not still there is Canal Plus's Les Guignols, the satirical show featuring latex puppets. Its four main writers were fired in summer 2015 and the show moved to a less prominent slot. In 2018, the iconic show was finally cancelled by Canal.\n\nUltimately, France seems much less keen to embrace biting satirical humour than it initially appeared back in 2015.\n\nJonathan Ervine is the author of:\n\nHumour in Contemporary France: Controversy, Consensus and Contradictions\n\nLiverpool University Press provides funding as a content partner of The Conversation UK","454":"Five-foot crocodile rescued in Vadodara | Vadodara News - Times of India Vadodara: A five-foot crocodile was rescued from Waghodia taluka on Sunday night.

Here we take a look at the surprises and disappointments for the Florida Panthers.\n\nSergei Bobrovsky's slow start\n\nThis has not yet worked out as hoped.\n\nEven during the 2018-19 season it seemed to be a foregone conclusion that the Panthers were going to do everything in their power to throw a truck load of money at Bobrovsky on the free agent market in an effort to fix their biggest organizational weakness from a year ago -- goaltending.\n\nThey desperately needed a goalie, Bobrovsky was the best goalie available on the market, and he has a track record of being one of the best goalies in the league. It was a perfect match, even if an expensive one.\n\nThe Panthers ended up signing him to a seven-year, $70 million contract. It certainly came with some risks and concerns, with the biggest one being how long he would be worth such a monstrous salary cap number. Given his age and the normal aging curve for goalies there was an expectation that the contract would become an albatross before it expired, but that the Panthers should still get some high-level years out of their prized addition. So far, they have not even received that.\n\nBobrovsky got off to a massively disappointing start that has resulted in one of the worst overall seasons of his career. It would be entirely unfair to put all of the blame on him -- the Panthers are lousy defensively -- but there is no question that his performance has been less than expected. He has been better since the start of December, but still not what the Panthers hoped for.\n\nNoel Acciari's 20-goal season\n\nThe Panthers were extremely busy this past summer on the free agent market, and one of their most successful signings has probably been the one that received the least fanfare at the time.\n\nBefore this season the 28-year-old Acciari had scored 18 goals 180 career games with the Boston Bruins.\n\nThis season? He already has 20 goals in 66 games with the Panthers, including back-to-back hat tricks in mid-December.\n\nSure, he is riding an exceptionally high shooting percentage that will eventually regress (18 percent), but 20 goals in 66 games is still a positive development. Can not take those goals away. They still happened.\n\nChris Driedger a pleasant surprise in net\n\nBefore this season Driedger had appeared in just three NHL games, and none since the 2016-17 season.\n\nEven though his sampling this season has been small (only 12 appearances) he has still been one of the more pleasant surprises for the Panthers thanks to a 7-2-1 record and .938 save percentage.\n\nHe has spent most of his career bouncing back and forth between the ECHL and AHL (and posting very good numbers along the way) without really getting much of an opportunity at the highest level. He was able to take advantage of it this season and has helped keep the Panthers in the playoff race when they needed a short-term boost in goal.\n\nThe Vincent Trocheck trade made little sense\n\nBy little sense, I actually mean no sense.\n\nJust before the NHL trade deadline, and with the Panthers still very much in the race, they traded Trocheck to the Carolina Hurricanes for what basically looked to be a quantity over quality return.\n\nAll signs indicated that it was trade done simply to \"shake things up\" for a team that was struggling.\n\nThe problem with that mindset is that Trocheck was not only one of their core players and still signed beyond this season, but they were also moving him at what might have been his lowest value and did not even address their biggest need -- defense. What was the point? It simply was not good asset management from a team that has demonstrated some poor asset management habits in the very recent past. It just seemed like the type of move that would be a letdown for Panthers fans that are desperate for a competitive hockey team, and one that might finally make the playoffs with some regularity.\n\nMORE PANTHERS:\n\n* Looking at the 2019-20 Florida Panthers\n\n--\n\nAdam Gretz is a writer for Pro Hockey Talk on NBC Sports.

She was taken into custody early in the morning of Apr. 4 for allegedly stabbing his baby mama LaPattra Jacobs at Youngboy's Texas home. YaYa was seen sidling up behind her man as seen in an April 4 Instagram story after her release. But even more, they were relaxing in his bed in an April 6 Instagram story he shared. The 20-year-old -- real name Kentrell DeSean Gaulden -- is seen laying back as he tells YaYa, \"I smoked weed yesterday, for the last time.\" You can see the video here.\n\nYaYa can be heard telling him, \"today, today...probably about,\" before be cuts her off to claim it was yesterday. Youngboy is seen rocking a massive amounts of bling, including diamond chain and gargantuan circular pendant. He's also got ice dripping off his wrists in the form of large diamond bracelets. While YaYa isn't seen on camera, it's her voice that can be heard.\n\nThe couple is back together after a very dramatic weekend. TMZ first reported that police were called to his Texas home for a domestic disturbance. YaYa allegedly came home to find LaPattra and Youngboy hanging out. When she ordered her to leave, the two reportedly got into a fight, where YaYa allegedly grabbed two knives and stabbed LaPattra in the bicep. EMT's rushed her to a Houston area hospital in stable condition. The stab wounds apparently ended up being non-life threatening injuries. YaYa was taken into custody by Harris County Sheriff's deputies and booked for felony aggravated assault.\n\nOn Apr. 6, TMZ Sports obtained YaYa's mugshot from the Harris County Sheriff's Department. She is seen with purple hair and makeup free, giving and ice cold stare into the camera. YaYa actually made bail pretty quickly because by the evening of Apr. 4 (the alleged stabbing went down around 1:30am) she was back at Youngboy's crib as seen in an Instagram live video. He went off ranting at Kodak Black for allegedly saying that Youngboy cooperated with police after the incident. He also called YaYa his \"wife,\" as she stood behind her fiancee in the IG live. Youngboy was absolutely livid in the videos, which you can see above and are incredibly NFSW.","457":"Foil dryer ducts: code-approved? Foil dryer transition ducts are allowed by code and by some clothes dryer manufacturers. This seems to be a frequent topic of discussion and confusion amongst home inspectors, so I'm going to shed some light on the topic. First, let's define what a dryer transition duct is.\n\nA dryer transition duct is a flexible section of duct that can be used to connect a clothes dryer to the duct. The duct itself must consist of rigid metal.\n\nThe building code is actually silent on the type of material that may be used for a dryer transition duct. The code simply says that dryer transition ducts must be UL 2158A listed. They leave it up to UL to figure out what passes muster and what doesn't.\n\nThe building code also requires clothes dryers to be installed according to the manufacturer's installation instructions, in accordance with section 304.1 of the Minnesota Mechanical Code. This section corresponds to section M1307.1 in the 2018 IRC for people in other parts of the country.\n\nIf you stop by any home improvement store, you'll find that the products sold as dryer transitions ducts are mostly UL 2158A listed. Not all of them, but most of them. I have a bunch of comparison photos in my blog post on dryer duct safety.\n\nClothes dryer manufacturers are surprisingly inconsistent with their requirements for dryer transition ducts. The following manufacturers do not allow dryer transition ducts that are made from foil, regardless of whether the duct is UL2158A or not:\n\nKenmore and LG aren't clear. In the same manual, they gave conflicting advice. Kenmore said If a flexible metal (foil type) duct is installed, it must be of a specific type identified by the appliance manufacturer as suitable for use with clothes dryers. So they're allowed, right? Not so fast. They also go on to say Check your vent to make sure it is rigid or semi-rigid metal ducting. If your venting is plastic or flexible foil, have it replaced before using the dryer.\n\nLG says To reduce the risk of fire, DO NOT exhaust the dryer with plastic or thin foil ducting, but then goes on to say In the United States, only those foil-type flexible ducts, if any, specifically identified for use with the appliance by the manufacturer and that comply with the Outline for Clothes Dryer Transition Duct, Subject 2158A, shall be used. So maybe it's cool. I'm not sure.\n\nSimilar advice is given by Samsung, Hotpoint, and GE. The crazy thing about GE, however, is how specific they get with their advice. They say the following: In special installations, it may be necessary to connect the dryer to the home exhaust vent using flexible metal (foil-type) transition duct. UL-LISTED universal flexible dryer transition duct (GE parts - PM8X73 or WX8X73) may be used ONLY in installations where rigid metal or flexible metal transition ducting cannot be used AND where a 4\" diameter can be maintained throughout the entire length of the transition duct.\n\nWhat's even crazier about GE is that they re-sell DryerFlex under the GE name (https:\/\/dryerflex.com\/), but they don't list it as an acceptable material in their installation manuals! Let me repeat: they put their name on this superior product, but they don't allow it on their own dryers. I think my head is going to explode.\n\nHey dryer manufacturers, can you please all get on the same page? One standard would really be nice. Thank you.\n\nThe bottom line is that foil dryer ducts are allowed by code and some manufacturers. That doesn't mean they're a great product, however. To demonstrate this, I partnered up with the fine folks at Family Handyman to do a video. I'll share that in next week's blog post.","458":"Food poisoning a great concern with donations, says groups PETALING JAYA: Donating excess food to the less fortunate is a good thing but food poisoning is a concern with cooked food, according to restaurant associations.\n\nMalaysian Muslim Restaurant Owners Association (Presma) president Datuk Jawahar Ali Taib Khan said he was not keen on cooked food donations due to safety issues.\n\n\"There is a chance of food poisoning. When cooked food is consumed right away, it is fine. If it's after some time, anything can happen.\n\n\"We are very particular as there can be bacterial contamination. If the food is given away, there is no guarantee on how safe it will be,\" he said yesterday.\n\nOn Monday, The Star highlighted the newly-gazetted Food Donors Protection Act 2020 gave protection to food donors from civil liability.\n\nThe previous Pakatan Harapan government introduced the Act in 2019 to complement the nationwide Food Bank programme.\n\nThe Act aims to encourage the public and corporations to donate food without fear of being sued.\n\nThe law covers not only those donating food \"without any payment or form of consideration\" but also volunteers or those involved in the distribution of such food.\n\nThe law, however, makes it clear that the donors can still be liable if it is proven that any personal injury, disease or death is due to their negligence or wilful misconduct.\n\nJawahar said Pressma members were willing to donate excess food, but it would be food safe to consume in a day or two such as cakes.\n\nMalaysia Singapore Coffeeshop Proprietors' General Association president Datuk Ho Su Mong echoed the view about food poisoning.\n\n\"All our food outlets in Malaysia are registered with the authorities, and this is one of the steps to ensure our food quality. Our members need to be careful when preparing food,\" he said.\n\nHo said authorities and food donors needed to work on a mechanism to ensure food could be given away quickly, adding that this would prevent food poisoning.\n\n\"We as coffeeshop operators are ready to donate food anytime. In a way (the Act) would affect the number of food donations but the government should perhaps come out with a one-stop food rescue centre so that free food could easily be given out to the needy,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Malaysian Association of Hotels (MAH) chief executive officer Yap Lip Seng pointed out that hotel policies were based on food safety standards.\n\n\"Food for buffets can only be served for a maximum of four hours, after that it is unsafe for consumption. Excess food for donation is managed differently,\" he said.\n\nHe said MAH and its member hotels had been working with the Food Aid Foundation (FAF) for many years prior to the gazetting of the Act to contribute food to the needy.\n\n\"FAF collects surplus food prepared which has not been served at the buffet line.\n\n\"It is clean, safe and can either be re-cooked or re-engineered. FAF does a great job doing this.\n\n\"The Act is something the industry had been asking for, and FAF has been actively pursuing the matter with the government,\" he said.","459":"Football Great Ronaldinho, Brother Arrested In Paraguay | Football News Former Brazilian football star Ronaldinho and his brother were arrested Friday in Asuncion, Paraguay's public ministry said, after entering the country on fake passports. \"The Attorney General's office issued a warrant for their arrest, charged the player Ronaldinho with using a public document with false content and requested preventative detention,\" the ministry tweeted.

It was a nice afternoon to watch Tommy Milone pitch the ball pretty much where he wanted and for Torii Hunter to show off a bit on the bases.\n\nThe Twins just aren't as bad as they played in Detroit. Even really good teams go through stretches where the pitching, hitting and defense all disappear at the same time. When it happens in the opening series of the season, though, it's a prime ingredient in buzzkill.\n\nSo far, the Twins have played four games in which there was no drama at the end, aside from whether Hunter was going to do something to umpire Joe West on Opening Day that would have been understandable but regrettable. I'm finding drama so far in what happens every time a ball is hit to Oswaldo Arcia in left field. Are you the one whose voice I hear muttering a prayer every time that happens? Arcia looks like a less comfortable version of Josh Willingham in the field. I hope time heals some of that.\n\nI'm not ready yet to draw conclusions. You need multiple weeks to do that correctly, and at least a few close games for any preliminary findings. Will there be as many sloppy at-bats in tight games? How will the relievers about whom we're rightfully suspicious do in the middle innings of a close game? Is Ricky Nolasco's season going to be another ongoing fiasco or can we put away my #FiascoNolasco hashtag? One excellent start isn't enough to prove anything, but have the Twins gotten something special in Milone, whose 2012 and '13 statistics with Oakland made trading for him last summer a good idea?\n\nFour games, no matter how well or badly played, judges nothing in baseball. The most it can do is raise questions, good or bad. Right now I'm wondering if a cobbled-together rotation made up mostly of No. 5 starters can hold together long enough until the Twins figure out what they really have in Nolasco, Kyle Gibson and Milone. I'm allowing myself to hope for the best there, which may be pinning too much hope on the change in pitching coaches. (I'm not allowing myself to think about Ervin Santana because his drug suspension is such an overwhelming disappointment. Those thoughts will get their own slow-day, in-context blog post.)\n\nThe Twins aren't off-the-charts good in any way to make up for their flaws. That's a battle we will watch them fight all season, I'm afraid. Detroit has Miguel Cabrera and Victor Martinez in the batting order to make up for struggles elsewhere. Kansas City has a bullpen that makes one-run leads feel safe. Those are two examples of being good enough in some areas to afford weaknesses in others.\n\nThe Twins used to have something like that in the Mauer\/Morneau days and are hoping to rekindle that down the road with Byron Buxton and Miguel Sano. Baseball is a tough game because a team can play better than the sum of its parts for a week or a month, and then the flaws overtake what's made them look good.\n\nFor Twins fans, the issue is when they'll be able to go from being hopeful to being confident of having some success. Think of it as a journey from watching with trepidation to coming to the ballpark with some swagger.","461":"Former Apple Engineering Leader Joins Microsoft to Work on HoloLens and Other Hardware Rub\u00e9n Caballero, a hardware engineering executive at Apple who worked with suppliers on modem hardware, has taken on a new role at Microsoft, reports Bloomberg.\n\nAt Microsoft, Caballero is serving as corporate vice president of engineering and based on his Linkedin profile, he will work on mixed reality hardware such as Microsoft's HoloLens.

His eyes widened like a teenager being shown a new car.\n\nThe college basketball coach who left Gonzaga in his late 30s to take over a Gophers program after one of the worst academic scandals in NCAA history, now returned in his late 50s in awe of a state-of-the-art athletic complex on par with most major Division I schools across the country.\n\nNeedless to say, the Long Beach State coach in his 13th year since resigning from the Gophers was envious.\n\n\"The facilities are second to none,\" said Monson, who coached at Minnesota from 1999-2006.\n\nSunday's story on the last two decades of Gophers basketball since the scandal under Clem Haskins looked in depth on how the program has attempted to make progress with the last three coaches, including Tubby Smith and Richard Pitino, now in his seventh season.\n\nHere is the rest of my 30-minute interview with Monson earlier this season when he reflected on his tenure and the challenges of getting the Gophers past the scandal.\n\nQ: When you look back on leaving Gonzaga after the Elite Eight run what did you remember about taking the Gophers job after the scandal?\n\nA: Part of that was that I was very na\u00efve coming in. I had only been a head coach for a couple years. There was a reason so many people turned that job down that were more established. I remember I turned the job down twice. I remember looking at [then-Gophers athletics director] Mark Dienhart and saying, 'I don't want to be the guy between Clem Haskins and the next coach here. I didn't want to be the cleanup guy.' Ultimately, I think that's what happened. I went in there with my eyes open. I was compensated very well for going in there and cleaning up.\n\nQ: How did you feel about the job that was done to move the Gophers forward? How difficult was the experience when your tenure ended?\n\nA: I'm very proud that I did what they hired me to do. The job was to come in after the biggest academic situation the NCAA had incurred and change that program into one of respect and one that people could look at and say they're doing it the right way. But at the end of the day, college athletics and revenue come from success on the court and winning. So, you know years later the cleanup process was over and they moved on. I felt like I left there a better coach than when I came in. I had to endure a lot of circumstances that I would've never imagined I was going to in my career. I got married two weeks after taking the job. I felt like I became a good father and a good husband, because I had to rely on my family. It felt like going through those times there was no one to really turn to, because we didn't know anybody back there. It ended up being very positive for me personally and professionally. I know ultimately for fans and the administration in the end it wasn't quick enough, but it was done the right way with the foundation that it was able to come back relatively quick from the situation and the penalties that were incurred.\n\nQ: You were able to recruit the only McDonald's All-Americans and players who have been drafted by the Gophers in the last two decades. Did that help the perception of the program getting Rick Rickert and Kris Humphries to stay home?\n\nA: Absolutely. I'll always be indebted to Rick and Kris for that matter. Two guys who had a lot of options. One of the innate advantages to the University of Minnesota basketball job is kids deep down grow up as Gophers. There's no other Division I school in the state. By in large kids grow up following that team and wanting to be a part of it. For Rick who originally committed to Arizona and had everybody in the world. Kris had Duke and Kansas in those opportunities. For those kids to believe in our program, come back and say, 'It's ok. This program is back. We can go anywhere in the country, but we chose to stay here and help bring that honor and prestige back to the state of Minnesota.'\n\nQ: What was it like coaching those high-profile recruits?\n\nA: The most rewarding thing is not only when you coach them but after you coach them. And the ones who stay in touch with you. Rick is one of the best kids in my 30 years of coaching with staying in touch with me. The irony is he lives right now in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, which is 10-15 miles from Spokane where Gonzaga is and where I started. We know the same people. He works for a car dealership where my dad bought a car from. I remember Kris calling me up the day he got engaged to Kim Kardashian, and he wanted me to come to the wedding. The day he found this gal he was going to marry. It was a tough time for those kids, and they realized it. They knew that they were coming in and people were going to scoff at their decision, but they believed in what we told them. That the University of Minnesota can come back from this and can have success. Even though, it was mixed success at the time those two came in there and represented the place and I was always indebted to them to take that leap of faith to come with us.\n\nQ: Your thoughts on the program's resources at the time? How were you able to deal with the facilities not being on par with other Big Ten programs?\n\nA: I was never one to use excuses like that. I took that job and I knew the facilities were the least of our concerns in recruiting. We had to find a special kid. That's why for the in-state kids the Barn for some of them was cool. They wanted to play there. When we were recruiting a kid, they had to have a special vision outside of facilities to come to the University of Minnesota when I was there. Because of the sanctions people weren't negative recruiting with us on facilities. They had much bigger ammo with the sanctions and the postseason ban and all those sorts of things that were incurred.\n\nQ: Have you seen Athletes Village, the Gophers new facility?\n\nA: I went to the Final Four and [basketball assistant of operations] Caitlin Mahoney gave us a tour of the new facilities there. How proud I am to see what [Gophers AD] Mark Coyle and Richard have done there as far as that. The facilities there are second to none. At the University of Minnesota, they should be very proud of where that program is after 20 years. Because the fact of the matter was, even though I don't believe it was a [big] factor with us in our success or failure, there was a lot of places in the country that had won the arms race [in facilities]. We didn't even enter them, because we had other things that were a pressing issue.\n\nQ: What do you think of the fan base who have been through a lot with Gophers basketball?\n\nA: With it being the only Division I school in the state those are the things we focused on in recruiting. That was a huge thing through a tough time that the fan base was truly loyal. Certainly, at the end they wanted a different coach in there, but they didn't quit being loyal to the program in itself. I always had tremendous respect for that fan base. To think they can get 13,000 and the lowest they've been is 9 or 10,000 in the last 30 years ... it's unbelievable with very little marketing and just loyal fans who just love Gophers basketball. As tough as times as they've had there, it's always stayed there. I think that's something that has really helped it not to be an SMU football situation, one of apathy it could've been for a long time for what those people went through and endured.","463":"Former Gophers cornerback Eric Murray garners $20.25 million deal in free agency A former Gophers player locked down a lucrative new deal in NFL free agency.\n\nEric Murray, who played for the Gophers from 2012-15, signed with the Houston Texans on a three-year deal worth up to $20.25 million, as ESPN's Adam Schefter reported Monday. The cornerback was a fourth-round pick from the Kansas City Chiefs in 2016 and played there for three seasons before the team traded him to the Cleveland Browns this past season.\n\nHe's played 54 games with 15 starts in the NFL, amassing an interception, eight pass break-ups, a fumble recovery, two sacks and 124 tackles.\n\nThe Wisconsin native was only a two-star recruit when Jerry Kill recruited him. Kill, defensive coordinator Tracy Claeys and defensive backs coach Jay Sawvel coached him into a three-year starter who played in every game of his career, earning multiple All-Big Ten honors.","464":"Former Gophers defensive end Bob Stein reacts to his induction to the College Football Hall of Fame Former Gophers defensive end Bob Stein became the 19th alum to make the College Football Hall of Fame a week ago.\n\nThe Minneapolis native and St. Louis Park High School product played for the Gophers from 1966-68, earning All-America honors two times. Cameras caught his live reaction to learning he was a hall of famer. You can watch the video below or click here.\n\n\"To get included in this group, I am humbled and honored,\" Stein said in the video, genuinely surprised and touched. \"It's one of the greatest things I can imagine in my life.\"\n\nWith the Gophers, Stein was a two-time All-Big Ten first team member and also played kicker. He went in the fifth round of the 1969 draft to Kansas City, going on to play eight seasons in the pros, including a Super Bowl championship in 1970 with the Chiefs.\n\nAfter football, Stein became the founding president and CEO of the Timberwolves and is now has his own law firm in Minneapolis.","465":"Former Gophers women's basketball star Rachel Banham traded to Lynx After four years of coming off the bench for the Connecticut Sun, Lynx coach Cheryl Reeve sees an expanded role for Rachel Banham in Minnesota. \"The opportunity is there,\" Banham said.\n\nAnother legendary University of Minnesota guard is coming home from Connecticut.\n\nThe Lynx acquired Rachel Banham in a sign-and-trade deal with the Connecticut Sun on Tuesday, a move that brings the Lakeville native back home and sends a second-round pick in the 2021 WNBA draft to the Sun.\n\nIt fulfills a dream Banham has had, frankly, since she was a fourth-grader.\n\n\"I always wanted to play for the Lynx one day,\" Banham said. \"I always watched them. I watched them become a huge franchise. It has always been on my mind.''\n\nBanham is the Gophers' career leading scorer -- just ahead of Lindsay Whalen -- and was a Big Ten Conference player of the year and an All-America. She was drafted fourth overall by Connecticut in the 2016 draft.\n\nShe joins a Lynx team needing outside shooting and help in the backcourt.\n\nLynx General Manager and coach Cheryl Reeve said the deal has been brewing for a while. The team had identified the 5-9 Banham as someone who could help them and knew Connecticut -- which made a big free-agency splash with the signing of DeWanna Bonner -- might be in a situation with their salary cap to make a deal.\n\n\"Timing is everything,'' Reeve said. \"And we didn't bring [Banham] home to have the same role she had in Connecticut. We think that role will grow.''\n\nIt's a homecoming story that, in some ways, mirrors that of Whalen's, another fourth overall pick who began her WNBA career in Connecticut.\n\nBanham, who signed a multiyear deal, will get a lot of opportunity with the Lynx.\n\n\"I had a lot of talks with Cheryl, and I asked her what my role would be,'' Banham said.\n\nThe answer: A combo guard who can shoot and score. A guard who needs the ball in her hands.\n\n\"I was so excited to hear that,'' Banham said. \"They're looking for guards. The opportunity is there. I'm in my home state. This all worked out for me.''\n\nShe appeared on 107 games in four years with the Sun, starting five, all in 2018.\n\nShe has career averages of 4.0 points, 1.0 rebounds and 1.0 assists in 11.4 minutes per game, shooting 36% from the field, including 33% from three-point range.\n\nOn a Connecticut team deep at guard, playing time was difficult to come by for Banham. Her best season was in 2018, when she appeared in 33 games, averaging 5.2 points and 1.5 assists.\n\nWith the Sun, she often came off the bench as an off-guard, catching and shooting more often than dribbling into her shot. She worked hard on that skill. But she is thrilled to get the chance to handle the ball more.\n\n\"That was always my role, growing up,'' she said. \"I was a point guard my entire life. I'm not the most traditional point guard. But I love to lead, love to pass. I'm a scoring guard, but I love passing.''\n\nBanham's history with the Gophers suggests that her shooting numbers will rise with more opportunity.\n\nBanham scored 3,093 points with the Gophers. Appearing in 144 games over five seasons -- she received a medical redshirt after tearing the ACL in her right knee early in the 2014-15 season -- she averaged 21.5 points in her college career, posting a 28.6-point average in her final season, second highest in the country.\n\nThat included a 60-point performance vs. Northwestern that season, a feat that drew the attention of former Lakers star Kobe Bryant, via Twitter.\n\nBryant tweeted at Banham after she hit a game-winner against Iowa a week later and the two eventually met when Banham attended a Lakers game.\n\nThe two formed a bond; the death of Bryant and his daughter, Gianna, in a helicopter crash in January hit Banham particularly hard.\n\nIn her Gophers career, Banham set school records in points, scoring average, games in double figures in scoring (134), games with 20 or more points (82), 30 or more points (23), and 40 or more points (three).\n\nShe is also first in school history with 354 three-pointers made and third in three-point shooting percentage (39.4). Overall, she made 43.3% of her shots.\n\nWith Danielle Robinson gone, Reeve knows she doesn't have a true point guard on the roster. So she's decided to go more with a \"lead guard'' concept.\n\nBanham and Lexi Brown figure to compete for time in that role. When training camp starts this spring, she and Banham will get to know each other better. Banham can't wait.\n\n\"I always knew I wanted to play for my home state,'' she said.","466":"Former Minneapolis budget director Don Siggelkow dies at 62 Siggelkow had an integral role in the acquisition of the Fort Snelling complex to build competition-quality athletic fields.\n\nAn article that appeared in the Star Tribune in February 1999 described the role of Minneapolis city budget director Don Siggelkow as \"the brake man in city budget deliberations with the mayor and the City Council.\"\n\nSiggelkow told the paper, \"We always have to balance tax policies and service demands.\"\n\nThat month, Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board Superintendent David Fisher, facing an accelerating demand for new athletic fields and other recreational opportunities for youths in the city, recruited Siggelkow to become the assistant superintendent for development with the Minneapolis Park Board.\n\nAfter serving for six years as the city budget director, Siggelkow accepted the job, which was focused on finding money to pay for programming, especially new youth initiatives. \"It's a recognition that it's an area that needs attention,\" he said at the time. \"We're going to look at new things we can do.\"\n\nSiggelkow, of St. Anthony, died of cancer Feb. 29. He was 62.\n\nOn March 4, the Minneapolis Park Board passed a resolution to honor Siggelkow's service to Minneapolis. \"Don was a leader, mentor, and friend to staff, colleagues and board members,\" it said. \"Don led a life that is worthy of emulation and recognition.\"\n\nSiggelkow was born on Oct. 29, 1957, in Duluth to Edwin and Sylvia Siggelkow. The family moved to St. Anthony in August 1967. He graduated from St. Anthony High School in 1976, earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Minnesota and a master's degree in public administration from Arizona State in 1984.\n\nHe began his career as a management analyst for the city of Glendale, Ariz., and served as the city budget director for Davenport, Iowa, before returning to Minneapolis.\n\nSiggelkow had an integral role in the acquisition of the Fort Snelling complex to build competition-quality athletic fields. He secured more than $3 million in Hennepin County Youth Sports Grants and developed numerous youth athletic fields, rinks and youth centers.\n\nAfter retiring in 2011, he served as a consultant to the Park Board for two years. He also started a company, Minnesota Partnerships, to bring more youth and recreational opportunity to communities outside of Minneapolis parks.\n\nSiggelkow also was instrumental in creating a land lease that provided the football facility at DeLaSalle High School on Nicollet Island. He also developed a plan that brought up-to-date fitness rooms and new playing surfaces to each of the Minneapolis high schools.\n\nIn 2014, he became the manager of Como Golf Course in St. Paul. He served as a partner in Foursome Golf Management Group, which privately operates Como and Phalen golf courses and Cozy's Pub at Como.\n\n\"He enjoyed working for Mayor Sharon Sayles Belton to carry out her initiatives,\" his son Zach Siggelkow said in an e-mail. \"I believe his favorite accomplishments were acquiring the Nieman Sports Complex at Fort Snelling and providing more opportunity for youth recreation in Minneapolis through helping the Minneapolis Public Schools receive grant money through Hennepin County for youth programs and facilities.\"\n\nHe also served as a St. Anthony-New Brighton school board member from 2008 to 2015.\n\nIn addition to his son, Siggelkow is survived by his wife, Helen; a daughter, Samantha; a brother, Roger Parrish-Siggelkow and two sisters, Midge Mogck and Julie Swedburg.","467":"Former Sparks GM Penny Toler files suit against WNBA team Former Los Angeles Sparks general manager Penny Toler is suing the WNBA team saying she was fired for raising complaints about inappropriate sexual relationships involving the team president and a managing partner, not for using a racial slur.\n\nThe Sparks say Toler was fired on Oct. 4 following a profanity-laced postgame tirade that included using a racial slur a few days earlier following a playoff game. In the suit filed Tuesday for gender discrimination, Toler said if she were a man, she would still be employed by the team.\n\nToler said her termination had more to do with retaliation \"after raising complaints about the workplace conduct\" of former team president Christine Simmons and team managing partner and governor Eric Holoman, \"who were engaged in an extra-marital affair\" during Simmons' tenure as team president -- a relationship Toler said made doing her job difficult.\n\nToler also states in the suit there was a double-standard for male employees, including the team's former coach from 2015-18 -- who was Brian Agler, though the suit doesn't mention Agler by name.\n\nWhen contacted Tuesday, Holoman said he was not aware of a lawsuit being filed. Neither Simmons nor Agler could immediately be reached Tuesday for comment.\n\nToler, who had been with the franchise as a player or GM since it was first founded in 1997, describes a soap-opera like atmosphere in the lawsuit that included sexual relationships between Simmons and a ball boy and the coach and a player.\n\n\"It looks like she was singled out and treated differently because she was a woman,\" Toler's lawyer Dawn Collins told The Associated Press, referring to Toler's postgame comments. \"Coaches speak to their players to get them fired up, many coaches use harsher language and far more controversial language. If the term is not OK, it's not OK for everyone.\"\n\nBut Toler said initially Holoman had publicly dismissed accounts he or Sparks players were offended by her language and that only later when the decision came under scrutiny that she was let go because of the outburst.\n\nIt is unclear who within the Sparks organization Toler registered her complaints with about the alleged Simmons-Holoman relationship. However, Toler said in the suit that even after Simmons left the organization in 2018 she had influence on decisions the team would make because of her personal relationship with Holoman. Toler said she was looking into trading Parker, but because Simmons and Parker were close Holoman wouldn't let her make a deal.\n\n\"I wasn't part of the clique,\" Toler told the AP. \"Every day people would have no idea what I went through here working for the Sparks after they were acquired by this ownership.\"\n\nShe said it was like walking a tightrope, trying to balance getting \"the team to win a championship while stepping on a minefield when I try to speak up when things weren't right.\"\n\nToler's executive assistant Angela Bryant, who worked for the GM from 2009-16, said that Simmons' relationship with Holoman \"was an open secret. It was like a joke.\n\n\"Everyone knew about it.\"\n\nToler said in the suit the inappropriate conduct was not limited to Simmons and Holoman.\n\nThe former GM said she confronted Simmons about another sexual relationship the team president was having with one of the Sparks ball boys, who lived with Bryant. Toler's assistant said she was aware of the relationship with the ball boy, who Bryant said was of legal age.\n\n\"I had a brief discussion with Christine\" about the relationship, Toler said. \"I was so embarrassed and told her I hope it stops. It's really putting us in a bad situation. The organization would face a backlash, but also the whole league in general.\"\n\nToler said she was treated differently than Sparks' male employees, including Agler. Toler said the former coach not only verbally abused players and was not disciplined for it, but also had a sexually inappropriate relationship with an unidentified player.\n\nToler said she asked Sparks management to investigate Agler's relationship with the player and was told by Holoman that he would handle it. -- but that no action was taken. She said she didn't hear anything about the allegations again until the league reached out to her in 2019.\n\nToler said the former coach's \"sexually predatory conduct caused certain Sparks players to complain that he made them uncomfortable, and compelled other Sparks players to leave the team altogether.\" Agler eventually resigned and is currently coaching Dallas.\n\nToler's contract was set to expire on March 31. She's had discussions for the last few months with the team about getting the pay she feels she's owed and to clear her name, but they didn't go anywhere. She didn't want to damage the reputation of the Sparks but said she was left with no other choice, leading to the legal action.","468":"Former Vikings DE Stephen Weatherly agrees to sign with Panthers The former 2016 seventh-round pick had carved out a role in the crowded Vikings defensive line, but found more money and likely more playing time in Carolina.\n\nThe first Vikings free agent agreed to sign elsewhere on Monday afternoon.\n\nDefensive end Stephen Weatherly agreed to a two-year, $12.5 million contract with the Carolina Panthers, according to his agency Institute For Athletes. The former 2016 seventh-round pick had carved out a role in the crowded Vikings defensive line, but found more money and likely more playing time in Carolina, where the Snellville, Ga. native is also a roughly four-hour drive from home.\n\nWeatherly, 25, started seven games for the Vikings, including during a six-game span for Everson Griffen in 2018. Aside from being a regular contributor on special teams, Weatherly had six sacks and a pass deflection in the past two years as a rotational defensive end.\n\nThe Vikings have 14 more unrestricted free agents, including defensive end Everson Griffen and cornerbacks Trae Waynes and Mackensie Alexander.","469":"Former Vikings safety Jayron Kearse agrees to sign with Detroit Lions Jayron Kearse, the versatile special teams contributor and safety, had been vocal about his desire to leave the Vikings in free agency.\n\nJayron Kearse, the versatile special teams contributor and safety, was vocal about his desire to leave the Vikings in free agency.\n\nThe 26-year-old Kearse got his wish early Thursday morning. Now he's scheduled to face his former team twice after agreeing with the Detroit Lions on a one-year deal. It's worth up to $2.75 million, according to NFL Media.\n\nKearse, a 2016 seventh-round pick, developed into a core player on coverage and return phases for the Vikings. He was a special teams captain last season until his Oct. 27 DUI arrest. The Vikings defense deployed Kearse, standing 6-foot-4, in a 'big nickel' package featuring him as the fifth defensive back in the red zone or against offenses with bigger targets. That's where he got two of his career-high three NFL starts last season.\n\nKearse is the fourth former Vikings player to agree with another team this week, joining cornerback Trae Waynes (Bengals), nose tackle Linval Joseph (Chargers) and defensive end Stephen Weatherly (Panthers).","470":"Former heavyweight boxing champion Shannon Briggs signs deal with Bare Knuckle FC Briggs is a former lineal heavyweight champion but has been retired since 2016\n\nThe Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship has added an aging heavyweight powerhouse to its roster with the announcement on Monday that the promotion has struck a deal with Shannon Briggs. Briggs is a former boxing heavyweight world champion and is also a one-time holder of the sport's lineal title.\n\nBriggs (60-6-1, 53 KOs), 48, is most famous for winning the lineal heavyweight title with a slightly controversial majority decision over George Foreman on November 1997, well after the aging Foreman had moved from his impressive late-career comeback to fighting lower-tier contenders. Briggs would lose his status as lineal champ one fight later when he was knocked out in five rounds by Lennox Lewis.\n\nBriggs would continue his career with mixed success until 2003 when he went on a string of 12 consecutive wins, all by knockout. That streak culminated in Briggs winning the WBO championship from Siarhei Liakhovich in November 2006. Again, he would be unable to successfully defend his title, losing a 2007 decision to Sultan Ibragimov.\n\nHe would earn two more cracks at a world championship in his career, first being roundly dominated by Vitali Klitschko in 2010. He was then booked to face Fres Oquendo for the then-vacant WBA title in 2017, but a failed drug test derailed the opportunity.\n\nBriggs has not fought since May 2016, but his power could make him a formidable force in the BKFC ranks.","471":"Four-star recruit Jamal Mashburn Jr. talks Gophers future and his senior season There isn't a coach Jamal Mashburn Jr. would rather play for in college than Richard Pitino. That's why the four-star Brewster Academy (N.H.) guard was excited to hear last week Pitino would be returning with the Gophers next season.\n\nMashburn and Pitino have a family history with their fathers teaming up as star player and coach at the University of Kentucky in the early 1990s.\n\nThe younger Mashburn, who earned first team All-New England Prep School Class AAA honors this year, is joined in the Gophers' 2020 recruiting class by four-star Chicago Heights Bloom forward Martice Mitchell.\n\nIn a Q&A with the Star Tribune recently, Mashburn shared his thoughts on this season for Pitino and the Gophers, his senior year being cut short by the virus crisis, his potential role as a freshman and more.\n\nQ: How were you affected by the Coronavirus cancellations in the world of sports last week?\n\nA: We were actually at the National Prep Showcase [in Connecticut]. We were in the championship game, but we had to call it quits. We were able to play two games before it was cancelled. We were named co-champions with Putnam Science Academy (Conn.). It was really good to play with the guys. We came together in the end. I'm sad we couldn't [play for the national title], because I know we could have won. Just those last two games being wins, I'm glad it ended on a positive note. Now, it's time to take the next step.\n\nQ: What was your senior season experience like with Brewster Academy?\n\nA: As far as the overall season, I felt like individually I did well. We obviously have a lot of guys who can do a lot of things on the floor. That's what Brewster is. We bring a lot of talented guys together. We try to get better competing against each other in practice. Just to get better is the main goal. Try to get better for the next level. Overall, it was a very good year. A very successful year.\n\nQ: What did you work on improving in your game the most this season?\n\nA: This year, I think my defense has taken a big leap. Being able to make certain reads and on and off the ball defense. Just reading the game, I've gotten a lot better. The game has slowed down for me, especially being a lead guard. That's something that I improved on.\n\nQ: From watching your games, it seems you were attacking the basket more this year. Was that your intent?\n\nA: Yeah. One of the things I wanted coming into this year was work on finishing better around the basket. Just playmaking. Those are things I can do, but people were kind of questioning. I just wanted to try to add more pieces to my game and bring it all together.\n\nQ: The Gophers had some big wins, but they also struggled in close games at the end this season. What are your thoughts on Pitino's team?\n\nA: I see a team with talent [and youth]. I've been around the guys for some time. I see that there's potential. There are things that can be done [to get better]. I'm going to come in and work my butt off, as I always do. I'm ready to get going. I see a coach who lets his players play with freedom. I'm just excited to get there. Really excited.\n\nQ: Sophomore point guard Marcus Carr had an All-Big Ten season. How do you think you'll play with him as a freshman?\n\nA: I've played with other great guards. I think we'll mix well together. It will be a pretty dangerous combo. Marcus is a hell of a player. I think it will be a great fit, especially because he needs another ball hander. He needs somebody else who can take the load off. We can play off each other. I think it will be very good.\n\nQ: What was your reaction when you heard that Pitino will be back with the Gophers next season?\n\nA: I'm excited. I had no question that they wouldn't bring him back. He's a great coach, a young coach and he has a young team. I'm excited, because he's the person I built a connection with at an early age in my recruiting process. He's a big part of why I'm going there. I wouldn't want any other coaching staff to be there. I'm really happy that he's going to be back next year.\n\nQ: How excited are you to try to help the Gophers get back to the NCAA tournament next season?\n\nA: I'm ecstatic. It's a dream to play in the NCAA tournament. Being in March Madness. I'm sad I couldn't see it this year [as a fan]. I'm excited for next year. Can't wait to get there.","472":"Free Online Resources for Remote Teaching Free Online Resources for Remote Teaching -- metamorworks\/istock\/Getty By Sarah Schwartz March 25, 2020 Printer-Friendly Email Article Reprints Comments\n\nEducation Week spoke with experts in curriculum evaluation and design, and consulted suggestions from teacher professional organizations.

Note: Ahead of free agency next week, when formal talks with other teams can begin March 16 before signings start March 18, we'll preview the reasons for and against re-signing the Vikings' top five unrestricted free agents and give you our projection.\n\nNo. 5: Will Vikings keep DE Stephen Weatherly in the plans?\n\nNo. 4: Did Mackensie Alexander play his way out of Minnesota?\n\nNo. 3: Cornerback Trae Waynes\n\nEven though Waynes' three seasons as a starter in Minnesota have been more solid than spectacular, the 11th overall pick in the 2015 draft heads into free agency as a potentially valuable commodity: a 27-year-old cornerback who's started in one of the NFL's premier defenses and possesses the kinds of athletic traits that might convince a team it's worth exploring whether he can take the next step. Waynes, who stands six feet tall and ran a 4.31-second 40-yard dash coming out of Michigan State, figures to have a market in free agency that could keep the cap-strapped Vikings from bringing him back on a new deal.\n\nPodcast: Left tackle Riley Reiff, Vikings approach crossroads\n\nReasons to re-sign\n\nThere's a significant level of uncertainty in the Vikings' secondary, with Mackensie Alexander and Anthony Harris heading into free agency, Mike Hughes recovering from a broken neck vertebra and Xavier Rhodes potentially moving on after a disappointing season that could make the 29-year-old a cap casualty. If the Vikings want to retain an established cover corner, it might make sense to pay Waynes, who doesn't turn 28 until July and made incremental improvements in coverage last season. He's established himself as a solid run defender, was penalized just once (after being flagged seven times the year before) and allowed a career-low 72.2 passer rating when he was targeted by opposing quarterbacks, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\nCoach Mike Zimmer works as closely with the Vikings' defensive backs as any position on the roster, and the team has undoubtedly seen enough by now to determine whether it wants to keep Waynes. The fact they're letting a 27-year-old corner get this close to free agency, after years of investing to keep their other young starters, says something, and Waynes might be interested in seeing what the market will bear for his services after playing five years in Minnesota. The fact he was the 11th pick in the draft meant he missed out on the more lucrative fifth-year bonuses available to the top 10 picks, and Waynes figures to have interest in maximizing what might be his best shot at a big contract.\n\nProjection\n\nUnless the Vikings clear up cap room and suddenly decide to make a generous multi-year offer to Waynes, the cornerback will sign elsewhere and get a fresh start with a new team. He heads into free agency with a marketable mix of experience, relative youth and athletic ability. Especially if there's a team out there convinced it can get more out of Waynes -- particularly as a cover corner -- the Vikings could decide to let their 2015 first-rounder walk after signing three members of that draft class to long-term deals.","474":"Free agents: DE Stephen Weatherly wants to stay, but will he fit Vikings' plans? Note: Ahead of free agency next week, when formal talks with other teams can begin March 16 before signings start March 18, we'll preview the reasons for and against re-signing the Vikings' top five unrestricted free agents and give you our projection.\n\nNo. 5: Defensive end Stephen Weatherly\n\nThe overhaul looming for the Vikings defense, which may see high-priced veterans Xavier Rhodes and Linval Joseph restructured or released this month, threatens to most affect the defensive line and secondary. Change may trickle down to the bench, where defensive end Stephen Weatherly became a shining example for younger players and a face of the Vikings' draft-and-develop philosophy. He's also a pending free agent.\n\nIf it were up to Weatherly, the 227th overall pick in the 2016 draft, he would re-sign before next Wednesday. But will the Vikings find the room for a worthwhile offer? The answer, regarding both playing time and available money, are likely factors for Weatherly and his representatives.\n\n\"I do have a second family here and it does feel like home,\" Weatherly said in December. \"To continue to play here would be outstanding.\"\n\nWeatherly has brought reliability on and off the field to the Vikings defensive line. His willingness to handle any assignment continued in Year 4 as he moved to an interior rusher on passing downs, taking him away from end where he thrived during six starts for Everson Griffen in 2018. While Weatherly didn't make his mark as an interior pass rusher, he's an underrated run defender whose 30 stops in the last two seasons weren't far behind Griffen's 37 despite fewer opportunities. He's also led the defensive line room in special teams snaps during two of the past three seasons. Off the field, Weatherly is considered a model teammate and is among the most charitable players with his time spent in the Twin Cities communities.\n\nReasons to move on\n\nHe's moving to his second NFL contract, inherently more expensive than a player's first. The cost to keep Weatherly compounds getting outplayed by Ifeadi Odenigbo during stretches of the regular season and playoffs. Odenigbo was told in his exit interview he's in the coaching staff's plans for a role in 2020. The Vikings also essentially control his rights for two more cheap seasons through $660,000 next fall and as an exclusive-rights free agent in 2021. So should the team re-sign Everson Griffen, as head coach Mike Zimmer said he wants, does a similar role remain for Weatherly? Or do the Vikings clear space for a new wave of talent?\n\nProjection\n\nWeatherly fits the Vikings' big picture: draft, develop and pay. There are many reasons to believe both sides can eventually agree on the details. He was still third on the team with 30 quarterback pressures last year and provides trusted depth. The projection here is Weatherly stays on a multi-year extension with room created by some high-priced defenders and other free agents being let go.","475":"Free agents: Vikings want Everson Griffen back, but he could have suitors in free agency Note: Ahead of free agency next week, when formal talks with other teams can begin March 16 before signings start March 18, we'll preview the reasons for and against re-signing the Vikings' top five unrestricted free agents and give you our projection.\n\nNo. 5: Will Vikings keep DE Stephen Weatherly in the plans?\n\nNo. 4: Did Mackensie Alexander play his way out of Minnesota?\n\nNo. 3: Trae Waynes hits the open market with a chance to cash in\n\nNo. 2: Defensive end Everson Griffen\n\nWhen Griffen restructured his contract last March, minutes before his 2019 base salary became guaranteed, he negotiated the right to void the final three years of his contract if he met playing time or sack thresholds during the season. Griffen reached both of those milestones in a productive season, and officially voided his contract last month to become a free agent for the first time in his career.\n\nAsked a day after the Vikings' playoff loss to San Francisco whether he wanted to return to Minnesota for an 11th season with the team, Griffen said, \"I want to be a Viking for life, but it's a business, so we'll figure that out when the time gets here.\"\n\nPodcast: The Vikings' defensive line could be in for some changes in 2020.\n\nReasons to re-sign\n\nAt the NFL combine last month, coach Mike Zimmer outlined a pitch to keep Griffen the Vikings had already begun privately before heading to Indianapolis. After missing five games in 2018 while receiving treatment for mental health issues, Griffen played 15 games in 2019, ranking 14th among NFL edge defenders with 66 pressures (according to Pro Football Focus) and resumed his role as a team captain whose voice carries plenty of weight with teammates. He'll turn 33 in December, but is still a formidable athlete who's developed great command of his skills. As Zimmer outlined at the combine, Griffen's longstanding relationship with co-defensive coordinator Andre Patterson could carry some weight, as does his ability to stay in the city where he's spent his entire NFL career and started a family. The Vikings' pitch to Griffen about staying in Minnesota has revolved around many of those themes.\n\nReasons to move on\n\nSeveral factors could ultimately lead Griffen to leave the Vikings after 10 seasons. If he's interested in testing his value -- albeit in a free agent market stocked with pass rushers -- Minnesota doesn't figure to be the place where he'll maximize it. How interested he is in exploring another team's culture, and how close he believes the Vikings are to Super Bowl contention, could ultimately determine his interest in taking what might be a below-market deal to stay -- especially if a team like Seattle (with Russell Wilson and Griffen's former college coach, Pete Carroll) or Buffalo (a young playoff team where former Vikings head coach Leslie Frazier is the defensive coordinator) can present some sense of familiarity. The Vikings also have Ifeadi Odenigbo, who's coming off a seven-sack season, and Stephen Weatherly (who's started in spots and proven to be a solid run defender in four years). If they decide to re-sign Weatherly and give Odenigbo more playing time, Griffen might be more of a luxury than a necessity. Especially if the Seahawks decide they can't afford Jadeveon Clowney, they could be the team to watch.\n\nProjection\n\nIt seems, this close to free agency, that Griffen will at least explore his options elsewhere and see if there's a good deal for him in a place like Seattle. If he ultimately returns to the Vikings, it could be because he doesn't find an offer to his liking on the open market and eventually decides during the second wave of free agency to sign with Minnesota for another year.","476":"Free agents: Vikings' Mackensie Alexander cleared; did he play his way out? Note: Ahead of free agency next week, when formal talks with other teams can begin March 16 before signings start March 18, we'll preview the reasons for and against re-signing the Vikings' top five unrestricted free agents and give you our projection.\n\nNo. 5: Will Vikings keep DE Stephen Weatherly in the plans?\n\nNo. 4: CB Mackensie Alexander\n\nMackensie Alexander could be headed elsewhere this month.\n\nThe Vikings' nickel cornerback is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent next week, when the 26-year-old will seek a big payday. Good news is Alexander has been medically cleared, a league source recently told the Star Tribune, following January knee surgery to trim his meniscus. It's unclear if the cap-strapped Vikings have yet made an offer to Alexander, but the organization is bracing for the possibility of replacing all three starting cornerbacks in 2020.\n\n\"If it is that way, then we just have to do a good job keeping guys in there and making sure they can play,\" head coach Mike Zimmer said at the NFL scouting combine on Feb. 26. \"We're not going to cry because we don't have some of those guys. Our job is to figure out how to get guys in there and get them to play.\"\n\nPodcast: Free-agency preview pt. 1 on WR options, C.J. Ham's restricted free agency and state of skill positions\n\nReasons to re-sign\n\nAfter rocky beginnings for the 2016 second-round pick, Alexander may have played his way out of Minnesota with a strong contract season ended abruptly. He missed both playoff games after he was one of a few primary contributors to play in the season finale loss to the Bears, doing so through the knee issue that ended his year prematurely. Only five NFL defenders played more than Alexander in slot coverage and allowed a stingier passer rating than the 85.7 on passes thrown his way. He may have been the NFL's best tackler from the slot. He led the Vikings with zero misses (an incredible jump after 15 whiffs in Years 2-3) and surrendered the fewest yards after the catch (94) among all slot corners in Weeks 1-16, according to Pro Football Focus, before playing through the knee injury against the Bears.\n\nReasons to move on\n\nAlexander was not happy he played the season finale in which most Vikings starters rested, a source with knowledge of the situation told the Star Tribune at the time, marking the latest difference between him and the coaching staff. Alexander's growth has been credited often by Zimmer when discussing how well in 2018 and 2019 he settled into the starting slot role -- a job Alexander initially fought with visions of starting outside. That confidence led to plays and could bring a decent payday. Last year's top free-agent slot corner, Justin Coleman, signed a four-year, $36 million with the Lions. Alexander has some competition, including pending free agents in Denver's Chris Harris Jr. and Pittsburgh's Mike Hilton, but it's likely his market will be too costly for the Vikings.\n\nProjection\n\nThe Vikings typically re-sign core players entering their second NFL contracts well before this point. So while Alexander's trajectory is promising, indications are his payday will come elsewhere. The projection here is Alexander moves on from the Vikings after four seasons.","477":"From Bon Iver to Badu, photos from the 2016 Eaux Claires fest Request to Vatican to investigate Archbishop Nienstedt in limbo Labeled a \"Return to the River,\" the festival led by Bon Iver frontman Justin Vernon took over a pastoral site overlooking the Chippewa River near Eau Claire, Wis., for the second year Aug. 12-13, 2016.","478":"From Chopped To Cake Boss, These Are The Best Food Shows On Hulu In May of 2019, it was officially announced that David Chang's Majordomo Media, Chrissy Teigen's Suit & Thai Productions, and Vox Media Studios had begun a multi-year partnership to develop and produce a slate of original food programming for Hulu.

But their paths make them inextricably linked.\n\nOnce every decade, the Lynx acquire a legendary former Gophers women's basketball guard entering the prime of her career - and they get her from Connecticut a handful of years after the Sun made her the No. 4 overall pick in the WNBA Draft.\n\nThey are two players whose styles are so distinct from one another that it really doesn't make much sense to compare them. But their paths make them inextricably linked to one another, with the latest uncanny twist coming Tuesday when Banham joined the Lynx via a sign-and-trade acquisition.\n\nIf you're a cynical type who thinks this was just a ploy to sell tickets to fans eager to see another homegrown player with the Lynx, here are two attempts to dispel that:\n\nFirst, for all of Whalen's appeal and for as long as Lynx fans had hoped for her return to Minnesota, average attendance only increased by 85 fans per game from 2009 to 2010 after she arrived. The Lynx missed the playoffs again that year, then won the draft lottery for Maya Moore. The real boost in crowds came in 2011 and beyond, when the Lynx started winning championships. That's generally what puts butts in seats on a consistent basis across all levels of sports.\n\nSecond, Banham can play. We know that from her time with the Gophers when she set the all-time program record with 3,093 points - including 28.6 ppg as a senior, a year that included a 60-point game.\n\nWe also know it from her 2018 WNBA season. She played just 12.8 minutes per game for Connecticut that season, but Banham made 37% of her three-pointers and put up huge advanced stats - including an offensive rating of 121.0 that was good for seventh in the entire league, just below Sue Bird and just above Diana Taurasi.\n\nShe followed that up with a disappointing 2019 season, which is likely part of the reason she was available - similar, again, to how Whalen had her best year with the Sun in 2008, dipped a little in 2009 and was traded that offseason to the Lynx.\n\nThe Lynx need the skills that Banham can provide, and she could use a fresh start with an increased role.\n\nWe shouldn't expect Banham to have the same impact as Whalen since winning four WNBA titles and a pair of Olympic gold medals is an unfair standard for anyone.\n\nThen again, Whalen hardly did all those things by herself. And Banham had as good a view as anyone of all that transpired with the Lynx while growing up in suburban Lakeville and later playing for the Gophers during the Lynx dynasty.\n\n\"I always wanted to play for the Lynx one day,'' Banham said. \"I always watched them. I watched them become a huge franchise. It has always been on my mind.''\n\nMaybe Banham, 26, can write a new chapter in her career and Lynx history.","480":"From the Archives: April 2020 \"Less than two weeks after a 40-foot wave flattened swaths of Southeast Asia, the United States slapped a new round of tariffs on India and Thailand.

Frost-free faucets are now required by the Minnesota State Plumbing Code.\n\nDuring one of my team's regular online discussions of building code requirements, plumber Joe discovered this little-known nugget in the 'new' Minnesota plumbing code. I say 'new' because this code has been around since 2015, but I don't think anyone happened to notice this requirement. We still see tons of new-construction homes with faucets that are not frost-free, especially on the walls of walkout basements.\n\nTo start, there are several terms for a frost-free faucet; frost-free, frost-proof, freeze-proof, and similar terms can be used interchangeably. Faucet, hose bibb, and sillcock are also terms that can be used interchangeably. It's a faucet that you shouldn't have to winterize because it has a big long stem that shuts off the water in the warm part of the house. Once the water is turned off it drains out, as shown below.\n\nHere's a nice cutaway view of this type of faucet, courtesy of the fine folks at Family Handyman.\n\nWhen a frost-free faucet isn't pitched properly, water won't drain out of the stem as intended. When this happens, even a frost-free faucet can experience freeze damage.\n\nBut watch out for these imposter frost-free faucets. They look exactly like a frost-free faucet, but they're not! The only way to tell the difference is to look up (or memorize) the model number.\n\nFor the record, this is a Woodford 101. It says so on the cap.\n\nSection 603.5.7 Outlets with Hose Attachments says the following (I added the underline): Potable water outlets with hose attachments, other than water heater drains, boiler drains, and clothes washer attachments, shall be protected by a nonremovable hose bibb-type backflow preventer, a nonremovable hose bibb-type vacuum breaker, or by an atmospheric vacuum breaker installed not less than 6 inches (152 mm) above the highest point of usage located on the discharge side of the last valve. In climates where freezing temperatures occur, a listed self-draining frost-proof hose bibb with an integral backflow preventer or vacuum breaker shall be used.\n\nMinnesota obviously qualifies as a climate where freezing temperatures occur. This is pretty clear. Frost-proof faucets shall be used. Just in case there's any question about what \"shall\" means, here's the definition in the plumbing code: Shall. Indicates a mandatory requirement.\n\nThe problem with a walkout basement is that frost-proof faucets typically have long stems that protrude into the living space. To get a typical frost-proof faucet with a relatively short 8\" stem, you'll have a water line hanging out in the middle of the room, as I found at this new-construction home last year.\n\nHow the heck is someone supposed to finish off this room? What happens when your kid tries to swing from the water line like Tarzan? This is why traditional, non-frost-free faucets are typically used at this location.\n\nI have some good news, however. A frost-free faucet with a 4\" stem will fit inside of a 2x6 wall, so there's really no excuse for a water line hanging in the middle of the room.\n\nOnce the word gets out, I predict a big increase in the sales of 4\" frost-free faucets. Home Depot, are you listening? Those things ought to be stocked on the shelves in Minnesota. You won't find them at Home Depot, Lowes, or Menards, however.\n\nIf I replace a traditional faucet, does this mean I have to install a frost-free faucet in its place? That's up to the Authority Having Jurisdiction, also known as the City Inspector. I spoke to the plumbing inspector in my city, and he said there's no way they'd force that on an existing home. But it is required for new installations, and they plan to start enforcing this requirement starting in 2020.","483":"Fstoppers Reviews the Fujifilm X-T200: All Touchscreen, (Almost) All The Fujifilm X-T200 looks like it swallowed an iPhone. With a screen size that matches that of a previous-generation iPhone 4, it might as well have. It's this screen that is the camera's most significant selling point, boldly signaling to smartphone users to put down their poor, small-sensor cameras to embrace this instead. It primarily works for its intended audience, with a few caveats.\n\nThe X-T200 sits squarely in the entry-level range of Fujifilm's X-series camera, slotting below the X-T30 and the X-T4 (to say nothing of the X-H1). Its entry-level origins can be seen in its use of a 24.2 MP APS-C CMOS sensor with a Bayer filter as opposed to the company's well-regarded X-Trans sensor that's used in its siblings above it in the range, as well as the lack of weather-sealing and control points. However, what it lacks in control points, it makes up for with easy-to-use touchscreen controls.\n\nThe spartan rear and top plates of the Fujifilm X-T200 don't feature a lot of buttons, but there sure is a lot of screen.\n\nLet's start with that screen. It's easily one of the best displays in any camera out there, period. It's a 2.7k-pixel, fully articulating 3.5\" screen with a 16:9 ratio. That 16:9 ratio makes the camera surprisingly useful for shooting video, more so than even the X-T30 I had an extensive amount of seat time with last year. There's an EVF as well, but it's a similar 2.36M-dot unit as the X-T30. Solid, but nothing to write home about, especially in light of the overachieving screen.\n\nWhile I talk more about how this camera compares to the very-close-in-price X-T30 later, if you're shooting video, mainly a vlog, with an X-series camera, the X-T200 jumps near the top of the list just because it's one of the few offerings with a fully articulating screen that lets you see yourself while shooting.\n\nHandling\n\nThe X-T200 is the first non-X-Trans sensor Fujifilm camera I've experienced, coming from an X100T, X-T1 that I still own and use almost daily, and an X-T30 and X-T3 I've used for extended periods. All have been enjoyable cameras. While the image quality differences between the different types of the sensor on this camera don't seem to be that vast, the user experience on a camera that's almost all screen is frustrating.\n\nThere are some highlights to the control points. As always, Fuji's control system sensibly places aperture on the ring of the lens, and there's a shutter speed dial encircling the release up top. There are two configurable buttons for exposure compensation and a customizable dial on the left that I turned into an ISO control. Unlike the X100F, X-T30, and X-T4, there's a mode dial where you'd expect shutter speeds to be. The problem with the customizable buttons and dials is that they're not labeled, and you can't know where you are at with ISO by looking at the dial itself if configured this way. You must rely on that screen.\n\nMore than that, I had one issue with the controls back when I looked at the X-T30, which was the incredibly tiny AF-lever that was a bit fiddly in usage. Sadly, Fuji made things worse on this model by including the same lever in an even more awkward position because of the large screen size. Oof.\n\nI was able to use the touchscreen to focus on the flower I wanted here, but I would have preferred using the AF-lever, if it weren't placed so poorly. Still, at this price point, it's nice to have one at all.\n\nPerhaps it's because the company expects most users to use the touchscreen to focus, but for photographers used to an AF-lever to control autofocus, it's a letdown.\n\nOther than that, the camera looks all-Fuji in its design -- handsome, with a good feel in the hand and quality metal\/plastic. No one will mistake this for a solid, weather-sealed X-T3, but considering its price point, it's a cut above other entry-level models.\n\nImage Quality\n\nThis many generations into its X-series cameras, there aren't any bad sensors in the range. I went back to look at the photos I got with the X-T30 last year, and while I prefer that model's grain and high-ISO noise performance, the truth is, I'm splitting hairs. The X-T200 comes close enough that image quality shouldn't be the deciding factor here when you're looking at Fuji models in this price range.\n\nImage quality and good color are strengths across the Fujifilm range. I was able to pull back blown highlights easily in this image of a rather large duck.\n\nLike other X-series cameras, the X-T200 comes with several popular films presets, such as Astia, Velvia, or my favorite, Classic Chrome. Also, again like other X-series cameras, it's one of the few camera brands I feel comfortable using JPEG files straight from the camera.\n\nIn short, it's all very X-like, which is to say it's consistently good.\n\nAutofocus\n\nThis is where the rubber meets the road here and also where the camera falters a bit. Autofocus is decent in a field where suitable isn't suitable anymore. After using Canon's EOS R and its excellent implementation of Eye-Detection autofocus, coming back to Fuji's system hybrid phase\/contrast system was a bit of a letdown. The system was easily confused by multiple faces, and once it picked up an eye, there's little else you can do to control what it focuses on. This would be fine if the system was actually fast enough to track an eye, but whereas the X-T30 seemed to at least work when there was a single person in the frame, the X-T200 was a bit inconsistent across the board when it came to eyes. Here are a few example frames where the camera should not have had trouble, but it did:\n\nThis is the amount of hunting it took over 10 seconds to get an image critically in focus with the camera's Eye-detection AF. It was generally inconsistent in being able to track eyes and worked better (for me at least) with the feature turned off.\n\nAfter a couple of weeks of trying, I ended up turning the feature off and getting better results with the standard autofocus that I could control with the (very small) AF lever. There's nothing particularly wrong with the autofocus here; it's just not up to the admittedly high standards set by its bigger brothers in the chain. Fuji's literature describes the camera's AF sensitivity as down to -2 EV, which is a lower spec than the X-T30, which should temper expectations. That said, the situation above was not a -2 EV situation.\n\nThe camera can shoot at eight fps, but with the AF situation being what it is, I didn't end up using continuous shooting that often.\n\nVideo\n\nThis is where I'd argue the camera makes the most significant case for itself. While the camera isn't rugged or feature-packed enough for professional filmmakers, everyone else will find the video features of the camera quite pleasing. I shot a bit of 4K video with the camera, and coming from someone who is used to the clarity and pleasant image quality of Panasonic Micro Four Thirds cameras, I'd say the footage out of this camera competes easily with those more video-centric cameras. Fuji makes the case that the better image quality comes from the camera shooting 6K footage and downsampling to 4K (3,840 x 2,160). Whatever magic is going on inside the camera, it works.\n\nOn the audio side, Fujifilm thoughtfully packs a USB-C to headphone adapter to monitor sound. There's a microphone input included as well, something that's often stripped out of more entry-level cameras. That said, audio quality from the built-in mic input was merely OK; I still found myself using a dedicated audio recorder for better quality audio.\n\nAutofocus for the video was not much better than stills, but if you pre-focus on what you're shooting, the results look good. The central portions of the video above were shot with the X-T200, to give you an idea of the quality.\n\nConclusion\n\nI struggled a bit with this camera. The image quality was decent. I loved the video out of the camera. Autofocus was frustrating, but no more so than my X100T, so it wasn't something that I wasn't used to. It wasn't until I read Chris Malcolm's piece about why he loved his Fujifilm X-T2 that I put my finger on it, or didn't, as the case may be. He wrote: \"...the design of the Fuji cameras simply reminded me of the joy of taking a photograph. It inspired me to try new things and new combinations. It made me want to take pictures for the love of the game.\"\n\nIt's then I realized why I still use my six-year-old Fujifilm X-T1 all the time and why I gravitated naturally toward the X100T, X-T30, and X-T3. That tactile, intuitive control scheme that just makes you want to pick up those cameras and shoot. That's what's missing from the X-T200. While it looks like a Fujifilm and takes pictures like an X-series camera, it doesn't feel like one.\n\nFuji's targeting a different market with this camera, and the large screen is the most significant cause for that. Smartphone users used to tapping their way to a photo will love it. Vloggers who need to see what they're shooting when the lens is pointed at them will love it.\n\nThe rest of us will spend the extra $200 and get the X-T30.\n\nWhat I Liked Everything about the screen -- it's big, beautiful, and fully articulating 4K video looks great USB-C port for in-camera charging or audio monitoring Well-thought-out touchscreen controls What I Didn't Like: Autofocus is a bit slower and less accurate than the competition Autofocus lever design is (still) terrible Tripod mount not centered with lens and blocks battery\/card door Mostly touchscreen-based controls are not for everyone Purchase\n\nYou can order the X-T200 here with a 15-45mm kit lens or body only.","484":"Fully booked Eric Newby, former travel editor of the Observer, became hooked on travellers' tales when he was eight.

And William replied, \"If I had been afraid I would not have come.\"); explorers in search of Hy Brasil, enchanted island of the west; pilgrims, or persons hounded from society such as Valentine Baker, dismissed from the army for having behaved improperly in a first-class railway carriage, later to become a Turkish general; or people escaping their creditors, or winter in Boston; or simply people with one-way tickets, such as the Israelites on the way out of Egypt, and refugees from Bosnia and all those millions who populated the United States. Or those of whom Evelyn Waugh wrote in the introduction to a book of mine (A Short Walk) who travel \"to satisfy the longing, romantic, reasonless which lies deep in the hearts of most Englishmen and women to shun the celebrated spectacles of the tourist and without any concern with science and politics or commerce, simply to set their feet where few civilised feet have trod\".\n\nAnother reason why the travel book may continue in popularity is that in many parts of the world travel has become too dangerous to take part in, except vicariously.\n\nIn Bogota, for instance, described in one brochure as \"a city of cultured elegance\", many of the inhabitants slice the bottoms off visitors' sleeping bags while the occupants are asleep in order to relieve them of their valuables which they presume, usually correctly, to be down where their toes ought to be, that is if they haven't already cut them off.\n\nI became hooked on my first travel book when I was eight years old and had never been out of England, apart from a visit to the Channel Islands - Arthur Mee's Children's Colour Book of Lands and Peoples, six volumes of it (out of print).\n\nIt introduced me to a world I had not seen, most of which I was never going to see, much of it a world that was no more. In it, in the \"Land of the Cymru\", Welsh dames still wore chimney-pot hats; little boys on Aran, part of the \"Ernes Isle\", still wore skirts to protect them from the fairies; Czechs and Slovaks and Hungarians were dressed in petticoats and amazing hats, while Kirghiz tribesmen stood on the \"Roof of the World\" and so on. The World of Arthur Mee looked a wonderful one to me.\n\nAnother favourite travel book was Travel and Adventure in Many Lands by Cecil Gosling - published by Methuen, 1926 (out of print - formerly His Majesty's Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Republic of Bolivia, a present from my father on my ninth birthday.\n\nIt was heady stuff. In the course of his journeys the author had encounters with robbers, hordes of wild pigs with razor-sharp tusks, vampire bats, horrible hairy spiders and, most terrifying of all, although he didn't actually have contact with it, the Paraguayan piranha fish.\n\n\"A friend of mine,\" he wrote, \"was attacked by a shoal of them while bathing in such a manner that he swam back to the spot where his clothes were, picked up his revolver and blew his brains out.\" About seven years were to pass before I understood why.\n\nAmong other, well-thumbed books was The Happy Traveller: A Book for Poor Men by Frank Tatchell, Vicar of Midhurst, London, 1923 (out of print). The vicar must have been a frequent absentee from his parish in the 1920s, if his marvellous book is anything to go by. It is full of curious information on everything from dealing with a mad dog to playing the tramp in England - \"The law is you must not sleep within 15 yards of the crown of the road - there are few beds more comfortable than a dry ditch in England in June. To play the tramp wear a blue handkerchief with white spots, wear a silver ring, let your nails get dirty and address an old man as 'Old Gentleman' and a woman as 'Missis'.\"\n\nIn foreign parts things got more exciting. \"An elephant has a dislike to a white man approaching him from behind . . . camels can give a violent sneeze of half-masticated cud . . . a llama has but one method of attack or defence and that is to spit in your eye\"\n\nBest of the roving reads\n\nThis is a very personal choice and personal choices usually make other people see red. All of them were published before 1914. If one were to include anything after that, another 10 would be necessary.\n\nEothen by Alexander Kinglake, 1844 (Oxford University Press paperback, \u00a35.99)\n\nThe Levant in 1835. The author has an interview with the Pasha of Karagholookoldour, who is mad about engines - \"Whirr! whirr! all by wheels! whiz! whiz! all by steam!\" - and an encounter with another Englishman, on his way from India to Europe, in the Sinai Desert, in which they touch their hats to one another and go on their ways without a word, eventually both turning back, ashamed, to greet one another less formally.\n\nVisits to Monasteries in the Levant by the Hon Robert Curzon, 1849 (Century Travellers, 1983 - out of print)\n\nAs diverting as Eothen, but less well known. Curzon, a bibliophile, began travelling in search of manuscripts, some of them priceless, which were hidden, or lying rotting, or being disposed of as jam-pot covers in ancient monasteries. Sharp and witty observations of people, places and weird Abyssinian sects. Amazing account of riot of some 17,000 pilgrims in Church of Holy Sepulchre on Good Friday with mounds of bodies lying around Mount Calvary.\n\nTravels in West Africa by Mary Kingsley, 1897 (Dent paperback, 1992, \u00a34.50)\n\nDaughter of G H Kingsley, physician, naturalist, travel writer, etc. Self-educated at home in mechanics, chemistry, electricity, ethnography, anthropology. First visited West Africa, 1893. There collected beetles and freshwater fish, travelling through fearful swamps. Fell into a pit lined with spikes but saved by \"a good thick skirt\".\n\nJournal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile by John Hanning Speke, 1863 (Everyman's Library, no 50, 1969 - out of print)\n\n\"The roar of the waters, the thousands of passenger fish, leaping at the falls with all their might; the Wasoga and Waganda fishermen coming out in boats to take post on all the rocks with rod and hook, hippopotami and crocodiles lying sleepily on the water . . . made as interesting a picture as one could wish to see.\"\n\nTravels in Arabia Deserta by Charles M Doughty, 1888, 2 vols (Dover paperback, \u00a335.90 for both vols)\n\nOne of the greatest travel books of all time. As a Christian infidel Doughty lived for two years among the Bedouin, suffering great privation and in constant danger of losing his life. Doughty's 600,000 word epic is written in Elizabethan\/Chaucerian prose, but abridgements are available. Note Arabia has been well served by English speaking travellers. Among them Bertram Thomas, Arabia Felix (Cape, 1932, out of print) - the first European to cross the Empty Quarter, in 1930-31; Wilfred Thesiger's Arabian Sands (Longmans, 1959. Reprint Penguin paperback \u00a36.99, in which he makes the second and third crossings of it); and T E Lawrence's Seven Pillars of Wisdom (Cape 1935. Reprint Cape hardback \u00a316.99, Doubleday paperback \u00a38.99.)\n\nTravels in Asia and Africa 1325-1354 by Ibn Battuta. Translated and selected by H A R Gibb, 1929 (Routledge paperback, \u00a311.99)\n\nA Berber, born in Tangier, Ibn Battuta was the greatest traveller in the history of the world, given the facilities available at the time; visiting what are now 44 countries and travelling an estimated 75,000 miles, not taking detours - to Siberia for instance - into account and en route gathering and discarding wives, concubines and riches, and taking up official posts as the spirit moved him. His first journey lasted 24 years.\n\nTwo Years Before the Mast by Richard Henry Dana, 1840 (Everyman's Library, no 588 - Penguin paperback, \u00a35.99)\n\nDana, sent down for a term from Harvard, contracted measles which ruined his eyesight. In spite of this, and poor physique, he shipped as a foremast hand in a brig and was 150 days from New England to California via Cape Horn, working his way back to Boston in 137 days in 1834. \"A voice from the forecastle has hardly ever been heard,\" he wrote. This is it.\n\nJournal of a Tour of the Hebrides by James Boswell, 1785 (Heinemann, 1936 - Penguin paperback with Samuel Johnson's A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland, \u00a35.99)\n\nHis adventures in the North in 1773 with Doctor Johnson, who had 10 years earlier expressed the opinion that \"the noblest prospect a Scotsman ever sees is the high road that leads him to England\". And as he walked arm-in-arm with Boswell through malodorous Edinburgh, the Doctor grumbled in his ear, \"I can smell you in the dark.\"\n\nItalian Journey by J W Goethe, 1786-88, 1892 (Collins, 1962 - Penguin paperback, \u00a36.99)\n\nAlmost everything is marvellous, seen through the poet's eyes when he visited Italy at the age of 37 and subsequently: a close-up of Lady Hamilton in her prime, an eruption of Vesuvius, Rome, where he got drunk \"on the holy spirit of art, the memories of the ancient past and the sweet wine simultaneously.\"\n\nTravels with a Donkey in the Cevennes by R L Stevenson, 1879 (Everyman's Library, no 766, published by Oxford University Press in paperback with Selected Travel Writings, \u00a34.99)\n\nWandering among the pine and chestnut woods of the French Massif, parts of which are as primitive today as when he travelled through it, in company with Modestine, \"a diminutive she-ass, not much bigger than a dog, the colour of a mouse.\"\n\nThe Voyage of the Beagle by Charles Darwin, 1845 (Everyman's Library, no 104, Penguin paperback, \u00a36.99)\n\nAccount of the expedition to South America in 1831 that began his career as a naturalist. Erudite and fascinating. Some inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego coming on board \"mistook two or three of the officers . . . though adorned with large beards, for the ladies . . .\"\n\nThe Naturalist on the River Amazon by Henry Walter Bates, 1863 (Everyman's Library, no 446, 1969 - out of print)\n\nBates gave up working in a brewery at Burton-on-Trent to spend 12 years in the forests of South America. Filled with marvellous observations of birds, beasts, plants, insects and man, and the fantastic trees, \"50 to 60 feet in girth at the point where they become cylindrical, 100 feet to the lowest branch.\"\n\nAn Englishwoman in America by Isabella Bird, 1856 (Reprinted by Virago Press in paperback as A Lady's Life in the Rocky Mountains, 1992, \u00a37.99)\n\nTraveller extraordinary, author of almost a dozen books, the above her first. Made her first visit to America in 1854, when it was wild. Aged 42 she met Rocky Mountain Jim, \"a man any woman might love, but no sane woman would marry\". Easier to enumerate the places she didn't visit than the ones she did, in some of them setting up hospitals. Aged 70 she rode a huge black stallion to the Atlas Mountains and, in 1904, died peacefully in Edinburgh, in bed.\n\n\u00a9 Eric Newby, who was travel editor of the Observer from 1963 to 1973, was born in London in 1919. His first book, The Last Grain Race, was based on his pre-war voyage from Australia to Europe on a four-masted barque. He worked in the rag trade which inspired Something Wholesale. Other books include A Short Walk in the Hindu Kush and Slowly Down the Ganges. His main books are Picador paperbacks.","485":"Functional cooperation of the glycine synthase-reductase and Wood-Ljungdahl pathways for autotrophic growth of Clostridium drakei Edited by Largus T. Angenent, University of T\u00fcbingen, T\u00fcbingen, Germany, and accepted by Editorial Board Member Carl F. Nathan February 11, 2020 (received for review July 17, 2019)\n\nDespite sharing the first four reactions, coutilization of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (WLP) with the glycine synthase-reductase pathway (GSRP) and reductive glycine pathway (RGP) to fix C1 compounds has remained unknown. In this study, using Clostridium drakei, we elucidated the role of the GSRP and RGP in the presence of the WLP, via a genome-scale metabolic model, RNA-seq, C isotope-based metabolite-tracing experiments, biochemical assays, and heterologous expression. Overall, the data suggested the pathways are functional under autotrophic conditions. Along with the WLP, GSRP and RGP convert CO to glycine and then to acetyl-phosphate and serine, which then obtain ATP by producing acetate and operate with limited reducing power. This is a unique coutilization of the pathways under autotrophic conditions in acetogens.","486":"GIF - Cat Rolls Off The Table Funny GIF of a cat that slowly edges toward the edge of the table, and then falls off all of the suddenly.

Use gift cards now On Sept. 22 Smaaash go-carts at Mall of America abruptly closed its doors. Based in India, the company has no other U.S. locations and left no forwarding information on how to contact it. That left Randy Kraemer of Rosemount wondering if he had any recourse. \"I'm sitting on a $100 gift card,\" he said. \"How do I get a refund now that Smaaash@MOA is closed?\"\n\nThat's a question that consumers need to be asking about any unused gift card, especially as more retailers and restaurants close their doors without warning, leaving consumers with a worthless piece of plastic.\n\nWe all know we should redeem gift cards quickly, so why don't we? \"People don't keep them handy,\" said Shelley Hunter, a gift card expert at Giftcards.com. People should keep them next to the debit or credit cards they use most often or add them to their mobile wallet. \"If you don't want to carry them around, put them by your computer so they're available when you're shopping online,\" she said.\n\nFew consumers foresaw Smaaash's closing, even though scattered news reports mentioned that it was behind on payments to the Mall of America and the Minnesota Vikings. But retailers that have announced select store closings should put consumers on alert.\n\nRumors of Gander Mountain's bankruptcy started in March 2017 and people could still redeem its gift cards, but by May, the stores quit accepting them. Now almost 40 of 200 Gander Outdoors stores, which emerged from Gander Mountain's bankruptcy, are in the process of closing nationwide. The Eden Prairie and Bemidji stores will close soon.\n\nCreditRiskMonitor.com put Gander's parent company Camping World on a list of companies with a high chance of bankruptcy. Other retailers on the list? Christopher & Banks, J Crew, Neiman Marcus, J.C. Penney, Pier One and Rite Aid. Retailers with an elevated risk include Express, Francesca's, J. Jill, Container Store, Kirkland's, Sears, GNC, At Home and Build-A-Bear. Forever 21 recently filed for bankruptcy.\n\nEven retailers that aren't on a bankruptcy watch list close stores, including Lowe's, Walmart, Target, CVS and Walgreens, but Hunter said no gift card should collect dust in today's retail climate.\n\nRestaurants are no different. National chains that have closed locations in 2019 include Famous Dave's, Applebee's, Noodles, Tim Hortons, Papa John's and Subway. Locally, Libertine, Revolution Hall, It's Greek to Me, Sporty's Pub & Grill and Corner Table have closed.\n\nThis year Boston Market closed its last Twin Cities locations in Bloomington and Roseville, leaving gift card holders stranded. When a company still has locations open in other cities, consumers can trying selling theirs for a discount on sites such as Giftcardgranny, Cardpool and Raise.\n\nHolders of Smaaash gift cards can email info@mallofamerica for a refund. Kraemer said he got a response from MOA and Smaaash should be issuing his check soon. For retailers or restaurants that have already closed, Consumer Reports said it's difficult to collect. It's better to use a gift card before a troubled retailer such as Sears or Camping World (Gander Outdoors) starts a company-wide liquidation. \"Some people want to wait until the liquidation starts to max out the savings, but gift cards are often not accepted once the liquidation starts,\" Hunter said.\n\nWith the holidays approaching, redeeming gift cards now is a sound strategy because many retailers and restaurants give up the ghost in December and January if holiday sales disappoint.\n\nFor those with a dusty Toys R Us gift card who are excited about the toy company's return during the holiday season, you're still out of luck, Hunter said. You can't use old cards at the new stores or website.","489":"Gear to Get Your Game Face on for Client Videoconferences | Fstoppers We all live in Zoom right now. With the global pandemic, chances are your client meetings aren't happening in person anymore. But while your photography gigs may have temporarily dried up, you still have to put your game face on, even if it's via videoconference. Here's some gear to help you do that.\n\nYou can be a wonderful photographer, but if you're negotiating with clients on a videoconference, showing up with bedhead and backlighting will be a major turnoff and could possibly cost you a job. After all, if you can't be bothered to think about how you look on a video call, what will they think of the care with which you will handle their photography needs?\n\nPhotographers should understand the basics that I cover in the video above: Light for your face, make sure you have a clean and\/or relevant background, and dress the part. Those are the obvious ones. But here's some of the gear behind the scenes that I used for the video that can add to the look for not a lot of money.\n\nFor lighting, while a window can work wonders, you can't always count on the right time of day for a call with a potential client. That's where the wonderful Yongnuo YN360 II LED Light Wand comes to the rescue. It can simulate that daylight color any time, and with the frosted glass, it makes for smooth, even light. You can switch color temperatures and even add RGB lighting if you want to use the wand as a lightsaber when this pandemic is over. I've also had some success with LumeCubes, something many photographers may already own, but for an even lower cost, the company markets a kit specifically aimed at improving your looks for video conferences. The kit includes a white and warming diffuser and mounts to computers or iPads with a suction cup.\n\nFor audio, while Apple's EarPods are ubiquitous, headphones aren't the most professional look for a call. For that, check out something like the Rode smartLav+, a lavalier that does wonders for your smartphone audio without the visibility of earbuds. That said, if you do decide to go the earbuds route, make sure you are using ones with the remote and mic unit built into the wire, which moves a higher-quality microphone closer to your face compared to earbuds without. I often accidentally use the standard EarPods that came with my iPod instead of my iPhone and don't realize that they don't have that built in. That said, one of my students entered a video conference with a Blue Yeti USB Microphone, and I was blown away by how good he sounded, even at a video conference, so there's that.\n\nWhat Kind of Computer Should You Use?\n\nI've alluded to it, but using your phone is probably a better call for a videoconference, at least in terms of appearance, unless of course you are using a PC with a high-quality webcam or a separate Full HD webcam. If you've got a MacBook, any MacBook, don't bother. Even the top models stop at 720p resolution, which isn't even full HD. By comparison, an older iPhone 8's selfie camera will have better results. You can see the results in the video, where I briefly switch to the MacBook pro from the iPhone 8 I was using in the rest of the video. As a bonus, this frees up your computer screen to look up prices, your calendar, or other information you may need on the call. If you're looking to go even higher quality, there are 4K cameras from brands such as Logitech, and while that kind of resolution may be overkill for a video conference, these external cameras bring with them more options compared to built-in cameras, such as the ability to change the field of view and adjust color and exposure settings. It's another thing to have to carry around, yes, but if you're sweating your image online, it just might be worth it.\n\nWith all that said, maybe you need a new computer to run all this gear. If you're all about videoconferencing, at least get a computer that can handle a \"virtual background\" if you need it. My MacBook Pro was purchased right before Apple launched quad-core processors across the lineup, and so its dual-core i5 processor can't (on paper) handle one of the features many people use in an attempt to look good. While most MacBooks across the range can handle this feature, which requires quad-core processors, there are still a couple that can't, including some base models of the new MacBook Air. If you're crafty, however, you can trick Zoom's software by telling it you have a green screen. However, it's something I'd strongly recommend against using if you're a photographer. No matter how good the photo you use for a background, it never quite looks real, and there's always a chance the software will screw things up and cut part of you off or include something you don't want to be seen:\n\n\"Virtual\" backgrounds are a tough sell if you're a photographer.\n\nYou don't want to leave your look to chance (and an algorithm that wipes out the background) when it comes to virtual face-to-face meetings with clients. Taking the time to set up a background will help sell you to your client and shows that you put some thought into what they're going to see. If you hate a blank wall (like I used in the video above) and you don't have any other options, there's always the possibility of purchasing a backdrop from a reputable shop like Lemondrop Backdrops. If you're intending to stick the backgrounds on the wall with gaffer's tape, go for their polylite material, which is light enough to stay up for a while this way.\n\nThese are just a few quick tips and tools to help improve your look for videoconference meetings. B&H Photo has an entire section dedicated to working from home, where you can do more to make the new office feel a bit better. Do you have tips of your own? Share them in the comments below.","490":"Gender-concordant identity documents and mental health among transgender adults in the USA: a cross-sectional study Transgender (trans) people experience profound mental health disparities compared with the general population, attributable in part to the psychological effects of gender non-affirmation. Despite the barriers to legal gender affirmation for trans people, little is known about its association with mental health. We therefore sought to determine whether having gender-concordant identity documents (IDs) is associated with mental health among trans adults in the USA. We hypothesised that having an ID that reflects one's preferred name and gender marker would be associated with reduced psychological distress and suicide risk.","491":"Gender-congruent government identification is crucial for gender affirmation Around the world, transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people experience striking disparities in mental health outcomes. TGD individuals are more likely to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, substance use disorders and suicidality compared to the wider population. These disparities are thought to be secondary to a range of factors including inadequate access to gender-affirming care, minority stress, and discriminatory public policies. Structural factors increase vulnerability among TGD people to discrimination and violence, limit educational and job opportunities, increase the likelihood of poverty, undermine housing stability, restrict access to health care, and contribute to social exclusion. Gender affirmation across legal, medical, surgical, psychological, and social domains appears in particular to have profound effects on the health outcomes of TGD individuals.","492":"General Mills recalls frozen green beans after listeria detected General Mills Inc. says it has recalled a \"limited quantity\" of Cascadian Farm frozen green beans after a package of the product tested positive for listeria.\n\nThe Golden Valley-based packaged food giant is the latest of several U.S. food companies to issue listeria-related recalls this year.\n\nNo illnesses have been reported in connection with the Cascadian Farm recall, General Mills said in a statement Wednesday. Listeria is a bacteria that causes listeriosis, a serious infection with symptoms including fever and gastrointestinal problems.\n\nGeneral Mills said the voluntary recall involves 10-ounce bags of Cascadian Farm Cut Green Beans with either of two \"better if used by dates\" stamped on the package: \"10APR2016\" and \"11APR2016.\" The recalled products were distributed nationwide.\n\nThe company didn't specify the quantity of the recall in pounds or packages. Cascadian Farm is a major brand in the organic food market.\n\nGeneral Mills said the recall \"is being issued as a precaution after one package of finished product tested positive for the presence of Listeria monocytogenes.\" The recalled product was produced and packaged over two days in March 2014.\n\nThe recall was issued after the Tennessee Department of Agriculture detected listeria in a package of Cascadian Farm green beans that was purchased from a retailer, according to General Mills. The company said it routinely checks for listeria at the plant level.\n\nListeriosis can be deadly, and strikes hard at pregnant women, newborns, older adults and people with weakened immune systems, according to the Centers for Disease Control. About 1,600 illnesses and 260 deaths are caused annually by listeriosis in the U.S.\n\nLast fall, four Minnesotans -- two of whom died -- were among at least 32 people nationwide who got listeriosis from eating caramel apples. The outbreak led to a large apple recall from a California packing company.\n\nEarlier this year, Texas-based Blue Bell ice cream shut down production for several months after listeria in its products was traced to 10 serious illnesses, including three deaths in Kansas.\n\nA routine test by Michigan food regulators in April found listeria in Sabra hummus -- a brand that's half-owned by PepsiCo -- sparking a recall of 30,000 cases. Also, California-based Amy's Kitchen recalled over 70,000 of its frozen meals after possibly receiving listeria-tainted spinach from a supplier. No illnesses were reported with either of those recalls.","493":"Genius or Insane? How Imperial Japan Wanted to Build Underwater Key point: Underwater carriers would have been impractical had they ever come to fruition. Like Nazi Germany's many wonder weapons, a lot of these plans were too little, too late.\n\nAs soon as Colonel James Doolittle's B-25 raid struck Japan in April 1942, Japan sought to wreak revenge on the United States, but by 1944 devastating aerial bombings on Japan by the Americans had become all too regular.\n\nIt was not until early 1945 that the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) was ready to strike America even further than it already had on December 7, 1941. After considering, then ruling out San Francisco, San Diego, New York City, and Washington, D.C. as targets, the IJN chiefs settled on America's vital Panama Canal. The plan to disable the canal--through which the United States was funneling military resources from the Atlantic to the Pacific without the long voyage around the southern tip of South America--had been the brainchild of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, the architect of Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.\n\nRecommended: Who Swallows North Korea after it Collapses?\n\nThe plans called for an aerial bombing by specially designed attack planes launched from surfaced submarines. Those submarines, the Sensuika, or I-400 Series, would be the largest submarines the world would see for decades to come. Loosely translated as \"Secret Attack Submarine,\" Sensuikan was shortened to Sen Toku.\n\nRecommended: US Army's 5 Most Lethal Weapons of War\n\nIn mid-1942, Yamamoto foresaw two things: how susceptible Japan would become to American aerial bombing and how Japan could reciprocate against American soil. From that he envisioned 18 huge submarines--basically underwater aircraft carriers--that could ferry attack bombers to their targets. Although Yamamoto's plan envisioned two planes per submarine to attack America's shoreline cities, in actuality each I-400 was designed to ferry three Aichi M6A Seiran \"Mountain Haze\" planes.\n\nRecommended: Russia's Armata Tank vs. America's M-1 Abrams - Who Wins?\n\nConstruction on the Sen Toku behemoths began on April 25, 1943, one week after Yamamoto was shot down and killed by American P-38s over Bougainville in the Solomons. But with Yamamoto's death and the fortunes of war turning against Japan, there was nobody to champion Yamamoto's dream.\n\nDelays plagued the project from the beginning. The I-400 prototype, built at Hiroshima Bay's Kure Navy Yard, was not commissioned until December 30, 1944, while both the I-401 and I-402 were laid down shortly thereafter at the Sasebo Navy Yard Docks at Nagasaki. Further, the naval construction facilities at Kure and Sasebo were often targeted by American planes but the damage was insignificant; the American bomber pilots had no knowledge of the giant submarines being built beneath them.\n\nOn January 8, 1945, the I-401 was commissioned and, six months later, on July 24, 1945, came the I-402. Once completed and out to sea, these vessels would become Submarine Division One.\n\nOf the planned 18 submarines, however, only three would be completed: the I-400, I-401, and I-402; numbers I-404 and I-405 were still under construction when the war ended in August 1945. The remaining proposed fleet of the I-Series--403 and 406-417--was scrapped before construction could begin. In their place came two new submarines--the I-13 and I-14--that were smaller but still held the same design aspirations.\n\nThe Sen Toku were beyond comprehension of any navy but that of Japan; they were 60 percent larger than any submarine America would put forth until the nuclear submarine age. The most important part of the I-400s were the planes they sequestered within their watertight forward hangars. Japan had long mastered the art of flying piggy-backed scouting planes off of their surfaced subs.\n\nThe sea beast I-400 series measured 400 feet long with a beam of 39 feet and a draft of 23 feet. It was a double-hull configuration that the Soviets would replicate 30 years later. It operated on four diesel engines of 7,700 horsepower with two electric motors as back up. The sub's surface tonnage was 5,223 tons; when submerged, it weighed 6,560 tons.\n\nPrior to their deployment, the I-400s had retractable snorkels fitted. When they were submerged for extensive periods, fresh air could be taken in while poisonous diesel exhaust fumes would be expelled. The sea-roaming range was a staggering 37,500 miles without refueling. Their fastest surface speed just topped 18 knots; submerged, the speed was reduced to 6.5 knots. The deepest they could safely dive was 330 feet.\n\nThe crew, which numbered from 140 to 220 sailors per sub, had the extravagant luxury of a walk-in freezer for storing their on-board rations. Still, potable water was limited to mealtime servings only, and latrine service was less accommodating, with just one \"head\" per boat available.\n\nThe I-400s were well armed. From their eight forward torpedoes tubes, 20 Type-95 torpedoes could be fired. On deck, three triple-barrel 25mm guns and one 25mm single-barrel gun were mounted. An even heavier gun--a 140mm\/5.5-incher--was also part of the armament.\n\nAnother unique application was a slide. Once ordered to clear the deck for a dive, sailors rushed the hatch of the conning tower. Jumping inside, they slid down a funnel onto a cushioned landing spot, thus cutting the time it took to clear the deck by more than half that of regular subs.\n\nIn appearance there was an oddity in the I-400s' structure. From the bow's view, the conning tower jutted off-center to the right. This was done to facilitate the 115-foot-long, 12-foot-wide, watertight aircraft hangar that housed the three attack floatplanes specially built by Aichi Aircraft Company of Nagoya just for the I-400 Series subs. Adjoining the hangar was an 80-foot-long pneumatic catapult.\n\nIn 1942 the Aichi company was put to work designing these floatplanes that became known as the M6A1 Seiran \"Mountain Haze.\" Each plane required a crew of two--a pilot and a gunner. The gunner faced rearward in the back seat and manned a 12.7mm Type-2 machine gun.\n\nTo save room in the subs' hangars, the plane's wings and tail had to be engineered to fold in along the fuselage. Instead of wheels, the Seirans came with two detachable floats. The bomb load came in varied combinations--two 551-pound bombs, one 1,764-pound bomb, or one 1,874-pound bomb. Once in flight, the Seiran could extend over 642 nautical miles\/739 standard miles.\n\nTo expedite launch preparation, portions of the planes' exteriors were coated with fluorescent paint, thus allowing the four-man teams readying the planes for flight to work in a minimum amount of light. Once the subs surfaced, a four-man deck crew could launch all three planes within 45 minutes. (After numerous delays, by July 1945, only 28 Seirans had come off the production line--16 short of the intended goal.)\n\nThe sole reason for the planes' existence: to attack mainland America. All that was needed now was a target. Various targets were considered: West Coast cities and even Washington, D.C., were discussed. The idea of attacking the Panama Canal was also considered.\n\nBefore attacks on any of those targets became operational, however, Vice Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa set forth the I-400's first mission. For its short existence, it was known as Operation PX, based on the achievements of Special Unit 731.\n\nSpecial Unit 731 was a large, permanent-structure complex established in Harbin, Manchuria, that was opened as soon as Japan gained control on the Asian mainland. The facility was disguised as a water-treatment plant, but its real purpose was to research the causes and effects of germ\/biological warfare. Their test subjects were thousands of civilian and military prisoners of war. (See the sidebar.)\n\nBy the early months of 1945, Japan was hell-bent on bringing some form of warfare upon America's citizenry. Ozawa's plan was to have the four subs of Sub Division One -- I-400, I-401, I-13, and I-14 -- sail for America's West Coast. Once in position they would launch their combined total of 10 Seirans with ceramic canister bombs filled with flea-bearing rodents infected with cholera, typhus, plague, and other pathogens designed to cause widespread illness in the United States. Previous attempts to launch such biological-warfare attacks on China had already been tried and found to be successful. The proposed target was San Diego, California.\n\nPlanning for the Panama Canal attack went forward. The birth of that plan came from two individuals with completely contradicting existences. One was a senior Japanese citizen who had once worked on the canal; he freely furnished to Japanese authorities hundreds of pages of personal notes, drafts, blueprints, and so on, that were in his possession.\n\nThe second source was less willing. He was an American soldier detained at the infamous Ofuna prisoner-of-war camp near Yokohama -- a site that became well known for its excessively brutal, torturous treatment of inmates. This inmate had been stationed at the Panama Canal at the war's outbreak. With that known to his captors, he was tortured and grilled for all he knew of the canal's defensive positions. He informed his interrogators that as the war progressed and Japan lost more and more ground, the attentiveness of those guarding the canal had dwindled by the time he left there.\n\nIt was easy, then, for the planners to move forward at that point. The ultimate Panama Canal target was its Gatun Locks.","494":"George Lucas Penned a New Animated Film Based on A Midsummer Night's Dream, Out Next January Called Strange Magic, the film stars Alan Cumming, Evan Rachel Wood, Kristin Chenowith, and Maya Rudolph, and is to be released on January 23, 2015.\n\nFrom the press release:\n\n\"Strange Magic,\" a new animated film from Lucasfilm Ltd., will be released by Touchstone Pictures on January 23, 2015. \"Strange Magic\" is a madcap fairy tale musical inspired by \"A Midsummer Night's Dream.\" Popular songs from the past six decades help tell the tale of a colorful cast of goblins, elves, fairies and imps, and their hilarious misadventures sparked by the battle over a powerful potion.

Here's a guide to how the law may affect you.\n\nWhat kind of emergency paid leave is the federal government offering right now?\n\nTwo kinds:\n\nSick leave, for up to 80 hours, at full or two-thirds pay depending on the situation. Family leave, for up to 10 additional weeks, at two-thirds pay.\n\nBoth will last through Dec. 31.\n\nI work at a large school district with more than 500 employees. Do employees in my school district qualify for federal paid leave?\n\nYes. All local and state government employees -- including teachers, administrators, staff, and other school employees -- are eligible.\n\nDoes federal paid leave cancel out sick leave I already have through my employer, or my union's collective-bargaining agreement?\n\nNo. Your employer may supplement your existing benefits with these provisions, or may provide additional sick or paid leave.\n\nI'm a salaried school employee. My school is closed for the foreseeable future. I'm not sick and I don't have children. Am I eligible for federal paid leave?\n\nNo. Only school employees who have COVID-19 symptoms, are self-quarantining or seeking a diagnosis, or are caring for family members or children whose schools or day cares are closed due to COVID-19 can take advantage of federal sick leave. Only school employees who have children at home, either sick or because their school or day care is shut down, can take advantage of federal paid family leave.\n\nI'm a salaried school employee, and I'm sick. I don't have children. What am I eligible for?\n\n80 hours of sick leave, paid at your normal salary rate, up to $511 per day.\n\nI'm a salaried school employee, I'm not sick and my child is sick. What am I eligible for?\n\nFederal sick leave and family medical leave. You'll get up to 80 hours of sick leave, paid at two-thirds of your normal salary rate, up to $200 per day. Then you'll get up to 10 weeks of family leave, paid at two-thirds of your normal salary rate.\n\nI'm a salaried employee. I'm not sick, and my child is not sick but is home from school due to the COVID-19 outbreak. What am I eligible for?\n\nFederal sick leave and family medical leave. You'll get up to 80 hours of sick leave, paid at two-thirds of your normal salary rate, up to $200 per day. Then you'll get up to 10 weeks of family leave, paid at two-thirds of your normal salary rate, as long as your child's school or day care remains closed.\n\nI'm a part-time, hourly school worker. Am I eligible for federal paid leave?\n\nYes. You are eligible in the same way as salaried full-time employees, except that one week of leave for you will consist of the number of hours you usually work in a single week.\n\nI'm a part-time, hourly school worker who works different hours depending on the week. How do I calculate my eligibility for federal paid leave?\n\nHourly workers with irregular schedules are eligible for paid leave for the average number of hours they work in a two-week period over the last six months.\n\nWho's paying for federal leave?\n\nYour employer will initially foot the bill, but the federal government will reimburse your employer within three months.\n\nSource: Education Week reporting and interview with Julia Martin, legislative director for Brustein & Manasevit, PLLC.","497":"Getting out to Shoot Does Not Always Require a Plan | Fstoppers If you stack too many requirements onto getting yourself to shoot, you may miss out on simply enjoying photography like you did when you started.\n\nIt rained on Sunday. It was one of those times when we were all out in the yard, and you could tell we had about two minutes before it was going to really come down. The wind began gusting and quickly brought in clouds to cover the blue skies. We got everything in the garage and sat on the front porch for the show.\n\nThe storm did not disappoint. The rain came down in buckets, and I had to fix a downspout on the fly much to the amusement of my onlooking six-year-old. We got a little wet watching, but the experience was well worth it. The sudden weather shift only lasted about 10 minutes. Just as The Itsy Bitsy Spider song says, the sun came out and dried up all the rain.\n\nAfter marveling at all the water droplets for a bit, I knew I had to go in and grab a camera. I had our Canon 70-200mm f\/2.8L IS II on, and although it wasn't perfect, we really don't have a macro lens, and I didn't want to mess with extension tubes. The sharpness and bokeh on that lens are the best out there, in my opinion. My wife and I shoot weddings together, and even though I may hate it after a long day because it is quite heavy, the shots always make it worth it.\n\nWhen shooting around the house or the yard, I am often just looking for interesting colors or light. None of the branches really stood out, but the depth and amount of water drops were making for some cool captures. It can be tricky to get the focus point you want, but the best part is that this is just free time shooting. There is no pressure to be perfect. I was just happy to have the camera out and slow things down a bit. It made me notice the great smell after rainfall. It had me inspecting my surroundings like I haven't in a while.\n\nPhotography has a real therapeutical way of getting everything else out of your head. I moved on from the tree I was on to some smaller details.\n\nI know there are much better water drop shots. But taking them was soothing. I have got to get me a macro so I can get shot as I've seen in the Fstoppers Mastering Macro tutorial.\n\nNext, I got very low and found a leaf with some water droplets that caught my eye. When editing, I couldn't decide if I like the monochrome or color version, so I made both. Again, not doing it for anyone or anything other than myself. If I wasn't writing about them, they would probably not see the light of day.\n\nAfter getting low, I made my way over to the driveway, where our new car was just begging to be photographed. I took a bunch of throwaway images but ended up liking a few, namely, the lead image and the Toyota logo below. Once again, I was just enjoying the process.\n\nI have taken some great photos with plans and some great photos without them. I have never taken a single great photo by talking myself out of shooting. Get out and use your gear. Even if you are confined to your room, pick up the camera, and make something. You are always running out of time, and excuses are the easy way out. Challenge yourself to shoot more, and you will learn what works and what doesn't. Your next favorite shot is waiting to be taken.","498":"Gish Jen, Laila Lalami to appear at Club Book The spring lineup for Club Book, the free author series that brings great writers to libraries in the suburbs and elsewhere outside of the central cities, has been announced.

An analyst by training, Ingraham had drawn up a comprehensive ranking of the most (and least) scenic and livable places in the United States. His findings saddled Red Lake Falls with the dubious title of Worst Place to Live. Outcry from dissenting Minnesotans surprised the author, as did an earnest invitation to visit Red Lake Falls and see for himself. This field trip set Ingraham down an improbable path that would eventually lead the journalist to relocate his family to the Red Lake area. Ingraham chronicles this journey of discovery, and self-discovery, in his new book If You Lived Here You'd Be Home By Now.\n\nBenjamin Percy\n\nAnoka County Library - Northtown | 711 County Road 10 NE, Blaine, MN, 55434\n\n7:00-8:00 p.m., Monday, May 4\n\nMinnesota's own Benjamin Percy is a master of many genres.

Writing it as the sports world has completely shut down around the world is even harder to believe.\n\nThere have been a lot of twists and turns in my career, but this has to be one of the unique moments in all of my years of covering sports.\n\nWhen I look back, I have worn many hats, not just as a columnist. And I would never have gotten a shot at the long career I've had without a lot of support.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that I got started in the circulation department of the Minneapolis Tribune in the 1920s, long before I was a sportswriter.\n\nThat was when I quit high school in 11th grade to take that job.\n\nA district manager at the Tribune by the name of Babe Bullis had taken a liking to me as a newspaper boy and hired me when they split the north Minneapolis neighborhood deliveries and gave me the Camden district to deliver the Sunday and morning paper.\n\nAt the same time, I was the first guy to handle the boxes where they sold newspapers on street corners in that district. I had to get up at 4:30\u202fa.m. to fill the boxes with newspapers.\n\nFurthermore they assigned the downtown area for me to distribute the Minneapolis Times newspaper to hotels and places like that.\n\nI sold papers on the corner of 5th Street and Nicollet Avenue and 6th and Nicollet with newsstands, and I had a number of papers I delivered to businesses downtown.\n\nI also sold the Sunday paper -- the Saturday night edition -- on 5th and Hennepin and worked from 7 p.m. Saturday night until 3 a.m. Sunday. They called that the 3 a.m. streetcar lineup.\n\nIn fact, there was a Minneapolis patrolman by the name of Nathaniel Johnson who was in charge of making sure youngsters working downtown were licensed. But since I wasn't 12 years old at the time, he kept on trying to stop me from working.\n\nLuckily, the bosses at the Tribune liked me and helped me keep that job.\n\nMy dad, Jack, delivered furniture during the Depression and made only $12 per week and we struggled. We had chicken for dinner every night. That was all we could afford.\n\nOne of the reasons I started working for the newspaper at such a young age was because it helped my family have extra money at that time.\n\nIn 1941, John Cowles, who had bought the Minneapolis Star in 1935 and the Journal in 1939, changed everything. He\u202fbought the Tribune in April 1941 and changed the Times-Tribune to just the Minneapolis Times, which Cowles kept as an afternoon newspaper after the Star-Journal merged.\n\nThere was a man by the name of Louie Mohs who ran the circulation department for the Times and recommended me to Dick Cullum, the Times' sports editor.\n\nMohs told Cullum that he should hire me as a part-time sports editor. The fact is, I had already met Cullum when I was a 12- or 13-year-old newsboy, and that was one of the reasons he hired me.\n\nSo I worked a combination of jobs -- I was still distributing papers while also working on the paper itself. My first assignment was covering St.\u202fThomas, and then I got my first column in the Times for Cullum covering the University of Minnesota, and I covered it from then on.\n\nI had also met Charlie Johnson when I was a newsboy and spent time at the Minneapolis Star, where Johnson was sports editor. He took a liking to me. I had dinner at his house many times, and Johnson got me a job on the morning Tribune.\n\nThat was a big moment in my career, because Cowles shut down the Times in 1947, when I was working my sports run and doing my first sportswriting job.\n\nBut the second that Johnson got word that I was looking out of a job, he called and offered me a spot at the Tribune covering the Gophers beat.\n\nEventually I became sports editor of the Tribune and then started my weekly sports column.\n\nThe fact is that without the help of Cullum and Johnson, I never would have had this kind of career covering sports in Minnesota.\n\nI believe a lot of my work ethic came from those early days when I was working multiple jobs for the paper and when I really made my name as a reporter.\n\nI have followed the advice that if you love what you do, you never work a day in your life. Even at 100 I can say I still love what I do.\n\n* Bob Stein was one of the greatest Gophers football players of all time, so it's fitting he will join the College Football Hall of Fame after being selected for induction this past week. The former All-America linebacker also played eight seasons in the NFL, including one with the Vikings.\n\n* The Vikings' decision to release defensive tackle Linval Joseph and cornerback Xavier Rhodes gives the team $19.3\u202fmillion in salary cap space, the fifth-lowest number in the NFL, with 47 players on the active roster.\n\n* Vikings safety Anthony Harris could be a top target in free agency for Washington, according to ESPN. The Redskins have $61.9 million in cap space.\n\n* It's a shame that the Gophers baseball team might have seen the last of Max Meyer, who might be the team's best pitcher in a decade. His 15 strikeouts vs. Utah on March 6 was the most for the program since Glen Perkins struck out 15 in 2004. Meyer's 46 strikeouts through four games finished tied for fifth in college baseball.\n\n* The Timberwolves' biggest steal in all their trades this season might be Malik Beasley, the 23-year-old shooting guard out of Florida State. He has averaged 20.7 points in 14 starts with the Wolves after averaging 7.9 points in 41 games for the Nuggets.\n\n* Before the break in play, the Wolves ranked last in the NBA in attendance at 15,066 per home game. They averaged 15,305 last season, ranking 28th in the league.\n\n* When play resumes, you have to wonder if Twins prospect Alex Kirilloff will get a shot with the big-league club after hitting .429 with two homers and two doubles in 10 spring games. Only Nelson Cruz posted a higher average for players who played at least five games.\n\n* Pro Football Focus sees Gophers wideout Tyler Johnson going to the Jets in the second round of the NFL draft. That would reunite him with college teammate Blake Cashman.","500":"Glacial erosion: status and outlook | Annals of Glaciology | Cambridge Core Glacier-erosion rates range across orders of magnitude, and much of this variation cannot be attributed to basal sliding rates. Subglacial till acts as lubricating 'fault gouge' or 'sawdust', and must be removed for rapid subglacial bedrock erosion. Such erosion occurs especially where and when moulin-fed streams access the bed and are unconstrained by supercooling or other processes. Streams also may directly erode bedrock, likely with strong time-evolution. Erosion is primarily by quarrying, aided by strong fluctuations in the water system driven by variable surface melt and by subglacial earthquakes. Debris-bed friction significantly affects abrasion, quarrying and general glacier flow. Frost heave drives cirque headwall erosion as winter cold air enters bergschrunds, creating temperature gradients to drive water flow along premelted films to growing ice lenses that fracture rock, and the glacier removes the resulting blocks. Recent subglacial bedrock erosion and sediment flux are in many cases much higher than long-term averages. Over glacial cycles, evolution of glacial-valley form feeds back strongly on erosion and deposition. Most of this is poorly quantified, with parts open to argument. Glacial erosion and interactions are important to tectonic and volcanic processes as well as climate and biogeochemical fluxes, motivating vigorous research.","501":"Glenn Maxwell Wears Ethnic Indian For Engagement To Vini Raman.

Raman also took to Instagram then to post a picture with the caption \"Last week my favourite person asked me to marry him #YES\".\n\nMaxwell had credited Vini Raman for being the first to ask him to speak to someone when he had taken a mental health break from cricket in October last year.\n\n\"It was actually my partner who suggested I speak to someone, she was the first one who noticed it, so I should probably thank her as well. Once I had that initial conversation it was a big weight off my shoulders,\" Maxwell had said.\n\nThe Australian credited Raman, who stood by him during his initial struggles with mental health.\n\n\"My girlfriend was probably No. 1, it wasn't an easy job for her to deal with me going through my mood swings for the first few weeks, but Michael Lloyd was the guy I had the initial conversation with, he's been someone who I've confided in since back in the academy days, so I've known him for well over a decade now.\"","502":"Global COVID-19 deaths pass 70,000; more nations emerge as hot spots As the pace of new illnesses and deaths showed more signs of easing in European hot spots such as Italy and Spain, United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson was admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) today following his hospitalization yesterday.\n\nLed mainly by ongoing heavy activity in the United States and Europe, the global total climbed to 1,341,907 today from 184 countries, including 74,169 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins online dashboard. The latest country to report its first case is South Sudan, which has a population of 11 million.\n\nAt today's WHO briefing, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, said the agency has been evaluating the wider use of medical and nonmedical masks for COVID-19 and today issued guidance and criteria to help countries decide whether to recommend them to the public. He said the WHO is worried that the use of medical masks in the general population could further shrink the supply of personal protective equipment for healthcare workers.\n\nTedros said that research on the use of nonmedical masks is limited. \"There is no black-or-white answer and no silver bullet,\" he said. \"Masks alone cannot stop the pandemic. Countries must continue to find, test, isolate, and treat every case and trace every contact.\"\n\nHowever, he said that countries could consider recommending nonmedical masks for settings in which handwashing and physical distancing are difficult, such as in cramped living conditions. If used, they should be worn safely and properly; the WHO offers advice on how to put on, take off, and dispose of masks. Tedros also suggested that countries considering masks for the general population study their effectiveness to better inform the rest of the world.\n\nAlso at the WHO telebriefing, entertainer Lady Gaga today announced a One World: Together at Home broadcast for April 18 to support the WHO and frontline healthcare workers. Organized by Global Citizen, a humanitarian organization, and curated by Lady Gaga, the event will feature appearances by an international line-up of musicians and comedians.\n\nIn Europe today, the two biggest hot spots -- Spain and Italy -- both reported more than 3,000 new cases, but both saw more signs of declining cases.\n\nIn Italy, health officials extended lockdowns until after Easter and are outlining what the next phase of the outbreak response might look like, Reuters reported.\n\nHealth minister Robert Speranza said it's too early to say when the lockdown will be lifted, but he envisioned a \"phase two\" in which restrictions could begin to be eased. Social distancing would remain, with wider use of protection such as face masks, and health systems would be better equipped to more quickly diagnose and manage COVID-19. Testing and contact tracing would be expanded, possibly with help from phone apps, and a network of hospitals would be reserved to treat those with COVID-19.\n\nMeanwhile, cases are still rising in other parts of Europe, including France, which reported 833 more deaths in hospitals and nursing homes, its highest 1-day fatality count, France 24 reported. Health minister Olivier Veran was quoted as saying that France has not reached the end of the epidemic's ascent.\n\nAnd Turkey, an emerging hot spot, reported 3,148 new cases today, giving it the sixth highest case total in Europe. Based on surging case numbers, the country announced strict new measures such as mandatory use of face masks on public transport, at markets, and in public spaces, according to a BBC report. However, the country hasn't announced a lockdown, despite calls from medical groups to do so.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who tested positive for the virus about 11 days ago, was moved to the ICU today due to worsening symptoms after he was hospitalized for persistent symptoms yesterday, according to a separate BBC report.\n\nJapan's Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, signaled today that he would declare a state of emergency as soon as tomorrow, due to expanding transmission and quickly rising case numbers in Tokyo, Kyodo News reported today. However, he said he isn't likely to order a lockdown.\n\nIn a related development, Japan's emergency measures are expected to include the stockpiling of the antiviral drug favipiravir, enough for 2 million people, Asahi Shimbun reported. The country's health ministry today reported 383 more cases, 5 of them from airport quarantine.\n\nElsewhere in Asia:\n\nIn India, where cases have quadrupled in a week, there are increasing reports that the outbreak is overwhelming the health system, with some older patients turned away from hospitals and halts to outpatient care threatening the treatment of tuberculosis patients, the Los Angeles Times reported. Today the country reported 489 more cases, raising its total to 4,778.","503":"Global analysis of LARP1 translation targets reveals tunable and dynamic features of 5' TOP motifs This article requires a subscription to view the full text. If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nThe mTORC1 signaling pathway senses nutrient signals and controls cell growth partly by regulating mRNA translation. 5' TOP motifs are defining features of mTORC1-regulated mRNAs, but their prevalence throughout the transcriptome and the mechanism that controls them are not fully understood. Here we show that the mTORC1 effector LARP1 is the master regulator of TOP mRNAs genome-wide. We discover features of TOP sequences that tune their regulatory potential across a continuous spectrum and define a metric called a TOPscore that quantifies them. Analysis of TOPscores across the transcriptomes of 16 mammalian tissues defines both constitutive TOP mRNAs and tissue-specific variants resulting from alternative transcription initiation. These results establish global principles of a dynamic and tunable program of nutrient-regulated gene expression.","504":"Global trends in antimicrobial use in food animals Antimicrobials are widely used for disease prevention and growth promotion in food animals. In the United States, antimicrobial use in food animals is estimated to account for \u223c80% of the nation's annual antimicrobial consumption (1), a significant fraction of which involves antimicrobials that are important in human medicine in the treatment of common infections and also necessary to perform medical procedures such as major surgeries, organ transplantation, and chemotherapy (2).\n\nThis widespread use of antimicrobials in livestock contributes--by means of natural selection--to the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARBs) and has significant public health implications: ARBs of animal origin can be transmitted to humans through the environment (3) and food products (4) and to agricultural workers by direct contact (5). Although direct causality is difficult to establish because of the ecological nature of antibiotic selection pressure, studies have shown a close association between the prevalence of livestock-associated ARBs in animals and in humans (6), as well as between the levels of antimicrobial use in animals at a population level, and the prevalence of ARBs in animals (7) and in humans (8). A recent study from seven European countries (Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Austria, Switzerland, The Netherlands, and Belgium) showed a strong correlation between consumption levels for eight classes of antimicrobials (9) and the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant commensal Escherichia coli in pigs, poultry, and cattle. Several works additionally suggested that repeated exposure to low doses of antimicrobial agents--the context in which growth-promoting antimicrobials and prophylactic are administered--creates ideal conditions for the emergence and spread of ARBs in animals (10).\n\nIn low- and middle-income countries, rising incomes have driven an unprecedented growth in demand for animal protein (11) and, as a result, the global biomass of animals raised for food now exceeds the global biomass of humans (12). In Asia, daily animal protein intake grew from 7 grams per capita per day to 25 grams per capita per day (12) between 1960 and 2013 while the proportion of the diet coming from rice and wheat progressively decreased, primarily among higher-income adults (13). To meet this demand, countries such as Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) have shifted toward highly cost-efficient and vertically integrated intensive livestock production systems. Because these production systems necessitate antimicrobials to keep animals healthy and maintain productivity, rising incomes in transitioning countries are effectively driving an increase in antimicrobial consumption and thereby antimicrobial resistance. Meanwhile, multiresistant ARBs have been isolated in food animals in BRICS countries (14, 15) and throughout the developing world where the use of antimicrobials for growth promotion remains largely unregulated (16).\n\nThe challenges of the nutritional transition to animal protein-based diets and the rise of antimicrobial resistance are thus closely linked: The use of antimicrobials as growth promoters and therapeutics to support the growing demand for meat is placing ever greater selection pressure for resistant strains of bacteria to evolve. Whereas trends in antibiotic consumption in humans are now being tracked in most high-income and some middle-income countries through databases on antibiotic sales (17, 18), antimicrobial consumption in livestock has received comparatively little attention. Expert opinion suggests that global consumption of antimicrobials in animals is twice that of humans (19). However, the underlying data from the veterinary sector supporting these claims are weak and lack standardization. Without reliable evidence to estimate global antimicrobial consumption in livestock, the links between antimicrobial consumption and resistance patterns are poorly quantified, and efforts and policies to optimize antibiotic use in animals are poorly targeted.\n\nThis study addresses these gaps in our understanding of antimicrobial use in animals. We use statistical models combining maps of livestock densities and reports of antimicrobial consumption in high-income countries to estimate and map the global consumption of antimicrobials in food animals for 2010. We then project antimicrobial consumption trends for the year 2030 based on growth projections of the consumption of livestock products.","505":"God of War Director Confirms Christianity is Part of the Series' World Even before God of War 2018 was revealed, fans mused about what pantheon of deities the god-killer could take on after wiping out essentially the entire Greek deific structure. Could he take on their Roman equivalents, gods that the planets are named for? What about exploring Egyptian mythology? Of course, we now know that Kratos moved on to the Norse\/Scandanavian realms, attempting to live out the remainder of his days in relative peace before trouble came knocking. But it begs the question: If the Greek and Norse pantheons exist within this same universe, what other religions and mythologies have laid down roots in Kratos' world? Cory Barlog has confirmed that Christianity is indeed a part of God of War's world, though that doesn't necessarily mean we'll ever see a Jesus and Kratos showdown.\n\nBarlog confirmed the information in a reply to a tweet asking him if Christianity was \"just another verse in God of War.\"\n\nBarlog's answer shouldn't really come as any surprise given that numerous hints in the God of War games indicate the presence of gods across many beliefs, religions, and mythologies. In fact, all the way back at the beginning of 2018, Barlog hinted that the team had explored ways to incorporate Christian beliefs into the game as far back as God of War II. Now it's confirmed that Kratos' world includes Christianity in some form, whether or not Kratos will ever come into direct contact with it.\n\nGiven Kratos' new direction in 2018's God of War, however, if Christianity is ever implemented into the games more directly than just vague hints and tweet confirmations, don't expect Kratos to start with the wanton murder of biblical figures. Rather, it could provide an interesting way to present biblical events like Noah's ark, Moses' parting of the Red Sea, David and Goliath, and even the rapture itself. While Christianity may not exactly have a wide pantheon of disposable gods, the bible is full of fascinating stories that could make for some epic backdrops for future Kratos adventures.\n\nMoreso, I think this is just Barlog leaving the door open and contextualizing Kratos' multi-denominational world, as opposed to him making any kind of confirmation that God of War is about to start ripping pages from the bible for the next game's script. God of War 2018's own story confirms that certain gods have traveled across to other realms and belief structures, so it's not surprising to learn that one of the biggest religious institutions in the world is represented to some degree within the God of War universe.","506":"Golden Goal: Georgi Kinkladze for Manchester City v Southampton (1996) | Sachin Nakrani Manchester City's history books are filled with the names of players who caught the eye and captured the imagination, from past heroes such as Colin Bell, Mike Summerbee and Dennis Tueart to modern superstars such as Yay Tour\u00e9, David Silva and Sergio Ag\u00fcero, but it's arguable none have left the club's followers in more of a dreamy state than Georgi Kinkladze. He was a source of joy in an era of severe decline, one which saw the club relegated twice in two years and left amid the muck and nettles of England's third tier. They were the worst of times but from 1995-1998 the fans at least had 'the Georgian Maradona', a midfielder whose impact was such that when he departed to Ajax, some of those who had watched him light up Maine Road simply could not let go. They had to see him, to speak to him, to sing about him, at least one more time.\n\n\"The Prestwich and Whitefield City supporters club branch had organised a trip over to Amsterdam to take in an Ajax game and invited Kinkladze to meet them in a bar on the Damstraat, which to everyone's surprise he did,\" remembers the football writer and City fan Simon Curtis. \"He turned up as casual as you like and spent the night playing pool and signing everything from clogs to beer bellies.\n\n\"I was living in Alkmaar at the time and remember sitting with Georgi on one of the pool tables chatting away about how much he missed City. He'd had various problems settling in at Ajax and things weren't working out for him very well. Meanwhile, the whole place was swamped by deafening songs of praise. It was a great night and showed the humility of the guy.\"\n\nLife at Ajax indeed proved difficult for Kinkladze. He joined for \u00a34.9m in the summer of 1998 and appeared a perfect fit for a club whose reputation was built around highly technical, creative footballers. But Kinkladze was unable to settle and flourish in his new surroundings. As David Winner outlines in Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football: \"Kinkladze didn't understand the Ajax system. He was baffled and alienated by the Dutch and their ugly, incomprehensible guttural language. Within a year he was utterly depressed, his only comfort watching videos with his countryman Shota Arveladze.\"\n\nIt was all a far cry from the sense of belonging Kinkladze felt at City having arrived in July 1995 during the first modern wave of deliciously talented foreign players into English football. Six months earlier Tony Yeboah had joined Leeds, while three months later Middlesbrough welcomed Juninho. Meanwhile at Tottenham, it had not been long since Ilie Dumitrescu and J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann had arrived and helped form Ossie Ardiles's wild and ultimately doomed 'famous five'. Then, of course, there was Dennis Bergkamp, who joined Arsenal in June 1995, and Eric Cantona, who by then was the king of Old Trafford. They were exciting, they were new, they had unusual sounding names and in the case of Kinkladze, appeared to have come out of nowhere.\n\nHe actually arrived from Dinamo Tbilisi for \u00a32m - via loan spells at FC Saarbr\u00fccken in Germany and Boca Juniors in Argentina - after being spotted by City's then-chairman Francis Lee. Given Kinkladze only left Tbilisi in the first place due to the civil war that ravaged Georgia after independence from the Soviet Union, it was perhaps no surprise he suffered homesickness after moving to Manchester. But the arrival of his mother, Khatuna, just before Christmas 1995 helped him settle in the city and thrive for his new team.\n\nHe was unspectacular in appearance - small and squat, baggy in shirt and scruffy in hair - but the signs that Kinkladze was a player blessed with incredible balance, skill, pace and purpose, had been evident before his mum landed, most consistently during a run of four wins and a draw in November. But it was what Kinkladze did against Southampton at Maine Road four months later that secured his status as a creative talent of the highest order and the new darling of the Kippax.\n\nIt is 16 March 1996, and in the 37th minute of a crucial encounter between two teams fighting for survival, City's No7 collects a pass from Steve Lomas just inside the opposition's half. He is close to the right-hand touchline and up against Simon Charlton. The Southampton full-back's body shape makes it clear that he wants to push Kinkladze wide, but the man in possession has other ideas and with a drop of the shoulder and a rapid shift in weight, he drives infield.\n\nThe home crowd roar in anticipation; they can feel something special is on. It doesn't appear that way, however, when Kinkladze reaches the edge of the area and as well as having to deal with Charlton grappling with his right shoulder in a desperate attempt to rescue the situation, is faced by two more players, not to mention the towering presence of Dave Beasant in the goal.\n\nCue the sexy bit.\n\nKinkladze skips past Ken Monkou with the ease of a man avoiding a piece of litter on the street and then once inside the Southampton area, does the same to the sprawling David Hughes, who rather strangely had run across Kinkladze in his initial attempt to halt the Georgian. With Beasant only to beat, he then dinks the ball over the goalkeeper and into the back of the net with his left foot.\n\nNine seconds from start to finish, four players beaten and one beautiful goal scored. \"It was impossibly impudent, impossibly cool headed,\" says Curtis, who was at Maine Road that Saturday afternoon. \"I remember the euphoria at seeing such a breathtaking goal and watching the little man run to the Platt Lane end beckoning, as if to say, 'come and join the celebrations'. It was a magical moment.\"\n\nTwo things in particular stand out about the goal. The first is the command of possession Kinkladze displayed. It's a clich\u00e9 to say the ball appeared stuck to his feet, but not once does it drift or deviate as he dribbles forward, holds off Charlton, glides inside Monkou and then around Hughes's legs. The control is magnetic and utterly remarkable.\n\nThe second is the finish. One-on-one with Beasant, it would have been easy for Kinkladze to simply smash the ball past the keeper, but instead he dummies to shoot twice and waits for the man in front of him to collapse on to his knees so he can lift the ball over him. His message to Beasant was clear: \"I'm going to make a dickhead out of you here, son.\"\n\nIt's often forgotten that Kinkladze beat the former England goalkeeper twice that day, with his first goal coming five minutes before the second via a tap-in from close range after Beasant had failed to hold on to Nigel Clough's shot. Paul Tisdale pulled one back for Southampton on 64 minutes but it proved to be a consolation and City ultimately secured victory in a match their manager, Alan Ball, had described prior to kick-off as the most important since his arrival from Southampton the previous summer.\n\nThe win moved City up to 15th but they still ended up going down in bizarre circumstances following a 2-2 draw with Liverpool on the final day of the season. In truth the campaign had been a disaster from the start, with the team failing to win any of their opening 11 fixtures and failing to convince thereafter. The only real highlight was Kinkladze, who in terms of raw talent was several levels above his team-mates. Quite frankly, seeing him play alongside the likes of Lomas, Garry Flitcroft and Ian Brightwell was akin to seeing Jimi Hendrix jam with Toploader.\n\n\"It didn't take long after Georgi arrived for us to recognise we had a naturally gifted footballer in our ranks. He was an out and out match winner,\" remembers Keith Curle, City's captain at the time. \"Off the pitch he was very shy, very unassuming, and someone who didn't enjoy the limelight. But on it he came alive. We used to call him 'Happy Feet' because he always seemed happiest when he had a ball at his feet.\n\n\"The goal against Southampton didn't surprise me because I'd seen Georgi do that type of thing in training all the time. In fact, he did it so regularly that after a while our defenders stopped committing to a challenge when he had the ball because they knew he could and would make a fool out of them. He had an ability to quickly change direction, exceptional vision and a wand of a left foot. And you saw all of that in that goal.\"\n\nCurle's affection for Kinkladze is obvious but he says there was also resentment within City's ranks regarding how the player was excused by Ball of any defensive duties, something which \"disrupted the ethos of a team built around 10 outfield players working hard for 90 minutes\".\n\n\"I remember losing away to Arsenal that season and one of the goals we conceded came because Georgi hadn't tracked a runner,\" adds Curle, currently the manager at Carlisle. \"The lads were not happy and some said as much to the manager after the game. In reply, he told them that if they were as talented as Georgi they wouldn't have to track back either.\n\n\"Alan adored Georgi and gave him the responsibility of being our matchwinner. He told him to not worry about defending and instead concentrate on finding space when the opposition had the ball and being prepared to attack once we won it back. He'd had a similar approach with Matt Le Tissier at Southampton and Matt flourished. Alan's feeling was that Georgi could do the same at City.\"\n\nAnd that he did, providing heavenly moments during a season of hell for City's supporters -as well as seeing their side relegated they also had to endure the sight of Manchester United winning a second Premier League and FA Cup double in two years. And their love for 'Kinky' was cemented after he decided to stay at the club, only leaving once they had endured yet another drop down the divisions.\n\n\"Kinkladze produced the same level of brilliance at the lower level, scoring marvellous goals at Oxford and Southend and a giant end to end slalom verses Leicester in the Cup that is still etched on the memory,\" adds Curtis. \"If only he had been around in today's City side. People would have recognised the true genius of Giorgi Kinkladze.\"\n\nIt is something of travesty that the midfielder's career tailed off after he left Maine Road. After struggling at Ajax he joined Derby County, first on loan and then on a long-term deal. But back in England Kinkladze could not recreate the magic of old, and following a spell at Rubin Kazan he retired in 2006.\n\nKinkladze could have become a great of European football. Ball, for one, was in doubt of his talents, describing him as \"the best player to ever come out of Eastern Europe\". But the Georgian will always have those three years at City, and in particular that goal against Southampton, when he gave a club on its knees a reason to stand tall and feel good about itself.\n\nAs Joe Royle, the City manager who sold Kinkladze to Ajax, put it in his autobiography: \"I wasn't blind to what lay behind our supporters' worship at the throne of King Kinky. In the long dark days at Maine Road he was a shining beacon who lit up the gloom with his flashes of genius.\"","507":"Golden goal: Paolo Di Canio for West Ham v Wimbledon (2000) | Jacob Steinberg If you came here looking for a brief recap of Paul Weiland's 2006 film, Sixty Six, then you are in luck. The story of a Jewish boy whose Shabbos spirit was dampened by his barmitzvah tragically falling on the same day as the World Cup final between England and West Germany in 1966 (spoiler alert: England win in controversial circumstances) was a niche topic that was met with mixed reviews, but it struck a resounding chord with me.\n\nHow I sympathised with poor Bernie Reubens's plight as he stepped in front of the congregation at his synagogue, knowing that he was going to miss the biggest match of his short life and that nothing could make the disappointment go away, because 13-year-old me had been in his position. I understood. I felt his pain. I was Bernie, Bernie was me, I was in a film with a 63% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the film was about me. \"Don't worry!\" I shouted at the television. \"Maybe one day you'll also get to write a needy, self-indulgent article in the Guardian about that time you missed a football match!\"\n\nAnd so, 15 difficult years on, here I am dealing with the trauma of my barmitzvah falling on the same weekend as a West Ham home game. And not just any game. A game against Egil Olsen's struggling Wimbledon. The big one.\n\nBut the barmitzvah was the bigger one. I performed it to rave reviews on Saturday morning, receiving a 93% approval rating on Mitzvah Matters (\"Has any boy ever hidden his reluctance about singing Ancient Hebrew text in public with such skill?\" one critic wrote), accepted the acclaim of family, friends and strangers with great dignity and then turned my thoughts to West Ham's match on the Sunday afternoon. Could my dad and I go to Upton Park for the 4pm kick-off and be back in time for my party in the evening? Would anyone notice if we were late? Would new loan signing Fredi Kanout\u00e9 be up to much?\n\nAll questions that were treated with frankly admirable disdain by my footballistically-challenged mum, so I sat in my room, got ready and listened to the match on the radio (Sky Sports would not enter our house until 7 March 2001). Curses!\n\nThen it happened. After eight minutes, Marc-Vivien Fo\u00e9 sprayed a pass out to Trevor Sinclair on the right wing. Sinclair took a touch, looked up and pinged a glorious crossfield ball from right to left, over Kenny Cunningham's head, and towards Paolo Di Canio, who was preparing something; he was up to mischief, a flick had switched in his mind and something special was about to happen. Di Canio was in the air as the ball reached him.\n\n\"Sinclair's cross,\" Martin Tyler told those who did have Sky, the interest in his voice rising. \"Over Cunningham's head. Di CanioOOOOHHHHHIDONOTBELIEVETHAT! That is sensational! Even by his standards!\"\n\nSomehow defying the laws of physics, Di Canio had managed to maintain his balance and lace a searing right-footed volley past Neil Sullivan from the left of the area and into the far corner. It was a goal that required absurd levels of technique, athleticism and skill, just the way that he managed to control the ball when he was off the ground, and the West Ham supporters responded to what they had just seen not with the usual cheering, but with what sounds like startled, baffled laughter.\n\n26,000 people shook their heads in disbelief in perfect unison and back at home, I shook mine in fury, silently fuming, honing my grudge-holding abilities. It had happened more than once that season; I never asked to be born.\n\nOn 11 September 1999, we missed Watford at home because it was Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. Di Canio scored the winner with a cheeky free-kick from a tight angle. On 18 December 1999, we missed a rollicking 4-2 defeat to Manchester United - Di Canio almost inspired a fightback from 3-0 down - because we had to go the birthday of a grown man who was wearing a novelty tie when he opened the door. This was less than ideal.\n\nAnother sore memory was school commitments ruling me out of the 1999\/2000 League Cup quarter-final that had to be replayed against Aston Villa after West Ham fielded a cup-tied player, Manny Omoyinmi, in the first match. My dad went and I fell asleep listening to the radio, shortly after Frank Lampard had given West Ham the lead.\n\nAn hour or two later, my dad woke me up. \"I'm back,\" he said. \"From the game.\"\n\nThe game that I wasn't at.\n\n\"Did we win?\" I said hopefully. \"Are we in the semi-finals?\"\n\n\"No!\" he chirped. \"They were winning 1-0, but Villa won 3-1 after extra-time.\"\n\nSilence.\n\n\"Di Canio had a penalty when it was 2-1,\" my dad continued, \"but David James saved it. Anyway, you'd better go back to sleep, you've got school in the morning. Night!\"\n\nVilla were back at Upton Park for a league match three days later. It finished 1-1, Ian Taylor scoring for what felt like the 1,000th time against West Ham that week, Di Canio hooking in a late equaliser after a mistake by James. Di Canio then landed himself in hot water for making an obscene gesture after the final whistle, later saying that he had directed it towards an unnamed Villa player who had called him a \"cheating Italian bastard\". It was never simple with him.\n\nAlthough some of his actions since that time mean my feelings towards him are now mixed, Di Canio meant everything back then. A few months earlier, our class had been told to make a short speech in assembly about a hero of the 20th century. Most of the choices were obvious - Nelson Mandela, Winston Churchill, Jamie Theakston - but when it was my turn to speak, the entire school was treated to five minutes on the spectacular magic of Paolo Di Canio. There were some odd looks.\n\nHero worship can be problematic. It makes perfect sense when you are a kid, but it can make you look tragically childish as an adult. From a moral perspective, it is difficult not to agonise over whether it is acceptable to laud a man who expressed admiration for Benito Mussolini in his autobiography (the first chapter is called 'Look at this beautiful, talented boy!' and the book ends with Di Canio's tiramisu recipe) and who has freely admitted that he is a fascist but not a racist. They say that you should never meet your heroes and even if you manage to do that, they are still liable to make a fascist salute after helping Lazio beat Roma in the Rome derby in 2005. Armed with that knowledge, it becomes easier, if a little gutwrenching, to remove the claret and blue glasses and view Di Canio in a different light.\n\nThen again, Larry David saw nothing wrong with whistling Wagner, even though it led to an accusation that he was a self-loathing Jew. Some people find it more palatable to separate the art from the artist and maybe football is supposed to be an escape, the place where grown adults can spend 90 minutes acting like children again, and it would be disingenuous to deny that Di Canio was a hugely talented player.\n\nHe was captivating for West Ham in the 1999-2000 season and most weeks his team-mates were relegated to the roles of interested bystanders as Di Canio went about putting out various fires - and sometimes starting a few along the way. It is a team game, but he was capable of winning matches on his own, which is why he would take all the corners and free-kicks and why he would sometimes appear in the right-back position demanding the ball, ready to take on every last member of the opposition. He even took throw-ins.\n\nHis ego was huge, of course, and he was far from perfect. Di Canio played for Giovanni Trapattoni's Juventus and Fabio Capello's Milan, but his book is full of anecdotes about various bust-ups with managers, which probably explains why he never played for Italy. He fell out so badly with Capello during a pre-season tour of the Far East in 1996 that his last words to his manager were: \"I'm not going to hang around here and look at your ugly penis face any longer!\"\n\nDi Canio was sold to Celtic, where he spent a season before joining Sheffield Wednesday. He struck up a partnership with another Italian forward, Benito Carbone, but his time at Hillsborough was brought to an abrupt end after his infamous push on Paul Alcock during Wednesday's 1-0 win over Arsenal in September 1998.\n\nAlcock's tumble earned Di Canio an 11-match ban and pariah status in England. However that merely brought out the wheeler-dealer in Harry Redknapp, who could not resist bringing Di Canio to Upton Park for \u00a31.5m in January 1999.\n\nRedknapp and Di Canio hit it off immediately and West Ham qualified for the Intertoto Cup after finishing fifth, securing their place in the Uefa Cup by beating Metz 3-2 on aggregate in the final. Metz won the first leg 1-0 at Upton Park, but Di Canio was inspired in the return leg in France, creating goals for Sinclair and Lampard.\n\nWest Ham were set for a season of terrifying lows, dizzying highs and creamy middles, with Di Canio at the centre of everything that was good, bad or indifferent about them. When he played well, they could beat anyone and, much like Dennis Bergkamp in 1997-98, he could have run his own goal of the season competition.\n\nHe cemented his place in West Ham folklore when Arsenal visited east London in October 1999. Arsenal had thumped West Ham 4-0 at Upton Park earlier that year, but this time they were facing Di Canio on a mission. It was one-way traffic for long periods and Davor Suker and Bergkamp had already missed a couple of presentable chances for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's side when Di Canio collected the ball on the halfway line, from where he proceeded to dribble his way through the Arsenal midfield thanks to a series of ricochets, favourable bounces and limp challenges. The ball squirted to Sinclair, who appeared to control it with his arm before dinking it over David Seaman and into the middle, where Paulo Wanchope's knockdown was turned in by Di Canio.\n\nArsenal laid siege to the West Ham goal in the second half, but Suker remained profligate and Bergkamp had a goal disallowed for a combination of handball and offside, before Wanchope flicked a long clearance from Shaka Hislop to Di Canio with 18 minutes left. It looked like Di Canio was heading down a dead end, but he turned past Martin Keown with his left foot and then cushioned a splendid shot high past Seaman with his right foot. \"Out! Of! Nothing!\" the BBC's Barry Davies yelped and Keown was later seen wandering around Green Street with a confused look on his face, asking for directions back to the stadium.\n\nWest Ham held on for a 2-1 victory that owed everything to Di Canio and two months later he could be seen mounting a one-man offensive on Manchester United. The champions had stormed into a 3-0 lead inside the first 20 minutes, but Di Canio dragged West Ham back into it with two goals, delighting Davies again by rounding the goalkeeper for his second - by the 52nd minute. Nine minutes later, he looked certain to score his first West Ham hat-trick when he ran through on goal again, only to mess up an attempted chip that was easily saved by Raymond van der Gouw. United countered, Dwight Yorke made it 4-2 and when the camera panned to Di Canio, he was beating himself up.\n\nYet there were so many moments to cherish: a stunning equaliser in a 1-1 draw with Derby County, a solo effort in a 3-1 win over Leicester City, a bullet off the inside of the post in a 5-0 win over Coventry City. Every week, there was something that took the breath away and West Ham struggled when Di Canio was missing. He was out with a hamstring injury when Everton won 4-0 at Upton Park.\n\nControversy was never far away and Di Canio regularly clashed with referees, claiming that they treated him unfairly. He was booked for diving after a blatant trip in the area by Middlesbrough's Gary Pallister and West Ham's 2-0 defeat to Steaua Bucharest in the second round of the Uefa Cup was marred by Di Canio's allegations that the referee, Claus Bo Larsen, had sworn at him. Di Canio was replaced by Joe Cole when West Ham were 1-0 down and it was later claimed that the referee had warned that he was going to send him off if Redknapp did not substitute him.\n\nDi Canio boiled over during a game against Bradford City in February 2000. West Ham were trailing 4-2 to Paul Jewell's strugglers and Di Canio's indignation at seeing another obvious penalty appeal turned down by the referee, Neale Barry, led to him sitting down by the side of the pitch and telling Redknapp to take him off. Meanwhile Dean Saunders was busy hitting the post up the other end, wasting the chance to make it 5-2 to Bradford, and Redknapp told Di Canio to get on with it.\n\nEventually he roused himself and when Paul Kitson won a penalty for West Ham, Di Canio spied his chance to redeem himself after the miss against Villa. One problem, however - Lampard had grabbed the ball and had decided that he was taking it. He was wrong. After a long, heated and reasonably one-sided debate, Lampard backed off, Di Canio scored and West Ham fought back to win 5-4. Lampard, teed up by Di Canio, scored the winner.\n\nThe Wimbledon game came six weeks later and let's let the man himself take us through his astonishing goal, writing in his autobiography:\n\n\"I got a lot of praise for the volley I scored against Wimbledon. Sure, it was a spectacular goal. What I did was extremely difficult, because it requires total body control, timing and balance. Compared to a bicycle kick or a scissors kick it is much more difficult, because in those situations your body weight is going backwards, which helps stabilise you. But when I struck the ball against Wimbledon, both feet were in the air, even just making contact was quite an achievement. But goals like that don't just come out of thin air. I was able to do it because it was something I had practised for hours and hours in training. I attempted it so many times that it became an instinctive gesture. As the cross came in, I didn't even think about what I was going to do. My brain just decided for me, it just happened.\"\n\nDi Canio was named West Ham's player of the season and his goal against Wimbledon won goal of the season. Few efforts can top it for sheer chutzpah and imagination.\n\nIt was at least two months before I saw it but I have since managed to find a DVD of the entire match and, in the absence of having an actual life, recently spent an afternoon watching it. Di Canio was great.\n\nBack on that March afternoon, my dad caught me on the stairs shortly after the final whistle. \"Apparently Di Canio scored a good goal,\" he said.","508":"Goodyear man who killed his wife in front of their children sentenced to 25 years in prison Court records say John was upset with one of his children for playing video games and struck the child in the face.

New York receiver Justin Bellido instead signed with Boston College while Georgia receiver Dakota Thomas has since visited Western Kentucky. The Gophers have one spot still open in their 25-man 2020 class ahead of the official National Signing Day on Wednesday, and Fleck could decide to fill that with a transfer sometime in the coming months.\n\nPerham native Logan Richter has grayshirted for the Gophers under Fleck, joining the team this past season after committing back in 2017. The defensive tackle early enrolled, like McGill plans to do, and redshirted 2019.\n\nMcGill would make six current 2021 commits for the Gophers.\n\nAlso, another Gophers player has entered the NCAA transfer portal, per a source.

This is the Gophers fifth defensive line coach in as many seasons.\n\nWilt previously coached D-line at Army West Point, Maryland, Ball State, Richmond, Virginia, Liberty and Central Connecticut State. But with the Bearcats in 2019, Wilt and the defense led the AAC in total defense, totaling 96 tackles for a loss and 31 sacks in an 11-win season. Cincinnati won the East division of its conference as well as their bowl game, finishing the season ranked No. 21.

If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nBinding of parathyroid hormone (PTH) to its cognate receptor (PTHR) has been shown to induce prolonged cAMP responses from early endosomes. While the receptor also couples to G, whether this pathway modulates sustained cAMP remains unexplored. Here, we show that lack of G activation reduces the duration of PTH-induced cAMP generation. Our findings reveal that this effect occurs at the level of the G protein, rather than downstream effectors, via provision of G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits at the cell surface. We demonstrate that G-derived G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits act in a phosphoinositide-3 kinase-dependent manner to promote assembly of ternary PTHR-\u03b2arrestin-G\u03b2\u03b3 complexes that are required for PTH-mediated sustained cAMP from endosomes.

Two turnovers: Fumbled away kickoff returns in the Week 11 win vs. Denver and Week 13 loss at Seattle.\n\n-One of 20 NFL teams without a returned touchdown on kickoffs or punts. Returners Abdullah, Hughes and Chad Beebe were unspectacular ranking 15th on kickoff returns and 20th on punt returns, collectively.\n\n-Kick coverage struggled. Did not surrender a touchdown, but allowed five returns of at least 30 yards to rank 27th (25.1 yards). That doesn't include the Saints' 54-yard return during the NFC wild-card playoff win in New Orleans.\n\n-Punt coverage improved after allowing 46 yards on four returns to Kenjon Barner in the season opener. Finished 12th (6.8 yards) in punt coverage, while Colquitt ranked sixth with a career-best average of 42.6 net yards.\n\nBelow we'll deliver 2019 grades for Vikings specialists, setting up the 2020 outlook.\n\nPreviously\n\nDalvin Cook's breakout sets up payday; will Vikings buy in?\n\nStefon Diggs, Kyle Rudolph adjusted to most change with Vikings\n\nOffensive line improved, but talent gap clear vs. NFC's best\n\nKirk Cousins delivers best season; will that mean $100 million?\n\nEric Kendricks' 2019 makes him one of NFL's best linebackers\n\nDanielle Hunter leads defensive line full of talent, questions\n\nAnthony Harris, Xavier Rhodes and the evolving secondary\n\nGrades are based on a 1-to-5 scale, with '5' marking excellence, '4' for above-average, '3' for average, '2' for below-average and '1' for failure to perform.

Below are individual grades, based on game and practice observations, weekly film reviews and interviews with coaches for three specialists who finished the season on the Vikings' active roster, injured reserve or practice squad .\n\nK Dan Bailey (4.0) -- Ninth-year NFL veteran had best season since his 2015 Pro Bowl campaign for the Cowboys. Made 23 consecutive field goals to end the season, including 4 of 4 in the playoffs. Tied career low with two missed field goals (27 of 29) in the regular season. Doubled career NFC Special Teams Player of the Week honors with three such awards after going 4 of 4 in wins against the Giants, Redskins and Chargers. Stabilized the kicking game after signing a one-year, $1 million last spring, setting up his first full season after being signed in Week 3 of the 2018 season. Doubled his salary by hitting $1 million worth of incentives for clearing 90% on field goals. Few could see this coming. Bailey's trusted process was engulfed in changes by last summer, starting with a new coordinator, newkicking coach Nate Kaedingand a rotation of long snappers and holders. Didn't have a perfect practice in training camp until the 14th of 16 days, so the Vikings sent a 2020 fifth-round pick to Baltimore for another option in Vedvik. Bailey responded by going 9 of 9 in preseason games to keep his job. Vedvik was released. Veteran punter Britton Colquitt was cut by the Browns and signed a week before the season opener to be Bailey's holder.\n\nFound a groove immediately, starting 8 of 10 on field goals without a miss since. Good for a long of 50 yards in three games against Oakland, Washington and Detroit. Went 40 of 44 on extra-point attempts [91%], with one blocked. \"Wasn't the only one who made a mistake,\" per head coach Mike Zimmer, on a miss in the Week 13 loss at Seattle. Career-high 75.9% touchback rate on kickoffs as the team's coverage struggled. Set up well for a multi-year contract extension after one-year deals in Minnesota for the past two seasons. Turned 32 last month. Pending free agent.\n\nP Britton Colquitt (4.0) -- The 11th-year NFL veteran was just released by the Browns when he was driving to Buffalo on Sept. 1 to sign with the Bills. His agent, Paul Sheehy, called with word from the Vikings, changing the course of Colquitt's trip and the team's fortune after cycling through holders last summer. Said he \"honestly had the best year of my career\" after a career-high 42.6 net yards on a career-low 62 punts during the regular season. Led the NFL with zero touchbacks while pinning 12 punts inside the opponents' 10-yard line. Too much leg during first touchback on opening, 57-yard punt in the NFC wild-card playoff win in New Orleans. Season-long, 59-yard punt came in Week 4 loss at Chicago, when gunner Kris Boyd's missed tackle led to a 16-yard return by Tarik Cohen. Low point came at the end of the loss in Kansas City, where Colquitt shanked a 27-yard punt from inside his own 10-yard line while the game was tied with 1:55 left. Said he was trying to kick it away from Chiefs star Tyreek Hill and it got away from him. A few plays later, the Vikings lost off a 44-yard field goal. Shanked another the following week in Dallas to midfield. Otherwise brought consistency as the fourth different Vikings punter in the past four seasons. Turns 35 in March. Pending free agent.\n\nLS Austin Cutting (3.0) -- Replaced incumbent long snapper Kevin McDermott after being draftedin the seventh round (250th overall) out of Air Force. Officially won the job on Aug. 11 when the team released McDermott to stabilize the field goal operation around Bailey. Appeared in 16 games without game-altering mistakes.","524":"Grading the Vikings: Danielle Hunter leads Vikings defensive line full of talent, questions After another strong season together, during which the Vikings ranked among the top five in sacks, unprecedented change may be on the horizon for the defensive line.\n\nEmotions overflowed after the Vikings' NFC Divisional playoff loss in San Francisco, where inside the visiting locker room at Levi's Stadium defensive end Everson Griffen cut short his media availability amid an answer about moving forward. Minutes later, the stoic star Danielle Hunter became emotional when asked about Griffen's impact across their five seasons together.\n\n\"He's been everything to me,\" Hunter said. \"He's a big part of the player I am today. He means a lot to me.\"\n\nFor much of six seasons under head coach Mike Zimmer, the Vikings defensive line has anchored defensive success with core players including Griffen and Linval Joseph. After another strong campaign together, during which the Vikings ranked top five in sacks, unprecedented change may be on the horizon.\n\nBelow we'll hand out 2019 grades for Vikings defensive linemen and set up the outlook for 2020.\n\nPreviously\n\nDalvin Cook's breakout sets up payday; will Vikings buy in?\n\nStefon Diggs, Kyle Rudolph adjusted to most change with Vikings\n\nOffensive line improved, but talent gap clear vs. NFC's best\n\nKirk Cousins delivers best season; will that mean $100 million?\n\nEric Kendricks' 2019 makes him one of NFL's best linebackers\n\n2020: DT Jaleel Johnson ($905K), DT Hercules Mata'afa ($661K), DE Ifeadi Odenigbo ($660K), DE Eddie Yarbrough ($660K), DE Stacy Keely ($510K)\n\nGrades are based on a 1-to-5 scale, with '5' marking excellence, '4' for above-average, '3' for average, '2' for below-average and '1' for failure to perform. Players that did not accrue a season (weren't on the active roster for at least six weeks) or played in five games or fewer are not graded. Below are individual grades, based on game and practice observations, weekly film reviews and interviews with coaches for 12 defensive linemen who finished the season on the Vikings' active roster, injured reserve or practice squad. Unofficial NFL stats, such as QB pressures, missed tackles and targeted passes, are compiled by ProFootballFocus.com.\n\nDE Danielle Hunter (4.5) -- Only one NFL edge defender, Green Bay's Za'Darius Smith, pressured quarterbacks more than Hunter this season. Continued astronomical ascension at 25 years old with career-high 88 pressures (14.5 sacks) during the regular season. Named to second Pro Bowl. Finished sixth in All-Pro edge voting with four votes. Set an NFL record with 48 sacks before turning 25 years old, surpassing Robert Quinn's mark (45). You can count on one hand the number of defenders with Hunter's blend of speed and power. Plays like a men among boys impervious to plans of double or triple teaming him. Blasted through Chargers running back Austin Ekeler and right tackle Sam Tevi before a strip-sack on Philip Rivers during the Week 15 win at Los Angeles; Ifeadi Odenigbo returned the fumble for a 56-yard touchdown. Season-high three sacks against a lost backup quarterback David Blough in Week 14 win at Detroit. Led the defensive line with 20 run stops, including five on third and fourth downs. Carried out of gap by right tackle Mitchell Schwartz during Damien Williams' 91-yard touchdown run in Week 9 loss at Kansas City.\n\nPlayed 897 snaps [80.9%]. Appeared for one snap in season finale to continue 48 straight starts, third-longest active streak among NFL defensive ends behind only New Orleans' Cameron Jordan and Buffalo's Jerry Hughes. Penalized once for defensive holding, and has been flagged so few times in five NFL seasons that he can recall them. Missed four tackles. Season-high nine combined tackles and three QB hits in Week 2 loss at Green Bay. Relentless speed rusher unleashing nearly unstoppable outside moves for many of his 14.5 sacks. Counters with power moves, including a devastating long arm. Hit multiple inside moves against Saints right tackle Ryan Ramczyk, an All-Pro taking deep pass pro sets while wary of Hunter's speed during the NFC wild-card playoff win. One inside move led to Hunter's strip sack on Drew Brees, one of a career-high four forced fumbles for Hunter. Similarly dominant stretches in San Francisco, despite loss. Right tackle Mike McGlinchey allowed a sack, a pressure and committed a false start across from Hunter in three plays. Earned a $500,000 incentive for reaching 13 sacks; fell 1\/2 sack short of another $500,000 (15 sacks). Turns 26 in the middle of next season, when no individual accolade could be out of reach for Hunter.\n\nDE Everson Griffen (4.0) -- Returned to form with \"violent\" play, as head coach Mike Zimmer describes, and a spark-plug energy that led the team to adopta traditional part of his pregame speech -- \"If you want it, go get it!\" -- as their playoff slogan. Longest-tenured Vikings player in his 11th season. Abused Saints left guard Andrus Peat as an interior rusher on third downs during the NFC wild-card playoff win in New Orleans, racking up a sack, a hit and a pressure leading to a Drew Brees incompletion on the opening three third downs; the latter two vs. Peat. Did most of his damage against left tackles. Finished the regular season with 66 pressures, ranking 14th among all edge defenders. Earned $2 million in incentives -- $1.5 million for being on the game-day roster every week and $500,000 for reaching eight sacks. Appeared to return burst off the line and power in his game after sitting out five games last year to address his mental health. Led the Vikings in 'almost' with an additional 15 quarterback hits. Named to his fourth Pro Bowl (second as an alternate).\n\nPlayed 863 snaps [77.8%]. Penalized eight times, including five early jumps and one roughing call on Matthew Stafford in the Week 7 win vs. Detroit. Played through a knee injury starting Week 11 vs. Denver that lessened a bit his regular season role. Missed 10 tackles, third most on defense. Walked into his second NFL interception when Eagles kicker Jake Elliott's pass on a fake field goal was tipped by safety Anthony Harris. Expected to be a free agent as he can void the remaining three years of his contract, or otherwise likely be released at a current $13.9 million cap charge. Griffen wants \"to be a Viking for life, but it's a business.\"\n\nNT Linval Joseph (3.5) -- Started strong in 10th NFL season with a goal-line stop of Falcons running back Ito Smith and a fourth-quarter sack on Matt Ryan in the Week 1 win vs. Atlanta. Consistently required double teams from opposing offenses. When he wasn't, the 31-year-old Joseph was still walking centers into the backfield like the Lions' Frank Ragnow on a run stop for a two-yard loss in the Week 14 win. Played 559 snaps [50.4%]. Penalized three times, including unnecessary roughness for illegally hitting Giants long snapper Zak DeOssie during a field goal attempt, leading to a first and goal. Missed one tackle. Underwent knee surgery before Week 10 win in Dallas to address meniscus issue. Beat six-week recovery timeline in three weeks and, with the bye week, missed only two games against the Cowboys and Broncos. Continued to play well, but Joseph is a candidate for a restructured contract or release entering his age 32 season with no guaranteed money left and a nearly $13 million cap hit.\n\nDE Ifeadi Odenigbo (3.5) -- Emerged in his third NFL season as a disruptive pass rusher from multiple positions. Told by coaches during an exit interview at TCO Performance Center this month that he's part of the defensive plans moving forward after playing for a roster spot the past two years. Already earned a job for next season coming off a career-high seven sacks, ranking third on the team, and fourth with 26 pressures. Missed two tackles in 12 snaps during Week 1 win against the Falcons, and missed just one more the rest of the season. Played 372 snaps [33.5%]. Not penalized. Made game-changing plays. Four of Odenigbo's seven sacks came on third down, including a strip sack on Philip Rivers in the Week 15 win in Los Angeles; also scooped up a fumble forced by Danielle Hunter and scored a 56-yard touchdown in the win. Sidestepped Cowboys left guard Connor Williams for a fourth-quarter stop of Ezekiel Elliott in the red zone in the Week 10 win in Dallas. Entering a contract season in 2020, and may have a shot at starting depending on other personnel moves this offseason.\n\nDT Shamar Stephen (3.0) -- Signed a three-year, $12.45 million contract in free agency to return to the Vikings after one season in Seattle. Replaced Sheldon Richardson as the three-technique defensive tackle, but did not replace his full-time role. Run-stopping specialist who played first and second downs, ceding third-down pass rushes to defensive ends. Played through a knee injury for more than three months, seemingly limiting his ability. More than half (6) of his 11 run stops came in Weeks 1-5, before he appeared on an injury report. Never left the injury report or missed a game while playing 588 snaps [53%]. Penalized three times, including roughing Bears quarterback Chase Daniel with helmet-to-helmet contact in the Week 4 loss at Chicago. Ineffective as a pass rusher with six pressures (one sack). Gets his hands up instead, leading to three pass deflections. Forced a Melvin Gordon fumble in the third quarter of the Week 15 win at the Chargers. Led the team with no missed tackles.\n\nDE Stephen Weatherly (3.0) -- Tasked with adjusting to a new role in his contract season, moving inside as an interior pass rusher on third downs. Played 523 snaps [50.3%]. Led the team with four pressures and three run stops during his only start at defensive end during the Week 17 loss to the Bears. Still played a part-time role at end, but most pass rushes came against centers and guards. Third on the team with 30 quarterback pressures, including third-down sacks in Week 16 and Week 17 losses to the Packers and Bears. Fourth on the team with nine quarterback hits. Forced one fumble during a fourth-quarter sack of Matt Moore in the Week 9 loss to the Chiefs. Candid about learning curve as an interior rusher, limiting his impact. Plays with hard nose against the run, crashing inside zone handoffs and outside jet sweeps alike. Quick first step, helping him beat Lions tackle Tyrell Crosby on third-and-1 run stop in Week 14 win at Detroit. Missed six tackles.Pending free agent.\n\nDT Jaleel Johnson (3.0) -- Top reserve at defensive tackle. Improved the more he played, but extended run was limited to two games. Particularly good fit at nose tackle, where Johnson played well in wins against the Cowboys and Broncos when the defense allowed just 3.1 yards per carry without Linval Joseph. Tied for the team lead in those wins with five run stops. Shed blocks with strong hands and quick recognition against the run. But seemed to take time to get going in games. Not a consistent anchor against double teams. Missed three tackles. Played a career-high 410 snaps [37%]. Not penalized. Walked Broncos rookie Dalton Risner into the backfield for one of career-high 3.5 sacks on season. Limited as a pass rusher without much burst. Disruptive run defender showing promise in third NFL season with bigger workloads. Entering contract year in 2020.\n\nNT Armon Watts (2.5) -- Strongsixth-round rookie (190th overall) out of Arkansas. 'Redshirt' season ended during Week 10 win in Dallas, the first game after Linval Joseph's knee surgery. Made an immediate impact with two run stops and a split sack in seven snaps. Earned role upon Joseph's return in Week 13 loss at Seattle, where Watts first deflected a Russell Wilson pass at the line leading to Anthony Harris' interception.Played 121 snaps [10.9%]. Not penalized. Put his size (6-5, 295 pounds) to work with a ridiculous pace in seven run stops against 67 carries. Missed two tackles, including on a 14-yard run by Chris Carson in Seattle. Made leaping run stop on the next snap. Coaches ended the season raving about his potential, and Danielle Hunter said he sees a bit of himself in the 23-year-old Watts.\n\nDT Hercules Mata'afa (1.5) -- Flashed in camp and the preseason, including a sack in the Aug. 9 exhibition opener, and earned an interior pass rushing role in his second NFL season. That job was intermittent, however, as he was credited with just one tackle, blowing up a Jamaal Williams screen in Green Bay for a six-yard loss, in 103 snaps [9.3%]. Recovered a botched Packers snap in that loss. Penalized twice in the season opener vs. Atlanta, including an early jump on third down. Undersized (6-2, 254) for an NFL defensive tackle, meaning he'll need to find consistency as a pass rusher to maintain an NFL role. Appeared in five games before starters rested in season finale.\n\nDT Jalyn Holmes (1.5) -- Healthy scratch for 10 games in his second NFL season. The former fourth-round pick out of Ohio State has the long limbs and strength to be an impact player, and had moments in limited opportunities.Played 73 snaps [6.6%], but only in mop-up duty before Linval Joseph's Week 10 knee surgery. Credited with one assisted tackle in 24 snaps against the Cowboys and Broncos. Missed one tackle. Not penalized.\n\nDE Eddie Yarbrough (N\/A) -- Signed off the Bills practice squad on Dec. 31 while Odenigbo (hamstring) and Weatherly (illness) recovered. Did not appear in a game. Credited with 44 solo tackles, two pass deflections and a sack in 31 games (six starts) for Buffalo.\n\nDE Stacy Keely (N\/A) -- Earned a roster spot during a three-day tryout at rookie minicamp in May. Spent all season on the practice squad. Undrafted out of Alabama-Birmingham. Signed a reserve\/future deal on Jan. 21.","525":"Grading the Vikings: Eric Kendricks' 2019 makes him one of NFL's best linebackers As modern NFL offenses stress defenses with motion and misdirection, Eric Kendricks solved many of those problems by seemingly being everywhere at once.\n\nEric Kendricks wasn't given official credit for the first forced fumble in Los Angeles, where he prevented Chargers running back Austin Ekeler from recovering Philip Rivers' fumble, allowing Ifeadi Odenigbo to scoop and score from 56 yards away.\n\nSometime afterward, cornerback Mike Hughes sought sideline advice on how to break up passes between the hands like Kendricks, who either already or was about to jar loose another ball from Chargers tight end Hunter Henry in the fourth quarter.\n\n\"I've never seen a linebacker cover as good as he does,\" Hughes said outside the visiting locker room at Dignity Health Sports Park. \"I actually asked him [Sunday] a few tips on how to play through the hands and get the ball out, because he does a really good job of doing that.\"\n\nKendricks' first All-Pro campaign set a new bar for the fifth-year linebacker, unquestionably the most dominant at his level of the Vikings defense.\n\nBelow, we deliver 2019 grades for Vikings linebackers and set up the outlook for 2020.\n\nPreviously\n\nDalvin Cook's breakout sets up payday; will Vikings buy in?\n\nStefon Diggs, Kyle Rudolph adjusted to most change with Vikings\n\nOffensive line improved, but talent gap clear vs. NFC's best\n\nKirk Cousins delivers best season; will that mean $100 million?\n\nGrades are based on a 1-to-5 scale, with '5' marking excellence, '4' for above-average, '3' for average, '2' for below-average and '1' for failure to perform. Players that did not accrue a season (weren't on the active roster for at least six weeks) or played in five games or fewer are not graded. Below are individual grades, based on game and practice observations, weekly film reviews and interviews with coaches for six linebackers who finished the season on the Vikings' active roster, injured reserve or practice squad. Unofficial NFL stats, such as QB pressures, missed tackles and targeted passes, are compiled by ProFootballFocus.com.\n\nLB Eric Kendricks (4.5) -- As modern NFL offenses stress defenses with motion and misdirection, Kendrick solved many of those problems by seemingly being everywhere at once. Illustrated best when he cut off Alvin Kamara's jet motion on third-and-1 in the NFC wild-card playoff win in New Orleans, leading to a tackle for a loss by Jaleel Johnson. Put his name among the NFL's best in his first All-Pro season with a career-high in run stops (35), pass deflections (12) and forced fumbles (2). Made first Pro Bowl as an alternate. Eight of Kendricks' 12 deflected passes came on third or fourth downs, including a game-winning, diving deflection of an out-breaking throw to Ezekiel Elliott on fourth down in Dallas. Matches speed with proper angles to cover escaping running backs from Aaron Jones to Austin Ekeler, including tricky wheel routes. Showed impeccable feel to track the ball in the air and time contact for pass breakup, including a deep ball to Ekeler in the Week 15 win at the Chargers. Miles Sanders got him for a 32-yard touchdown in the Vikings' Week 6 win over the Eagles. Predicted success in training camp when calling his situation a \"linebacker's dream,\" referring to playing behind Linval Joseph and Shamar Stephen as block-eating defensive tackles. Nearly half of Kendricks' 35 run stops (sixth among NFL linebackers) came in September, including 15 against the Packers, Raiders and Bears.\n\nMore: Why Eric Kendricks deserved more than Pro Bowl alternate\n\nPlayed 962 snaps [86.7%]. One of eight Vikings to eclipse 1,000 snaps, including 65 on special teams. Not penalized. Had some trouble with Rashaad Penny in Week 13 loss in Seattle; outrun on a 10-yard sweep, among others, during the Seahawks' 218-yard rushing night. Ironically, one of his best games, the Week 15 win in Los Angeles, was the last before he was snubbed from the initial Pro Bowl roster. Recovered two fumbles in the Week 16 loss to Green Bay. Suffered a right quad injury during second recovery; missed second half of that loss. Jimmy Garoppolo tried to throw over him twice in NFC Divisional playoff loss, resulting in an interception and near interception broken up by George Kittle. Led the team in tackles for a fifth straight season, but also tied for team-worst 12 missed tackles, including two on 49ers running backs.\n\nLB Anthony Barr (3.5) -- Reneged verbal agreement to sign with the New York Jets last spring and left money on the table to re-sign with the Vikings on a five-year, $67.5 million extension. Roles expanded in sixth NFL season. Paired with Danielle Hunter as bookends of the Vikings' \"diamond\" package, which is a throwback to Mike Zimmer's 3-4 roots in Dallas deploying Hunter and Barr as stand-up outside linebackers, of sorts. Cohesion on display when Barr slyly dropped from stack (4-3) linebacker onto the edge before sacking Matt Ryan in the season's first defensive snap. Forceful run defender who tackled as well as ever while Vikings surrendered just eight rushing touchdowns -- second fewest in the NFL. Career-high 30 run stops came as Barr had a career-low four missed tackles during the regular season. Fell apart in the playoffs with five missed tackles in two games. Highlights were fewer. Fell from 2018's most effective blitzing linebacker to 32nd, despite Vikings again ranking top 5 in sacks. Splashed in Week 5 win at Giants with diving interception off Daniel Jones, Barr's first in four years, and his first safety while knifing between right guard Kevin Zeitler and center Jon Halapio.\n\nPlayed 944 snaps [85.1%]. One of eight Vikings to eclipse 1,000 snaps, including 64 on special teams. Sidelined during Week 3 win vs. Oakland due to groin injury. Penalized four times. Flagged for roughing Matthew Stafford in the Week 7 win at Detroit. Fined $21,056 by the NFL for that hit. At his best as a downhill wrecking ball. Barr delivered the fined hit as a spy, a key role maintained in critical situations allowing him to stay on the attack -- like when he delivered a second-down hit to Russell Wilson in the red zone. Limited as a coverage linebacker, where he allowed touchdowns to running backs Jamaal Williams and Tarik Cohen in division losses at Green Bay and Chicago. Four pass deflections. Made excellent read to blow up an Alvin Kamara screen attempt with 11 seconds left in regulation of the NFC wild-card playoff win in New Orleans.\n\nLB Eric Wilson (3.0) -- Career-high six starts in third NFL season, beginning with a bang. Blocked punt in first quarter of Week 1 win vs. Falcons. Top reserve appearing in 13 games for injured starters, including the last eight games for Ben Gedeon. Played 383 snaps [34.5%]. Penalized once for jumping early on punt return team, giving Broncos a first down and eventual field goal in Week 11 comeback win. Played every snap in two games against the Raiders and Bears (Week 17). High-energy linebacker flashing growth as a playmaker, including a sack and run stop in a three-play span during the Week 4 loss in Chicago. Coaches compare his learning curve to Kendricks, and Wilson is not yet at the stage where he's consistently anticipating blocks and play designs (and taking appropriate angles) like his All-Pro teammate. Remains without a pass deflection in 719 career defensive snaps. Overly eager, out of position on Chris Carson's 25-yard run in Week 13 loss at Seattle. Reliable, if unspectacular, and typically lives up to high standard of being in the right place. Among Vikings' top 10 tacklers, only Linval Joseph and Danielle Hunter had fewer misses than Wilson (5). Core special teams player, ranking second with 280 special teams snaps [65.7%]. Pending restricted free agent.\n\nLB Ben Gedeon (2.0) -- Two-down linebacker continuing weak-side role in the Vikings' 4-3 front. Run-stopping specialist dealt with brunt of job, suffering two concussions. Second brain injury against Broncos in Week 11 ended season on injured reserve. \"Ben loves to play the game. ... He might have pushed it a little too far,\" head coach Mike Zimmer said Dec. 5, in returning from first concussion after a two-game absence. Played 102 snaps [9.2%] in eight games. Missed Week 2 loss at Green Bay due to groin injury. Not penalized. Credited with 11 tackles (none for a loss), four run stops and no missed tackles. Entering final year of rookie contract.\n\nLB Kentrell Brothers (2.0) -- Won preseason\/camp competition against younger linebackers to maintain roles as a reserve and mainstay on coverage\/return teams. Saw mop-up duty in wins against Raiders, Lions and Chargers. First extended defensive snaps after Barr and Kendricks were sidelined in Week 16 loss vs. Green Bay. Missed one tackle -- on Aaron Jones' 56-yard touchdown run in that loss. Played 111 snaps [10%]. Not penalized. Core special teams player ranking fourth on team in coverage tackles (7). Played 222 special teams snaps [52.1%]. Pending free agent.\n\nLB Cameron Smith (N\/A) -- Drafted in the fifth round (162nd overall) out of USC, Smith was the earliest-selected rookie to miss the 53-man roster after the preseason. Twice promoted from the practice squad. Made NFL debut at end of Week 6 win vs. Eagles. Remained on the active roster for final seven games after Ben Gedeon's second concussion in Week 11. Played 33 snaps [3%], including season-high 23 snaps in season finale vs. Bears. Not penalized. Maintained small role on punt return team in playoffs.","526":"Grading the Vikings: Will the Vikings pay Anthony Harris? Keep Xavier Rhodes?

Led all NFL safeties with six interceptions and no touchdowns allowed in coverage during the regular season. Excellent vision and anticipation, not unlike Harrison Smith, of a safety well-prepared on the opponent's tendencies. Knocked as a 2015 undrafted rookie for not being \"athletic enough,\" but he doesn't need to be a world-class sprinter to make plays like the interception off future Hall of Fame quarterback Drew Brees in the NFC wild-card playoff win in New Orleans. Began tracking Ted Ginn's deep post route during Brees' windup, giving him ample time to make the impressive leaping pick (seventh on the year) and 30-yard return to set up a Vikings touchdown drive. One All-Pro vote. Snubbed from his first Pro Bowl. Played 922 snaps [83.1%]. One of eight Vikings to eclipse 1,000 snaps, including 92 on special teams. Missed Week 11 win vs. Denver due to groin injury. Penalized three times, including unnecessary roughness for helmet-to-helmet contact on Jason Witten in Week 10 win at Dallas. Sure tackler, but not a bully in the secondary. Missed five tackles, including Damien Williams during the 91-yard touchdown run in the Week 9 loss at Kansas City. Bounced off Taysom Hill during 28-yard run in New Orleans.\n\nPrimary deep safety, but also dangerous lurking from the box. Played robber throughout the season, starting in Week 1 win vs. Atlanta with two interceptions. Read Matt Ryan's eyes from near the line, dropped and cut off Julio Jones' crossing route for his first pick. Right place again when Russell Wilson batted his own deflected pass into an interception returned 20 yards for Harris' first NFL touchdown in the Week 13 loss at Seattle. Biggest play against in coverage was Marvin Hall's 47-yard grab off a jump ball in the Week 7 win at Detroit. The Vikings haven't used the franchise tag since 2011, but the projected $11.5 million tag for safeties could make sense if a long-term extension in the $14 million annual range isn't reached by mid-March. That would give both sides more time to hammer out a deal, if needed. Pending free agent.\n\nS Harrison Smith (4.0) -- One of six NFL safeties, including teammate Anthony Harris, with at least three interceptions and no touchdowns allowed in coverage. Seven All-Pro votes, falling one vote shy of a second-team honor. Named to his fifth straight Pro Bowl. Covered as well as ever, not allowing a touchdown for the second regular season in three years. Played 984 snaps [88.7%]. One of eight Vikings to eclipse 1,000 snaps, including 53 on special teams. Hamstring injury forced him to miss final six minutes, including the late goal-line stand, of Week 11 comeback win vs. Broncos. Penalized twice for defensive holding. Career-high three forced fumbles included slapping the ball out of Davante Adams' hand in Week 16 loss vs. Green Bay. Heavy hands also ripped a deep pass away from Tyreek Hill in the Week 9 loss at Kansas City, one of Smith's 11 pass deflections. Baited fellow veteran Philip Rivers into a dumb interception by turning hips to sideline covering a go route, then pivoting to pick off a deep crossing route at midfield. Spent fewer snaps on the line of scrimmage or in the box (369) than any season since 2015, perhaps due to problems covering at cornerback.\n\nIn turn, Smith struggled to maintain same impact against the run: career-high nine missed tackles and career-low 11 stops. Tied for team-worst 12 missed tackles overall. Misread play, out of position during Damien Williams' 91-yard touchdown run in Week 9 loss at Kansas City. Remained secondary's top pass rusher sent on 37 blitzes, but had fewest pressures (6) in a season under Mike Zimmer. Swiss Army Knife in coverage, part of why Vikings allowed an NFL-low one touchdown to opposing tight ends in the regular season. Deployed as a red-zone matchup against Saints tight end Jared Cook during the NFC wild-card playoff win in New Orleans. However, Taysom Hill ran by him for a 20-yard touchdown catch in that win. Deserving of a new contract as current deal ranks ninth among safeties in average salary ($10.25M) with just two years left. Turns 31 on Feb. 2.\n\nCB Mackensie Alexander (4.0) -- Started best NFL season with a dislocated elbow on 19th snap in Week 1 win vs. Falcons. Missed two games against the Packers and Raiders before returning with an elbow brace in Chicago. Returned too soon and missed following game against Giants. Ran the post route for tight end Dallas Goedert during second NFL interception in Week 6 win vs. Philadelphia. Played 541 snaps [48.8%]. Not penalized. Immense growth as tackler, having missed 15 in past two seasons; led the defense with no misses this year. Reacts quickly and makes anticipatory plays in coverage, which coaches say is a testament to his film study. Jumped Michael Gallup's whip route in Week 10 win at Dallas, deflecting the second-down pass. Ranked sixth among NFL slot corners allowing an 85.7 passer rating on throws his way. Surrendered two touchdowns in consecutive weeks against the Cowboys and Broncos, but couldn't have covered much better on Dak Prescott's perfectly-placed, 22-yard touchdown to Randall Cobb. Played well enough to get paid by the Vikings, but a league source indicated to the Star Tribune in December that he's looking to top out his value in free agency. Could be too expensive. Pending free agent.\n\nCB Mike Hughes (3.0) -- Debuted Week 3 vs. Oakland with a brace on his surgically-repaired left knee as the slot corner while Mackensie Alexander nursed a dislocated elbow. Played outside and in the slot in Week 5 win at the Giants, deflecting three Daniel Jones passes while replacing Alexander and then Rhodes. Played 505 snaps [45.5%]. Missed six tackles. Started three games, two at left corner for Waynes (Cowboys, Bears) and one in the slot (Giants). Penalized twice. Given punt return job in Week 7 win at Detroit. Season-long, 23-yard return at end of Week 16 loss vs. Green Bay. Forced fumble on 34-yard Mecole Hardman kickoff return out of halftime of the Week 9 loss at Kansas City. Instinctive, quick cover corner willing to tackle. Ranked fourth on team with nine deflections. Second NFL interception on an underthrown deep ball by Philip Rivers in Week 15 win at L.A. Willing to play physical, but limited by size. Allowed three touchdowns, all as Mike Williams, Amari Cooper and Marvin Jones boxed him out or, in Cooper's case, pushed off. While starting for an injured Trae Waynes in the Week 10 win at Dallas, couldn't keep up with Cooper (11 catches, 147 yards). Expected to recover and play again after suffering a broken vertebrae in his neck during season finale loss to Bears. Placed on injured reserve two days before Jan. 5 playoff win in New Orleans.\n\nCB Trae Waynes (3.0) -- Fifth and final season under rookie contract for Vikings showed Waynes is above average when the play is in front of him, but things got dicey when the ball was overhead. Evident in Week 1 win vs. Falcons, crashing from the edge with a low tackle on Devonta Freeman to force fumble; Calvin Ridley caught a 20-yard touchdown over him two quarters later. Surrendered jump balls to the Broncos' Tim Patrick (38 yards) and Chiefs' Tyreek Hill (41 yards), the latter helping set up a Chiefs game-tying field goal in the Week 9 loss at Kansas City. Tied Xavier Rhodes for team-worst five touchdowns allowed, including a 40-yard score to Hill. Hardnosed on short routes, capable of jarring the ball loose with a hit to Alshon Jeffery like he did in the Week 6 win vs. Philadelphia. Nine pass deflections, including one in seven straight games from Weeks 4-11. Only interception came off Matthew Stafford's desperation deep throw at end of Week 7 win in Detroit. Played 782 snaps [70.5%]. Missed Week 10 win at Dallas due to ankle injury. Penalized five times, including twice on the same third down in Week 1. Tied career-worst nine missed tackles, most among Vikings corners. Whiffed on Marvin Jones during one of the Lions receiver's four touchdowns in Week 7 win. Part of a three-man rotation, with Xavier Rhodes and Mike Hughes, at outside corner in last month. Pending free agent.\n\nS Jayron Kearse (2.5) -- Named special teams captain entering his fourth and final season under contract, but the 'C' was removed from his uniform by November after an Oct. 27 DUI arrest. Fifth on the team with 223 special teams snaps [52.3%]. Busy September included replacing Mackensie Alexander as the slot corner in Week 1 win vs. Atlanta. Continued role in Week 2 loss at Green Bay, where he was pulled briefly after a 21-yard catch by Davante Adams and six-yard run by Aaron Jones his way. First NFL interception on Dak Prescott's Hail Mary in Week 10 win at Dallas. Replaced Andrew Sendejo in Week 11 win vs. Denver, covering tight end Noah Fant on last two incompletions of goal-line stand. Played 275 snaps [24.8%]. Not penalized. Missed games against Chargers and 49ers due to a toe injury. Career-high five pass deflections came as he put a 6-foot-4 frame in the right places, with throws hitting his back in games against the Broncos and Packers. Vocal on social media about desire to move on from the Vikings. Pending free agent.\n\nCB Kris Boyd (2.5) -- Led the team in coverage tackles (10) and special teams playing time with 304 snaps [71.4%]. Not bad for a rookie seventh-round pick out of Texas who struggled through training camp and September, when he drew five flags in his first three games. Fined $28,075 for late hit on Packers punt returner Trevor Davis, negating a hold Boyd drew on same play at end of Week 2 loss. Flagged just once in next 15 games, drawing praise from coaches for his growth on and off the field. Played 97 defensive snaps [8.7%]. Carries himself with an edge, annoying the typically stoic receiver Allen Robinson during a season-high 49 defensive snaps in Week 17 loss vs. Bears. Pointed to the flag after Robinson faced up to Boyd and yelled something worthy of a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. Put an exclamation point on his rookie year with a third-down pass breakup on Robinson and two tackles for losses.\n\nS Andrew Sendejo (2.0) -- The Vikings moved on from Sendejo last spring, when he signed a one-year deal with Philadelphia. The Eagles waived him after nine games, gaining compensatory-pick leverage, and the Vikings scooped him up. Started the following game in Week 11 win vs. Broncos due to Anthony Harris' groin injury. Appeared in eight games. Played 153 snaps [13.8%]. Flagged once for unsportsmanlike conduct in season finale vs. Bears for tossing Tarik Cohen's shoe. Missed fourth-and-1 tackle on quarterback Brandon Allen, setting up the Broncos' three goal-line attempts at end of comeback win. Cut off tight end Noah Fant's deep route to intercept Allen earlier in the game. Second pick came off David Blough's desperation attempt at end of Week 14 win vs. Detroit. Only targeted five times as slot defender in playoff games at New Orleans and San Francisco, allowing four catches for 60 yards. Pending free agent.\n\nCB Xavier Rhodes (2.0) -- Looked lost in moments of seventh NFL season, which does not bode well for Rhodes' future in Minnesota without guaranteed money remaining on his contract. Only two NFL cornerbacks, rookies Lonnie Johnson Jr. and DeAndre Baker, allowed more touchdowns (5) without an interception than Rhodes. Candid about his own struggles in season that bottomed out with confusion and sideline anger following a 60-yard touchdown to David Moore in the Week 13 loss at Seattle. Appeared slow and easily manipulated in coverage on plays like Darius Slayton's 35-yard sluggo for a touchdown in the Week 5 win at New York. After solid debut in Week 1 win vs. Falcons, Rhodes was briefly asked to follow Davante Adams in the Week 2 loss at Green Bay; couldn't keep up on crossing route for 15 yards. Allowed two touchdowns to Marvin Jones in the Week 7 win at Detroit. Not only didn't shadow receivers anymore, but was demoted into a cornerback rotation with Mike Hughes after Week 11 issues with Broncos receiver Courtland Sutton who had deep catches for 43 and 48 yards. Put into the spin cycle by Saints receiver Deonte Harris on a nice route during a 50-yard catch in the NFC wild-card playoff win in New Orleans. Gave up 21-yard crosser to Kendrick Bourne on third down of NFC divisional playoff loss in San Francisco.\n\nPlayed 807 snaps [72.8%]. Deflected eight passes, including two in the playoffs. Stuck with Michael Thomas on a third-down comeback route, deflecting the pass to force a punt. Only forced fumble came on DK Metcalf in fourth quarter of Week 13 loss at Seattle. Led the team with 10 penalties, including eight for illegal contact (DPI\/holding). Seven flags in the first eight games led Rhodes to claim there's a \"target on my back\" from officials. Fined $21,506 for horse-collar tackle in Week 5 win vs. Giants. Five tackles for losses most in Vikings secondary. Nine run stops topped Vikings corners, including two in Seattle; drew an unnecessary roughness flag after the first for tossing Chris Carson while on the sideline. Missed seven tackles. Rhodes had problems in 2015, too, so down years in 2018 and 2019 are making his two-year run (and one All-Pro selection) look like the anomaly. Potential restructure or cut candidate with a $12.9 million cap hit, $8.1 million of which clears upon release.\n\nCB Holton Hill (1.5) -- Missed the first half of his second NFL season while serving two four-game suspensions for separate violations of the league's PED and substance-abuse policies. Debuted on defense in Week 10 at Dallas as part of a dime personnel grouping, deflecting a third-down pass to tight end Jason Witten. Played 150 snaps [13.5%], half in season-finale loss to Bears. Aggressive man-to-man corner prone to crossing the line. Penalized once for unnecessary roughness after tossing a 49ers blocker out of bounds post play, giving San Francisco another 15 yards out of halftime of the playoff loss. Fined $10,527 following ejection from Aug. 18 exhibition vs. Seahawks for flagged helmet-to-helmet hit on quarterback Paxton Lynch. Missed two tackles. A lot to prove entering Year 3.\n\nDB Nate Meadors (N\/A) -- Appeared in three games as an undrafted rookie out of UCLA. Played 13 snaps [1.2%]. Vikings coaches put much on his plate, playing Meadors at safety, corner and slot corner. Made NFL debut in slot during Week 2 loss at Green Bay. Blitzed Aaron Rodgers on first NFL snap; surrendered a 12-yard touchdown to Geronimo Allison on third and final snap vs. the Packers. Promoted Jan. 10 to the active roster after the Vikings reportedly worked out (and chose against signing) retired corner Terence Newman following season-ending injuries to Hughes and Alexander. Smart player expected to compete for reserve\/special teams roles in 2020.\n\nCB Marcus Sherels (N\/A) -- The Vikings decided to move on from Sherels, the franchise's all-time leading punt returner, after nine NFL seasons last spring. Only to twice re-sign Sherels due to his replacements being injured. Re-signed Sept. 24 to replace Chad Beebe as punt returner. Fielded six punt returns for 33 yards in three games before he was replaced by Mike Hughes. Re-signed Jan. 3 after Hughes' season-ending neck injury. Fumbled two returns (one lost) in NFC Divisional playoff loss at San Francisco. Pending free agent. Turns 33 next September.\n\nCB Mark Fields (N\/A) -- Acquired Aug. 31 via trade with the Chiefs for a 2021 seventh-round pick to provide cornerback depth while Mike Hughes (knee) and Holton Hill (suspension) were unavailable at the start of the season. Made NFL debut in mop-up duty in Week 1 vs. Falcons, playing six snaps [0.5%]. Undrafted free agent out of Clemson. Waived Week 2, re-signed to practice squad where he spent rest of season. Signed reserve\/future deal on Jan. 12.","527":"Grant will give Minnesota hunters more room for 'walk-in access' Farm Bill grant will provide more public access to private land through DNR program.\n\nA federal Farm Bill grant of $2.5 million has given new life to Minnesota's Walk-in Access hunting program.\n\nGreg Hoch, wildlife prairie team leader for the state Department of Natural Resources, said the money will boost by one-third the amount of private land open to hunters of all kinds as well as other wildlife observers. Of 27 states to request money from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for similar programs, Minnesota received the fifth-largest sum behind Nebraska, Virginia, Oregon and Washington.\n\n\"This gives hunters more room to roam,\" Hoch said. \"It allows us to expand.\"\n\nStarted in 2011 with 9,100 acres in southwestern Minnesota, the DNR's Walk-in Access program had grown by the end of last year to include 28,000 acres in 47 counties. But the hunting privileges would have expired without an infusion of cash this year to extend the state's agreements with landowners.\n\nHoch said the new, three-year USDA grant not only sustains existing agreements, but provides money to add another 10,000 acres of public access. Since 2011, the program's enrollment of land has been expanding north and east from the state's southwestern agricultural region. Hoch said the DNR will target land in the southwest and closer to the Twin Cities for many of the new sign-ups.\n\n\"If we add one more tier we'll be right up against the metro,\" Hoch said. \"That should give hunters increased access where we have a lot of folks in the state.\"\n\nBesides providing more opportunities to hunters, Minnesota's Walk-in Access program helps keep good wildlife habitat from being converted to cropland. Hoch said the DNR only considers land worthy of conservation, and grasslands have been the primary cover type.\n\n\"In everybody's mind it was seen as a pheasant hunting program,\" Hoch said.\n\nBut the access also is used appropriately for hunting waterfowl, deer, turkey, mourning doves, crows, Virginia snipe, squirrels and rabbits. In last year's application to USDA's Voluntary Public Access and Habitat Incentive Program, the DNR also emphasized that the enrolled acres are open to nature photographers and bird-watchers. Competition between states for the program's total allocation of $50 million ended in November. The largest award was $3 million.\n\n\"We ranked relatively high,\" Hoch said.\n\nMinnesota's grant application noted that the state raises matching dollars from hunters every year. In 2019, 25,280 hunters purchased license validations necessary for them to use the private land. Nonresident hunters pay a $5 surcharge for the privilege. The money is poured into the program. One of the strategies is to enroll high-quality private land that abuts existing wildlife management areas, waterfowl production areas or other public land.\n\nThe new grant money should go further in adding huntable acres than it did previously, Hoch said. That's because portions of previous awards were paid to landowners for making habitat improvements. Under the new grant, money will no longer be spent on tree removal projects, prescribed burns, reseeding and other enhancements. Landowners will only receive payment for granting public access and the DNR will continue to work with local soil and water conservation districts to identify wildlife lands that are suitable for hunting.\n\nHoch said landowners are willing to enroll in this program because hunters have been respectful. Restrictions include no motorized vehicles, target practice, dog training, camping, horseback riding or building fires.\n\nParticipating hunters can identify the areas open to them via interactive online maps or a printed atlas supplied by the DNR. In the field, parcels are marked with bright yellow-green boundary signs. Access is open to hunters without requesting permission from landowners, but any licensed trappers who desire access must still get consent from the landowner.","528":"Guitar star Joe Bonamassa cancels his gigs for tonight and Saturday at the Orpheum Blues guitar star Joe Bonamassa has canceled his concerts for tonight and Saturday at the Orpheum Theatre in Minneapolis.\n\nAt 5:18 p.m. today, officials from the Orpheum emailed announcements of the cancellation of the 8 p.m. concerts because the Minnesota health officials have recommended a ban on events of 250 people or more due to COVID-19.\n\nRefunds are available at the place of purchase.

Goff, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, and approved January 29, 2020 (received for review November 22, 2019)\n\nFor several decades, retroviral core uncoating has been thought to occur in the cytoplasm in coordination with reverse transcription, and while some recent studies have concluded that HIV-1 uncoating occurs at the nuclear envelope during nuclear import, none have concluded that uncoating occurs in the nucleus. Here, we developed methods to study HIV-1 uncoating by direct labeling and quantification of the viral capsid protein associated with infectious viral cores that produced transcriptionally active proviruses. We find that infectious viral cores in the nuclei of infected cells are largely intact and uncoat near their integration sites just before integration. These unexpected findings fundamentally change our understanding of HIV-1 postentry replication events.","531":"Hall of Famer Al Kaline dies at 85 By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy\n\nThe Detroit Free Press reports that Hall of Famer Al Kaline -- one of the greatest and most beloved players of his era, and a Detroit Tiger legend -- has died at the age of 85. A family friend tells the Free Press that Kaline recently suffered a stroke, but no official cause of death has been reported.\n\nKaline was signed by the Tigers when he was 18 years-old. A bonus baby, he never played a day in the minor leagues, making his debut for Detroit on June 25, 1953. He'd scuffle that year and the next but he'd break out big in 1955, winning the AL batting title at age 20. That year he put up a line of .340\/.421\/.546 while hitting 27 homers and 102 RBI.\n\nFrom that year on Kaline was a superstar and has never ceased to be mentioned among baseball's greatest.\n\nWhile 1955 may have been an early peak for Kaline, his reputation did not rest on that magical year alone. From 1956 through 1967, Kaline was one of the most solid and consistent players in all of baseball. His batting line over those 12 seasons was .304\/.381\/.506. He averaged 23 home runs and 87 RBI a season over that time, was an All-Star every season and collected ten gold gloves, One as a center fielder, the rest coming in his usual right field. He would miss some significant playing time due to injuries in 1962, 1964, 1965 and 1967- 1962 thanks to a broken collarbone, '64 and '65 due to complications from a childhood foot ailment and 1967 due to a broken hand -- but when he played he was among the most reliable and productive players in all of baseball.\n\nOne thing that eluded Kaline in his prime, however, was team success. In the first 15 years of Kaline's career, the Tigers finished in sixth place twice, in fifth place five times, in fourth place five times, once in third and twice in second. That would all change in 1968. A year which Kaline, ironically enough, played the smallest role in a Tigers' season to that point in his career due to a broken arm suffered in late May. But though his regular season was cut short and Kaline's usual place in right field was being ably filled by Jim Northrup, Tigers manager Mayo Smith wisely installed Kaline back in his usual right field for the World Series, moved Northrup to center and moved center fielder Mickey Stanley to shortstop. Kaline responded by hitting .379\/.400\/.655 in the Fall Classic, helping the Tigers win the World Series in seven games.\n\nFrom 1969 through the end of his career Kaline continued to be productive -- he hit .277\/.362\/.433 -- but time remains undefeated and Kaline's best days were in the past. The Tigers would make one more playoff appearance with Kaline -- in 1972 -- but they'd lose to the eventual World Champion Oakland Athletics. Kaline's final year was 1974, which he spent as a DH. He collected his 3,000th hit in his eight-to-last game as a big leaguer. Kaline was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1980, his first year of eligibility.\n\nAfter his playing career Kaline spent several years as the color commentator for Tigers games on WDIV-TV in Detroit and then took a job, which he held until his death, as a special advisor to the Tigers front office. He was more than a mere ambassador in that role. I had the privilege of interviewing him in 2015 and he was more than conversant about the finest details of the team, its roster, its clubhouse dynamic and where the club was competitively speaking. As I was in the Tigers clubhouse that day, I saw him speaking with Miguel Cabrera about hitting. One Hall of Famer advising a future Hall of Famer about how to break out of a minor slump in which the latter found himself.\n\nRest in Peace, Mr. Tiger.\n\nFollow @craigcalcaterra\n\nHall of Famer Al Kaline dies at 85 originally appeared on NBCSports.com","532":"Hanging droplets from liquid surfaces This article requires a subscription to view the full text.

Slowly becoming a key member of the Indian Test side, the 26-year-old wants to hone his skills with a prominent county side but now the deal will be inked when the situation comes under control and travel bans are lifted globally. \"I was supposed to play four English county games this season. I would only be able to tell you the name when all the paperwork is complete. Right now, it's on hold due to the unavoidable situation (COVID-19),\" Vihari told PTI during an exclusive interaction.\n\nThe Andhra man is confident that he will be able to travel to the UK during the later part of the county season which is played from April to September.\n\n\"Hope once it's under control, I will be able to play those games. It will be a learning experience for me,\" said the soft spoken Vihari.\n\nThe BCCI, in recent years, has allowed top cricketers who are not playing in the IPL to compete in county cricket during the summer months.\n\nThe likes of Cheteshwar Pujara, Ishant Sharma, Ravichandran Ashwin and Ajinkya Rahane are some of the prominent Test specialists who have plied their trade in division 1 and 2 of English county.\n\nVihari's commitment to the game can be gauged from the fact that he played for his employers Nelson CC in the Tamil Nadu CA league on Tuesday. He scored 202 not out against Alwarpet CC in a drawn game.\n\n\"I work for Nelson and I am committed to play when I am available. It was good match practice. Now I am back in Hyderabad. I will be taking a break for the time being,\" he informed.\n\nTalking about his 55 off 70 balls against New Zealand on a green top at the Hagley Oval in Christchurch, the gutsy right-hander was a touch disappointed.\n\n\"I wouldn't call it my best innings. Yes, I was playing well but that innings didn't get a victory for my team. It was good to score runs in tough conditions but you value it more when the team wins,\" he said.\n\nVihari, who made his debut in England, has a decent Test record of 552 runs in nine games with an average of just under 37. Incidentally, he has eight of his nine Tests abroad.\n\n\"I have the self belief and the team believes that I have the technique to get success in overseas conditions,\" he said.\n\nSo, what has been the key to his four half centuries and a century in countries like England, West Indies, New Zealand?\n\n\"Adaptability. I believe I have been able to adapt well in all conditions and I have confidence that I can perform any role that the team assigns me,\" he said.\n\nIndia will be playing nine Test matches (four away against Australia and five at home against England) between November 2020 and February 2021.\n\n\"I am sure that I will get a chance to play in home conditions as well. My job is to work hard and be prepared for any situation,\" he said.\n\nWith no cricketing activity right now due to COVID-19, Vihari, like all other sportspersons, is at home but will follow the routine given by Team India's strength and conditioning coach Nick Webb.\n\n\"We all have individual training chart during off time. I will try and follow that,\" he said.","534":"Happy Holi 2020: Hardik Pandya Celebrates Holi With Fiancee Natasa Stankovic, Family.

On Saturday, Harbhajan complained about losing his bat while travelling from Mumbai to Coimbatore on an Indigo flight. \"As soon as we landed in Coimbatore, I saw that one bat was missing. I do not know about the whereabouts of my bat, I cannot say that it has been stolen,\" the spinner told ANI. The player said despite opting for extra baggage, the airline asked for extra money which the cricketer refused.\n\n\"But my kit bag was not opened after practice, we had opted for the 35kg extra baggage package. At the airport, the authorities told me that we are having extra baggage and they asked us for extra 1200 rupees, but my team did not pay the amount as we had already opted for extra baggage package,\" Harbhajan said.\n\n\"The bat is missing, I don't know whether it is related to the baggage thing or not, the bat is my primary thing. I play with that in the IPL. I last used it during a practice session in Juhu. I have complained to the authorities as the bat is important. Indigo guys have told me that they would look into the matter, I hope they will do the needful,\" he added.\n\nIndigo Airlines replied to the cricketer, apologising for the inconvenience. \"Sorry to know about this, Mr. Singh. Let us get this checked immediately and connect with you.\"\n\nThe veteran off-spinner will take part in the upcoming edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) for the Chennai Super Kings. He was one of the retained players of the franchise.\n\nMS Dhoni has already reached Chennai and has begun practicing for the IPL.

His destructive knock helped Reliance 1 defeat BPCL by 104 runs and progress to the final of the tournament. Pandya hit 20 sixes and six fours in his innings, as he pushed his case for selection in the national team ahead of India's ODI series against South Africa starting March 12. Hardik even took a wicket from the one over that he bowled to complete an all-round performance.\n\nAided by Hardik's 158, Reliance 1 put 238 on the board after being put in to bat first. Spinner Rahul Chahar took three wickets as Reliance 1 bowled BPCL out for 134. India batsman Shreyas Iyer top-scored for BPCL with a 31-ball 42.\n\nHardik's blitzkrieg comes days after he slammed a 39-ball 105 against CAG in the final group stage match of the tournament.\n\nHardik, who underwent a surgery after suffering a lower-back injury last year, was left out of India's recently concluded tour of New Zealand after failing a fitness test.\n\nWith the India-South Africa series and the Indian Premier League coming up, Pandya has used the DY Patil T20 Cup as a platform to gain match fitness and find form.\n\nIn his first match back, Pandya scored 38 off 25 balls against Bank of Baroda in the group stage of the tournament.\n\nAfter his 105 against CAG in the final group stage game, Pandya hit 46 off 29 deliveries and took two wickets against DY Patil A in the quarter-finals.\n\n\"It's fantastic (platform) for someone like me. I have been away for almost six months. This is my second game after a long time. For me it is a good platform to see where I am currently and test my body.

Would you still buy it if you knew it was at least partially experimental?\n\nKickstarter ushered in the latest financial frontier of venture capital micro-financing, allowing anyone to raise funds for whatever project they advertised, be it a drone, bike lock, cheese grater, charging cable, photo book, film, or an education. And as with any kind of startup, the risk of failure was just as likely as the potential for success. I've funded a cycle helmet (Hedkayse), USB cable (Spooly), paper wallet (Paperwallet), and softbox (Sundisc). They've all delivered, although some took more than two years. Of course, you do need to do your homework, and it can be a risk-free way for established manufacturers to fund new products before launch, as well as for buyers to get in early and cheaply. However, backers of the multi-million dollar Zano drone were almost entirely left out of pocket when it failed ignominiously. I'll say it again: do your homework.\n\nOn the camera front, we've had successfully delivered projects from the likes of Intrepid (large formar film camera), Lomography (Petzval lens), and Peak Design (Capture Camera Clip) among others, while Reflex (modular camera) is still underway. The Frankencamera doesn't yet rank as a failure, although five years on, the deliverables have yet to materialize. Even then, when you finally get your paws on the end result, it might not live up to expectations.\n\nCamera Design Flaws\n\nAll of this is fine and, perhaps for many, obvious, particularly given caveat emptor -- aka \"buyer beware.\" However, what you don't expect is for your new, shiny, brand name camera to ship with what could be described as \"design flaws\" or, less generously, as an experimental, untested product. For simplicity, I'm going to split these into three different kinds.\n\nThe first of these is what we might call a \"configuration limitation,\" where a general-purpose product should work as intended, but in certain unusual situations, may not. This is particularly the case for third party products that are designed to work across camera manufacturers, but that may suffer compatibility issues. For example, the Transcend WiFi SD card didn't work in my Nikon D800. One of the requirements for the SD card is that it is continually powered in the card slot. This is fine on newer cameras, but the D800 doesn't power the card by default, so you need to find a setting that does. It turns out that Live View does, along with changing \"Auto Meter Off Delay\" to never. To be fair to these types of products, they've learned from such compatibility problems and usually produce charts showing full or partial compliance, although they're not always accurate or complete.\n\nThe second kind of problem is what we'd call a \"design flaw.\" A manufacturer comes up with a good idea for a product and produces a version that works most of the time. Or to put it another way, they've only partially tested it, and when it's sold to the wider public, it becomes apparent that there is a significant minority for which it doesn't work as expected. Apple faced this problem with antennagate on the iPhone 4, where cupping the hand over the lower-left corner significantly reduced signal strength. Apple first denied it was a problem, then blamed users, before finally providing a rubber case to those that requested it. Nikon has had a few high-profile problems over the years, including oil spotting on the D600, a faulty shutter mechanism on the D750, and problematic IBIS on the Z6\/Z7. This led to product recalls, a scenario that manufacturers want to avoid because of the costs involved.\n\nTo be fair, cameras are complex devices, and manufacturers undertake testing under \"normal use\" scenarios to ascertain that their products work as intended. However, testing a pre-production model in the lab isn't the same as selling 20,000 units to the end-user. Limited pre-production testing with professionals can be invaluable, but by this stage, it may be too late to fix any problems.\n\nSoftware and Hardware\n\nThis highlights the significant difference between software and hardware defects: the former can usually be fixed with an update that the end-user can install. Camera manufacturers regularly release firmware upgrades to camera bodies (and increasingly lenses) that fix a range of problems, as well as adding new functionality. Fuji is particularly renowned for its \"kaizen\" approach to providing feature-rich after-purchase updates to firmware. Indeed, the last firmware release for the X-E2 made it almost identical to the X-E2S.\n\nOf course, the ease with which firmware can be distributed to end-users has meant manufacturers now focus their time on finalizing the hardware, leaving software development to the very end or after the product has shipped. Many users applauded Nikon for introducing impressive focus tracking to the Z6\/Z7 with a firmware upgrade. Yet, isn't this just a case of delivering an unfinished product to the end-user and then letting them patch it later? Nikon doesn't have a great track record of firmware updates. I bemoaned the fact that the 2008 D700 only allowed a maximum of one-stop exposure bracketing. Imagine my surprise when the 2012 D800 still only allowed that. Sony has tended to be even worse, preferring to release new cameras to firmware updates.\n\nThe different approaches to firmware updates by manufacturers are notable. Given end-user expectations of a steady stream of fixes during the lifecycle of a product, this can be a market differentiator. It also leads on to the third kind of problem: experimental features. These are features of a product that are included in a largely untested state. They may work in principle but have had limited application in the real world. I would put Nikon's SnapBridge in this category, and it's a common theme with firmware. Manufacturers don't need to get it right the first time, so they iterate over versions, leaving the end-user to test and report back. It took Nikon quite a few releases of SnapBridge (in both the camera and app) to make it usable.\n\nPentax was rightly criticized for the aperture control block failure on their K-30 and K-50 cameras (although it extended to quite a few other models) that didn't result in a product recall. If you were out of warranty, you'd also end up out of pocket -- somewhere to the tune of $250. This would also appear to be a combination of experimental design and quality control, a bad combination.\n\nAnother infamous experimental feature was Sony's Star Eater -- no, not a new weapon from the Galactic Empire, but a rather overeager bit of computational photography. I've bemoaned the fact that camera manufacturers have been slow to embrace computational processing platforms (and so are no longer relevant); however, Sony is ijna prime position to exploit this, being an integrator across smartphones, software, sensors, and cameras. The Star Eater is a good example of taking this too far -- one of the banes of smartphone photos is image noise. A combination of multi-shot and noise reduction processing makes this unnoticeable, unless of course you introduce noise reduction processing to your top-end pro cameras, which include the highly regarded a7S II. This was a top choice for astrophotographers who required high sensitivity, which, unfortunately, came at the price of removing stars, hence the nickname. To make matters worse, the noise reduction was applied in the raw file, so there was nothing you could do about it. Adding insult to injury was that this was an irreversible firmware update.\n\nNot all experimental features are failures, though. Fuji's first camera to feature Wi-Fi was the low-end X-M1, which worked perfectly. However, given the demographic of likely users, it was possibly treated as a live experiment on a potentially small number of photographers that would use it, wrapped up in a low-cost product. It worked and was rolled out across their other cameras. Experimental features might end up in the oddest of products, not because they belong there, but just to iron out the defects.\n\nShould manufacturers put experimental features into their products?\n\nLead image courtesy Vadim Sherbakov via Unsplash, used under Creative Commons.","541":"Hazardous electric panels The most notorious electric panel is the Federal Pacific Electric Stab-Lok panel, also known as an FPE panel, Federal Pacific panel, or Stab-Lok. All Stab-Lok panels were made by Federal Pacific Electric, and most panels I've found made by Federal Pacific are the Stab-Lok type. In other words, you can usually use these terms interchangeably.\n\nI recommend the proactive replacement of FPE Stab-Lok panels, whether the panel has previously caused a house to start on fire or not. Here's why:\n\nSo why don't we recommend having an electrician evaluate the panel? There's no point. There is nothing that an electrician can do or say to make an FPE Stab-Lok panel safe. Some electricians are under the impression that FPE panels are safe if they can turn every breaker on and off, if every breaker is tightly attached, and if there is no evidence of overheating or scorching in the panel. These things would be dead giveaways that there is a problem, but to truly know if the breaker would trip when it needs to, each breaker would need to actually be tested. This testing would be more expensive than having the entire panel replaced.\n\nWhat does it cost to replace a panel? Replacing an old, unsafe electrical panel is not a huge investment. In most cases, the total cost for this project is less than $1,500. Not only does this eliminate the hazards associated with this panel, but all newer panels have the option to have Arc-Fault Circuit Interrupters (AFCIs) installed, for added fire safety. AFCI devices are not available for older Stab-Lok panels.\n\nWhat about condo buildings? We have a ton of condo buildings throughout the Twin Cities where every unit was constructed with an FPE Stab-Lok panel. Should you be worried about buying a condo in one of these buildings? I don't think there's any cause for concern. My advice is to have the panel replaced in your own unit, and consider bringing up the issue to the association. I've heard of associations here in the Twin Cities where FPE panels have been replaced in every unit of the building for a significantly reduced rate.\n\nThe bottom line is that hazards associated with FPE panels are a known issue throughout the electrical, insurance, and home inspection communities.

In 2018, healthcare became the largest employer in the U.S. California's projected demand alone is approximately 500,000 new health care workers by 2024. As hospitals become overrun, healthcare workers are in even higher demand than ever before.\n\nMisty Frost, CEO of Carrus, an organization dedicated to building learning experiences that allow individuals to enter and then grow their careers in healthcare. Her vast career experience with the healthcare industry has given her insight as to how hospitals can best address staffing shortages, what they can do to attract and keep top talent during this difficult time, as well as what workers can do to better position themselves to transition themselves into a career in healthcare.\n\nBelow are some insights and tips she recommends considering.\n\nLook into non-clinical staff positions. There is a huge demand for non-clinical staff since they make up the bulk of the healthcare system and don't require full medical degrees. These jobs include medical assistants, pharmacy techs and , licensed practical nurses (LPN).\n\nDon't assume you need a medical degree. Often the jobs only require a specific certification and many hospitals are willing to work with them while they finish their educational requirements.\n\nBeing seasoned in the workforce is a plus. In some fields like entertainment and tech, there's a tendency to lean towards younger professionals. However, the hospital environment deals with the high pressure of actual life and death situations, while also needing to demonstrate a patient service mentality. Candidates that have experience in other industries that support that, whether in the customer service industry or military veterans, that experience is highly desirable when looking at candidates for a job.\n\nTransitioning into and within the industry is more favorable than ever. Though most healthcare jobs require some level of certification, once that requirement is met transitioning into the industry from a different industry is very favorable due to the high demand for staff. Once in, there is a higher level of support to keep you employed due to the shortage so you have greater chances for mobility into new roles and expansion of your career.\n\nMedical coding and billing is another dominant role in demand. Having someone who can balance the knowledge of medical terms and procedures to ensure they code bills correctly is critical the viability of a hospital.\n\nBack office infrastructure positions are set for growth. Though not at the level of demand that frontline positions are at, they are set to increase to support the growth of the healthcare system. Healthcare has not traditionally thought strategically about their infrastructure the way that most companies do. However, as larger organizations continue to merge with smaller facilities, the greater the demand for better infrastructure and support functions.\n\nGrowth will continue even after the surge of the demand COVID-19 pandemic. Frost shares that, \"Healthcare is a very person to person job. Patient care is delivered by humans. Some things can be automated, but that part will only grow in demand.\"\n\nTraining and education of clinicians and staff will be paramount. Medical knowledge has been expanding exponentially. Whereas the doubling time was an estimated 50 years back in 1950, it accelerated to 7 years in 1980, 3.5 years in 2010, and 73 days in 2020. This will create a demand for learning professionals that know how to cater to the specific technical skills and time limitations of the ever growing healthcare staff. No matter how skilled and talented might be there will always be a gap between what you know and what there is to know.\n\nFrost advises that, \"If you've been thinking about getting into healthcare or looking to re-skill there's definitely openings and demand with no lack of growth in sight.\" Now be the time to start the endeavor of getting licensed for the job that will either get your foot in the door or plant both your feet in your next major career move.","543":"Healthy Byron Buxton, Max Kepler are key to Twins success One of the few questions surrounding the Twins with under three weeks to Opening Day in Oakland is the health of their outfield.\n\nByron Buxton and Max Kepler are both working their way back from offseason injuries, and while Kepler has played in three games in spring, Buxton has yet to make an appearance.\n\nBut Twins President Dave St. Peter said that all indications are that Buxton will be ready after hitting a career-high .262 last season with 10 home runs, 46 RBI, 30 doubles and an .827 OPS in just 87 games.\n\n\"He looks great. He's coming off of surgery that he had, remember, and he followed that plan to a 'T' and he looks incredibly strong,\" St. Peter said of the Twins' Gold Glove center fielder. \"I know [manager] Rocco Baldelli is going to ease him into games here in the near future, and we expect him and certainly believe he will be full-go going into the season on March 26 in Oakland.\"\n\nKepler, meanwhile, posted career highs across the board with a .252 average, 36 homers, 90 RBI, 98 runs scored, 132 hits and an .855 OPS.\n\n\"We liked the way he conducted his business,'' St. Peter said of Kepler this spring. ''He had a huge breakout year last year mainly playing center field, and I think he's excited to return to right field, where he's incrementally more comfortable,\" St. Peter said. \"We know what he can do with the bat. Again he will be in the lineup in spring training here in the days to come, but he is healthy and ready to go.\"\n\nShould reach 2.5 million\n\nThe Twins drew 2.3 million fans last season, a figure that trailed only the Yankees, Angels, Red Sox and Astros in the American League, and also marked the Twins' highest ticket sales since 2013.\n\n\"We're excited about where we are with the ticket sales side, we're going to be up on season tickets by probably 10 or 15 percent. ... For the home opener on April 2nd, we're approaching a sellout,\" St. Peter said. \"We're gunning for total attendance hopefully more so in the 2.5 million range, which would be a couple hundred thousand more fans from what we drew a year ago, which was 2.3 million. We're feeling good. Tremendous interest in Twins baseball and certainly our fan base is excited for the season.\"\n\nDonaldson leads off the field\n\nOne of the biggest reasons for that excitement is that the team went out and made multiple moves to try and improve on a squad that won the American League Central last season.\n\nThe biggest addition was third baseman Josh Donaldson, and St. Peter said the impression the former American League MVP has made with the club has been fantastic.\n\nDonaldson has played in five games in spring training, hitting .250 (4-for-16) with two doubles.\n\n\"Josh Donaldson has been everything we could have asked for and more. He is tremendously supportive of young players, he has made a great impression with his work ethic and with the way he goes about his business. He is a dynamic individual,\" St. Peter said. \"He's an intense competitor but also, from our point of view, a great teammate. He came to the Twins because we wanted him in Minnesota, but he ultimately sees this as a path to compete for a world championship.\n\n\"He is going to help us win, and he's going to have high expectations about those around him having the same aspirations about winning every single day. That is a great addition to our culture over time.\"\n\nPitching staff nearly set\n\nLast season the Twins finished fifth in the American League in ERA at 4.18, and the front office of Derek Falvey and Thad Levine made a big effort to improve that group. St. Peter said four of the five starters should be in place.\n\n\"I would be surprised if Jose Berrios and Jake Odorizzi and Homer Bailey, certainly Kenta Maeda, didn't form four-fifths of our starting rotation,\" St. Peter said. \"I know there is competition for that fifth spot, understanding that Michael Pineda is not going to be ready to go until the month of May and Rich Hill won't be able to go until the month of June, at the earliest. There is a number of arms competing for that fifth spot, whether it be Devin Smeltzer or Randy Dobnak or Sean Poppen or Jhoulys Chacin, who is a free agent we invited to camp who has had success with Milwaukee of late.\n\n\"We have great competition in camp, and I think Rocco Baldelli and [pitching coach] Wes Johnson are very much encouraged that not only will we have a tough decision to make for that fifth starter but we'll have the depth that we need over the course of the long season.\"\n\nSt. Peter has been with this club for 29 seasons, and he said the expectations around both the front office and the team have never been higher.\n\n\"I think that this year's team at spring training is probably incrementally more confident than we were a year ago,\" he said. \"Frankly, expectations are higher both internally and externally. That's something that we welcome.\"\n\n* If the Vikings don't give Anthony Harris the franchise tag -- which would cost them close to $13 million for one season -- he could wind up with Jon Gruden with the newly relocated Las Vegas Raiders, who are looking for safeties and have $51 million in cap space.\n\n* ESPN ran its list of the top 100 prospects in baseball and had five Twins: Royce Lewis (15), Jhoan Duran (54), Trevor Larnach (58), Alex Kirilloff (63) and Jordan Balazovic (93).\n\n* Terrin Vavra, the former Gophers shortstop and son of former Twins hitting coach Joe Vavra, is in the Rockies farm system and rated as their No. 7 prospect. He hit .318 last season at Class A with 32 doubles and 79 runs scored.\n\n* Sean Hjelle, the Mahtomedi grad who was drafted in the second round by the San Francisco Giants in 2018, has one save in spring training with no runs allowed over two innings.\n\n* Former Timberwolves assistant Eric Musselman, the son of former Gophers coach Bill Musselman, is in his first season at Arkansas. The Razorbacks are 19-11 overall and 7-10 in the SEC, but most NCAA projections have them making the tournament.\n\n* Derrick Rose was injury prone when he was with the Timberwolves and now he is sidelined in Detroit for at least two weeks.\n\n* The Wolves' trade of Robert Covington has worked out great for the Rockets.

I was absolutely devastated by the defeat, \" Daren recounted.\n\n\"I felt like I could have won after pulling off that comeback in the second game and I wanted to win it so much... for the country, the team and myself too, as I hadn't won even a match (he lost in group stage matches against India and Germany).\n\n\"That could have been a life-changing moment that would have meant everything to me as a national shuttler.\n\n\"But I crumbled in the end and let everyone down.\n\n\"Back in the dressing room, nobody spoke.

Everyone was just too dejected to say anything.\"\n\nDaren said it took him months before he could eventually put the disappointment behind him.\n\n\"I had no appetite for the next few days and it haunted me for months, \" he recalled.\n\nAs an independent shuttler, Daren did make amends four years later by reaching the semi-finals of the 2018 World Championships in Nanjing, China.\n\nAs a losing semi-finalist, he picked up a bronze medal, making him only the third Malaysian medallist in World Championships history after Lee Chong Wei (three silvers - London 2011, Guangzhou 2013 and Jakarta 2015) and Wong Choong Hann (silver - Birmingham 2003).\n\n\"I don't think we can compare the two competitions because the team event obviously carries more weight, \" said Daren, who left the national team in 2016.\n\n\"But I hope at least this is something that I can give back to the nation.\"\n\nDaren had indeed made Malaysia proud in Nanjing.\n\nNo one expected him to go far but he went on to gun down higher-ranked players like Indonesia's Jonatan Christie, India's K. Srikanth and Japan's Kanta Tsuneyama before finding his match in eventual champion Kento Momota.\n\nThe quarter-final win over Japan's Tsuneyama, which he won by battling through an ankle injury, won the hearts of badminton fans around the globe. Daren had to take on Momota a day later, and not in his best condition.\n\n\"Even if I was fit and injury-free, there's no way I could beat Momota. At most, I could have taken a game off him. That world title was meant to be his, \" said Daren.\n\n\"But it was a moment to cherish. I must say I'm really proud of that achievement because I was all alone there. There were no support services, or anything. I had coach (Tey) Seu Bock to help me out, but that was a last-minute arrangement from BAM.\"\n\nDaren, now the world No. 41, had planned has intended to call it a day at the end of the year, but the Covid-19 pandemic has changed his plans.","545":"Hearthstone: Ashes of Outland interview  --  The demon hunter workshop Hearthstone game designer Stephen Chang (left) and FX artist Hadidjah Chamberlin dig into the demon hunter.\n\nWhen Ashes of Outland opens up shop April 7, Hearthstone will be celebrating more than just the arrival of a new expansion and Standard year -- it will bring the first new class to Blizzard Entertainment's digital card game since it launched out of a beta test in 2014.\n\nThe demon hunter is the marquee attraction for Ashes of Outland, which is Hearthstone's 17th new card set. It riffs on The Burning Crusade, which was the first expansion of World of Warcraft's long history. This new class takes a bit from some of the other Hearthstone heroes -- the demons of the Warlock, the 1-damage ping attack of Rogue, and the token-style of Druid, Paladin, or Shaman. Throw in new mechanics like Outcast (which give bonuses to cards depending on if they're on the left-most or right-most side of your hand) and Dormant, along with the previous refresh of Priest and the 2020 Hall of Fame class (I don't miss ya, Mind Control Tech!), and Hearthstone looks so much more different than it did in 2019.\n\nAnd that should be a good thing. Digital card games like Hearthstone depend on engaged players buying card packs, bundles, and other in-game goodies. By making these changes, adding modes like Battlegrounds while releasing frequent updates, and creating new classes, Blizzard is making a good case for players, be they lapsed, old regulars, or new, to keep playing (and spending). This is especially important for Blizzard as Magic: The Gathering -- Arena continues to challenge Hearthstone for card-game supremacy.\n\nDuring February's Hearthstone Summit, Blizzard briefed me on the demon hunter and Ashes of Outland. I played a bunch of matches with the deck, and it took me some time to nail down the class's rhythm. I enjoyed how active it feels, as you are often outright going to your opponent's face or setting up big swings for the next turn. I interviewed Hearthstone FX artist Hadidjah Chamberlin and game designer Stephen Chang about the team's approach to creating the demon hunter and its mechanics.\n\nGamesBeat: It's been six years of Hearthstone. Why add a class now? In Hearthstone's first few years, people talked about having new classes, but that died down, and many players had given up on new classes.\n\nHadidjah Chamberlin: A lot of it does have to do with the fact that Hearthstone's been around for six years now. We've had six years to learn about what players enjoy about the nine classes we had, to really refine what we want each of the identities for those classes to be. As part of that, we've gotten to see where there's still room for another class identity, cool things we could do with that that wedge in nicely with all the rest of the classes. That's led us to build a class that feels unique and exciting. It's bringing something new to Hearthstone, but keeps all of the rest of them feeling special.\n\nGamesBeat: When did work on demon hunter start?\n\nStephen Chang: About a year ago, a bit before a year ago, roughly? Our production for expansions runs about a year, and we had talked about it around that time. We wanted to see if there was excitement amongs the team, if we could do it typically. There's a lot of things to think about when adding a new class. We had all those conversations. Everyone was super excited. We thought it would be something that was exciting that we could bring to Hearthstone.\n\nGamesBeat: When you're designing a new class, what do you look at first?\n\nChang: The first thing we looked at when we were approaching the design of the class was, we wanted to make sure we captured the fantasy of the class, what people think of when they think of demon hunter, how to capture that feeling of being a demon hunter: that fast, aggressive, agile style. From there we started iterating and experimenting with the types of archetypes that-how it would make sense in Hearthstone and the types of archetypes that class would have. From there we started iterating on mechanics for the class. We gave it a new keyword, Outcast, and a part of that was both from the thematic standpoint of, these are the outcasts of society. People aren't exactly sure if they're good or evil. They do their own thing. We wanted a mechanic to capture that. The word fit well with the mechanic of caring about the edges of your cards and how to manipulate the cards in your hand to take the most benefit from it. We also spent a ton of time iterating on the hero card. That dictates a lot of how the heroes will play out. We explored a vast variety of hero powers, constantly iterating on it, and then ultimately we landed on the one mana hero power, which is very unique to the demon hunter class. All the original classes have two mana powers. We wanted to capture that fast play style, the idea of demon hunters always being on the attack. We have a lot of cards that play around attacking for the turn and getting bonuses from that.\n\nChamberlin: One of the coolest things for me about demon hunter, that I was having so much fun with in playtests, is that it gives you tons of these interesting tiny decisions, constantly. [The new mechanic] Outcast is a great example of it, because sometimes when you draw an Outcast card, maybe you want to play it right then, but maybe you want to hold on to it. Clearing the rest of your hand out of the way starts to matter. They also have a kit that's very focused on soul magic, where it's -- some of your cards will get benefits from how many of your own minions have died during that turn. That's another thing where play order starts to matter. How you trade your minions, whether you want to go wide with a small board so that you can chip away at a lot of things and have a lot of minions die in one turn to get a powerful version of that card in your hand, there's a lot of cool choices like that. You get to constantly feel pretty clever for those sorts of things. It's really fun to play.\n\nGamesBeat: And also the order of how you attack matters, too.\n\nChamberlin: Yes.\n\nGamesBeat: At what point did having your hero attack first and and then having cards play off effects from that attack crystallize as part of demon hunter kit?\n\nChang: A lot of it was just that we wanted to live out the fantasy of the demon hunter leading the charge of the armies following it. We wanted to ensure that the class was very active. By attacking and getting a lot of bonuses from that, it encourages a very proactive playstyle. That was one of the things we definitely wanted to capture with demon hunter. They do a lot of front line attacking, but they also jump into the back line to attack. We wanted to capture all of that mechanically in Hearthstone. But we also want -- there's also the soul magic archetype, but there's also a big demon archetype as well. Demon hunters care a lot about having power. There are demons out there that also really respect power. The demon hunters have recruited some of these big demons to help fight alongside them, and one of the play styles as demon hunter, you can play a very control play style with very large demons that you can summon.\n\nGamesBeat: Like the Imprisoned Antaen, which goes dormant for two turns and then does 10 damage.\n\nChang: Yeah, and also the Pit Commander that will recruit another demon. You have all these giant demons that you can activate that have that more control style, if you're not the type of player that enjoys an aggressive style. There's also that play style that demon hunters have, and it still fits into the fantasy of controlling these large, powerful armies.\n\nGamesBeat: Why did you decide to give a hero power that's only 1 mana?\n\nChang: We iterated a ton initially. The hero power was 2 mana, and we tried a lot of different varieties at 2 mana. But we knew we wanted a hero power that granted an attack, because of all the attack triggers that matter for all the cards we were making. We tried plus 1 attack, immune to plus+1 attack, ignore taunt. We tried activating twice. They all didn't quite fit exactly what we wanted for demon hunter, which was to have a very reliable, fast way to activate and attack and provide that for demon hunter. After all the iteration, someone suggested, what if we just make it 1 mana? Can we do that? That's kind of scary, but we gave it a shot.\n\nWe started playtesting with it. We tried out the variety of cards that worked with it, and it just felt right. It felt fast, and it felt like you had ease of access to activate the things you had. You had a lot of interesting choices. There were a lot of decision points where you might have a card that you want to play on curve, or you might play a card that's a little off curve, but you get a hero power. There were all these tiny decisions that you get to make, a lot of interesting choices. Everything felt right when we started exploring that hero power. We adjusted all the cards to account for a 1 mana hero power, so they were at the right level, and then everything just flowed from there. It was a ton of iteration. We worked a lot on the hero power. But once we got to that point and playtested it, it felt right and felt fun.\n\nChamberlin: It's one of the things that's really fascinating to me, seeing all the iterations in the hero power. When the 1 mana version came in, suddenly it felt right. You felt like a demon hunter, because ... you feel fast. You feel like you can weave it in anywhere. It really contributes to this whole flurry of attacks feeling you have. It's aggressive. It's a bit chaotic. That's something that we were trying to support on all sides, on design, art, everywhere. That was one of the things where it went in and, yeah, now you feel like a demon hunter. It was really cool.\n\nChang: Other iterations, something just felt off. We couldn't explain it. I don't think this is right. All right, back to the drawing board and let's try another one. Eventually we tried that one and it just worked. You know it works when everyone's eyes light up. This feels right. This is how this hero should feel like when you're playing it. It really fit that fantasy of being a demon hunter.","546":"Heat Cable Installation This is a guest blog post by Steve Kuhl of Radiant Solutions Company. Part 3 of 3.\n\nWelcome to the final entry in my three-part series on ice dam prevention and heat cables. In part one, Should you install heat cables to prevent ice dams?, I discussed the most common solutions employed to prevent ice dams. In part two, Not all heat cable is created equal, I geeked out on the topic of heat cable types in depth. Today I will describe how to best employ heat cables on your home to prevent damage from ice dams.\n\nIce dams are most often located on the lowest edge of the roof, commonly called the 'eave'. They are also found in other, sneakier places such as above skylights and low slope shed dormers. For the most part, the majority of the heat cable jobs we install involve treating the eaves and gutters. Running cable in the typical \"zig-zag\" pattern along the eaves of areas prone to ice dam formation will eliminate leaks from ice dams by melting paths through the snow and ice, giving water the opportunity to leave the roof.\n\nSpeaking of gutters, I need to clear something up immediately. Gutters have NOTHING to do with the formation or severity of ice dams. Notice in the above illustration that the origin of the leaks caused by the typical ice dam does not change, with or without gutters. Put simply, if your home has bad ice dams and you have gutters, removing those gutters will have zero impact on the severity of those ice dams.\n\nI know, because I have seen this attempted a number of times by desperate homeowners. Moreover, homeowners often make the mistake of thinking that installing heat cable in the gutters alone will help. It will not. Yes, it is smart to put heat tape in gutters to help water move off your roof and away from your foundation. No, installing cable in the gutters alone will not prevent damage to your home if ice dams visit.\n\nThe simplest way to figure out the parts and pieces needed for your heat cable system is to plug in a few pieces of basic information into an online Heat Cable Calculator. Measure the length and depth of your eave. If you have gutters and a valley, plug in that info as well. No special skills or knowledge are required; just answer a few basic questions. The heat tape calculator will immediately tell you the cable length you need in addition to the number of heat cable roof clips required. It's that easy. You can use this information to purchase any self-regulating heat cable system you like.\n\nAs I described in great detail in Part Two of my ice dam prevention series, there are only two classes of heat cable one can use for ice dam prevention: Constant Wattage (Sold under the brand names EasyHeat, Frost King, King and Prime), or Self-Regulating (Sold under the brand names Heat Tape Pro, Raychem and Thermon). We install Heat Tape Pro exclusively, but Raychem Winterguard is another excellent self-regulating heat cable our installers have used in the past. To a large extent, it doesn't matter which cable system you use as long as it is self-regulating and made by a reputable company. The limitations of constant wattage systems far outweigh their only advantage, cheap prices.\n\nThe type of clip you will use for your roof and gutter deicing system will depend on the roof material on your home. The vast majority of heat cable is installed on standard asphalt shingles making the roof clip choice simple. The Grip Clip is the clip we use for all of our installations because it eliminates the need to drive nails or screws through your roof system. It also installs in about three seconds without the use of tools. We still use traditional nail-on clips for the installation of heat cable on rubber and metal roofs. Installers apply a dot of adhesive to the back of each clip before securing it with a nail or screw. We allow the adhesives to fully cure before installing the heat cable, a process that can take a few days or weeks depending on variables such as the roof material and the outdoor temperatures.\n\nHeat cable can be installed at any temperature but it's generally easier at 30 degrees or above. Once you have your cable and clips in hand it's time to roll up your sleeves and get to work. The tools required for the average install are quite basic: a putty knife and a ladder. A tool belt is handy to keep your roof clips readily available. Manufacturers provide installation manuals that describe the process in greater detail, but here is a summary:\n\n1. Visualize Your Heat Cable Layout: The cable should be installed in a zig-zag pattern along all eaves you wish to protect. If you have gutters, it should be run in the gutters to give water an avenue to escape.\n\n2. Power Source: If your power source is near the ground, plan on running the heat cable either up your downspout or up the side wall of your home. In the case of the latter, you can use standard wire staples from any hardware store to affix the cable neatly to the wall. Otherwise, your cable will run up the downspout in order to provide a path for water to use as it travels off your roof.\n\n3. Use sidewalk chalk to lightly mark out your clip locations on the roof before installation. This extra step will help work through challenges like clip spacing before you commit to installing the clips and heat cable. Clip spacing often gets compressed near valleys and this is completely fine.\n\n4. Install Grip Clips approximately 24\" apart on both the bottom and top of your zig-zag pattern. You can install Grip Clips on the side of a shingle as needed to accommodate cable that needs to run vertically up the roof. The height of your pattern--how far up the roof the heat cable will travel--is determined by the depth of your eaves. The rule of thumb is that heat cable should go about 6 inches beyond the location of the exterior wall below. For example, if your eaves are 12\" deep, you will want the heat cable pattern 18\" up the roof.\n\n5. If you have a valley, run the cable a minimum of 6 feet up and back down the valley. Use Grip Clips installed sideways on the shingles in the valley to keep the heat cable locked in place in the valley.\n\n6. Stretch the cable out in the yard to remove any twists. This will make install much smoother. Run the heat cable from clip to clip, pulling the cable just tight enough to maintain a clean, tidy pattern on the roof. Pinch the cable into the 'cradle' of the heat cable clip. Do not pull the cable tight between clips as this will put unnecessary stress on the system.\n\n7. There are few hard and fast rules in terms of installing self-regulating heat cable in gutters. There is no need to affix the cable to the gutter itself because it will do its job even if it is simply laid in the bottom of the gutter. One important note is that you should use a downspout hanger whenever the cable drops down into a downspout. This will provide protection to the cable against damage from the sharp edges and screws.\n\nWe receive many requests each week for the installation of heat cable on metal roofs. Heat cable on standing seam metal roofs, corrugated metal roofs and screw-down metal roofs all require slightly different approaches. The same basic rules apply to installing heat cable on metal roofs as for standard asphalt shingle roofs (i.e., cable pattern, clip locations, etc.). The primary difference is the type of roof clip and how they are installed.\n\nInstallers around the country have used the same method for installing heat cable on metal roofs for years. Specifically, they use traditional nail-on roof clips with a combination of adhesive and screws to provide anchoring points for the heat cable system. It is permissible to use gasketed screws to affix these clips directly to the metal as shown in the PDF above linked to above when the roof system already has screws exposed. All of these methods are a little crude so we are currently in the development of some exciting new solutions to fastening heat cable to metal roofs (Coming early 2020!).\n\nHeat cables have a dubious reputation in the ice dam prevention industry, mainly because people buy the cheapest cables possible and when they inevitably fail the entire concept of heat cables is discredited. Do your research to determine if the other ice dam prevention approaches I discussed in part one are viable for your home. If not, consider a high-quality heat cable. If readers were to take two critical points away from this three-part discussion on heat cables they should be: 1) Heat cable isn't supposed to be a substitute for home improvements that address the underlying cause of ice dams and, 2) If you are going to the spend time and money on heat cables to prevent ice dams you should buy self-regulating cable from a manufacturer you trust.\n\nIf you are interested in learning even more about heat cables, a few weeks ago I sat down with Reuben Saltzman and his crack team to talk shop for his Structure Tech podcast.","547":"Helpful Money-Saving Tips for Surviving the Coronavirus Economic As the world essentially stops moving due to the widespread Coronavirus, many photographers and creatives are left with canceled jobs and nothing on the horizon. While we wait for businesses to open back up, we need to find ways to survive these stressful times. Here are a few helpful tips to get you through this event.\n\nNo More Coffee Shops\n\nFor coffee, switch to the cheap stuff in your home. If you're an energy drink person, the best thing to do is switch to coffee, find an alternate source for your caffeine, or quit altogether. When I was laid off from a full-time position a little over a year ago, I first tried quitting cold turkey to just free up my budget. Even after a few weeks, I just never felt the same alertness during the day, and the cloudiness was starting to affect my work. I then made the switch to caffeine pills, which sounds ridiculous, but is a very cheap alternative and gives you the same energy boost for a fraction of the cost.\n\nNo More Eating Out\n\nEating out, even fast food, should be off the table for you if you're trying to save as much money as possible. The average fast food order costs around $6. If you're doing that even once a day, that's over $40 a week for one meal a day. You'll need to at least double it just for food for the week.\n\nMeal-Prepping Is Your Friend\n\nA good meal-prep can last you a few days or even a week with low-cost food. Most of my meals the last year have been rice or pasta with broccoli, chicken, and spinach, all prepared together with different spices or sauces just to mix it up. Even if you can't really cook, there are websites dedicated to budget-friendly cooking that can help you along the way.\n\nCancel Subscription Services\n\nWe all have at least a couple entertainment subscriptions popping up under our monthly credit card bills. Unfortunately, since we don't know how long this will last, it might be time to cancel those recurring costs until you're able to get back to work. What's lucky with this is for many of these services, you can cancel with no fees attached. And they offer trial memberships that you can use for the time being.\n\nJust a heads up, you can get two months of your Adobe subscription free if you go through their cancellation process.\n\nMonitor Heat and Electricity Usage\n\nLuckily, in the US, we're starting to see it warm up a little, but we still need a little extra heat on at night. Just try and make sure you're not overdoing it. Turn it down a little more than you normally would. The last thing you want is to run out of heat or see a jump in your bill when there's little to no income coming in.\n\nAs for electricity, some of the biggest changes come from lifestyle choices. Unplug anything like an Alexa that is just there, and don't leave lights on. I have trouble falling asleep without something on. When I was having financial trouble, I switched from my computer to an iPad that uses much less electricity. That way, I wasn't wasting electricity for most of the night, and I was able to continue with my routine without destroying my electric bill.\n\nSell Unused Gear and Items Around the House\n\nYou might be interested in putting the KonMari method to use and finding what doesn't spark joy anymore to sell for some savings. You can use ebay, Facebook, or any other third party marketplace site to flip an extra lens, lights, or camera bodies you may have lying around. The profits from selling old laptops, bikes, and miscellaneous items like a photo scanner might also help you out in the long run. The only advice I have for this is if you really are looking for the most profit, selling on your own is the best way to go. Yes, that comes with a little more risk, but as long as you take the right precautions, you'll be safe and covered from any potential frauds.\n\nGet a Side Gig\n\nA lot of people are turning towards delivery apps to get their fix while they work from home. That means delivery drivers are in high demand. There are many different places you can contract for; even Amazon offers a delivery service for their packages. These types of jobs are great for creatives, because they're flexible with little to no required time. This means you can work as long or as little as you need.\n\nThere are also online jobs like translating and transcription for companies like Rev that allow you to work from home and make a little something on the side. Although these jobs are much tougher to acquire, if you get in your hours, they are just as flexible as being a driver.\n\nDave, These Are All Things Everyone Tells Us to Do\n\nYou know why everyone tells you these? Because they work! I'm not here to tell you to go pick up cans on the side of the road to recycle for five cents each. I'm not going to give you advice like invest in Bitcoin just to add random bullet points. I'm going to tell you the truth. Cut back on your lifestyle, try to sell the things you have lying around your house you don't use, and get a side job while we all try and figure this thing out.\n\nIt's probably not what any of us want to read, but we really don't know how long this virus will be a problem or how long it will affect our immediate future. This makes planning ahead incredibly difficult. That's why it's always best to plan for the worst case scenario that this could be longer than a couple weeks. Don't assume business will be back as usual on April 1; it might not work like that. The best thing you can do is to start with the basics of cutting back and take it day by day.\n\nIf you are a photographer currently surviving off savings, let me know what you've been doing to penny-pinch in the comments. And if you're bored out of your mind, read what you can do during this downtime.","548":"Here's who can get a laptop or tablet from CPS for home use Even while Chicago Public Schools officials work to distribute 100,000 devices to students who need them for remote learning, the district estimates 15,000 kids will still be left without a computer and internet access.\n\nCPS has acknowledged from the start that its massive effort to quickly close the technology gap in a district with 271,000 students coming from low-income families won't fully get the job done.\n\n\"We know that the digital divide will not be bridged overnight, and we are committed to finding additional resources for students,\" CPS officials wrote in a recent letter to principals giving guidance for how to distribute the new devices.\n\nFor the laptops, iPads and Chromebooks that are being handed out, including 37,000 newly purchased devices, priority is being given to the kids who have the most significant needs. The district has about 65,000 existing devices, and it's still trying to figure out how to get another 15,000 devices for the remaining kids.\n\nTo start, the district is focusing on communities that pass a certain threshold on the Hardship Index created by the University of Illinois at Chicago's Great Cities Institute. That narrows things down to almost every neighborhood on the South and West Sides.\n\nFrom there, CPS told principals to prioritize students in the following categories: eighth graders and high school juniors and seniors; special education students; English learners; students without a permanent home; and kids in AP or dual credit courses.\n\nThere's no order of priority between those, but students who check more than one box will be given first dibs, CPS said.\n\nAs far as pick-up goes, each school will come up with its own plan. CPS recommends principals use a staggered method so fewer pickups are happening at the same time, and distribution should be set up outside the school.\n\nParents or guardians are urged to contact their school if their child needs a device, and the adults will be required to pick up devices on their kid's behalf. Identity verification will be required, and if a parent doesn't have a valid ID, a utility bill can be used, CPS said.\n\nEach device will come with a charger and instructions on how to use it. Parents and students will be asked to sign a form accepting responsibility for the device, but CPS said families won't be charged if it's damaged or lost.\n\nThe district does, however, want to get back all the devices once this remote learning period is over. So each device will be tracked in a database along with the name and ID number of the student who's using it on loan.","549":"Hey Minnesota, join in on this community singalong from your front steps Annette Topolinski is singing John Lennon's \"Imagine\" every night from her steps - rain or shine - and she wants everyone to join in.","550":"Hey, Twins fans. A moratorium on whining for now, OK? I'm going to keep this short because it's a holiday weekend and we have a lot to do, including relearning the words to Lee Greenwood's \"Proud to be an American\" for when we go watch fireworks and deciding what to wear to watch the women's World Cup final..\n\nThe Twins are five games above .500 and entered Friday's game at Kansas City 3 1.2 games out of first place in the American League Central.\n\nThey would have been a better bet right now to be fourth or fifth and 13 1\/2 games out, or more, when most of us were figuring out stuff at the start of the season.\n\nThe Twins have more starting pitching than they need and have managed to work around and battle through the assortment of flaws that separate them from being taken more seriously. ESPN, which got a bit carried away earlier this season when ranking them fifth, have the Twins at No. 13 in its current power rankings.\n\nDrug-suspended Ervin Santana will pitch against the Royals on Sunday afternoon. His presence is like picking up a veteran at midseason, even if it's happening this way for the wrong reason. The Twins have made the futurists happy by bringing up four of their top minor-leaguers and sending a fifth, the pitcher Jose Berrios, to Rochester, where he is one step away from the majors.\n\nMeanwhile, the Royals have lost four in a row and scored only six runs -- five of them in one game. So maybe the Twins are catching Kansas City at the right time, the same way that Milwaukee (a genuinely bad team) chewed on the Twins last month when they were struggling.\n\nThings are going better than expected. Much better, I'd say, even with June's tumble.\n\nYes, things could still fall apart for all of the reasons we've talked about on the blog.\n\nBut for now, I'd suggest having fun with it. A wary eye on the future doesn't mean we can't have fun right now.","551":"Hey, it's kind of a big series for the Twins Yeah, I'm rolling my eyes a little bit when I look at the American League standings, even if I'm not getting sucked into the \"if the season ended today, the Twins would be in the one-game Wild Card playoff\" thing. Instead, I'm looking at the series that starts tonight in Detroit as kind of a big deal, an indication of how far they appear to have cone since their laughingstock opening series against the Tigers and the 2-of-3 they lost to them at the end of last month before the winning began in earnest.\n\nThe Twins are a cocktail of good stuff and concern right now. But there's enough good stuff to at least have the discussion about whether the team's 18-14 record is somewhat sustainable as the season drags on. It's only a snapshot in time, but ESPN moved the Twins from 21st to 12th in its weekly power rankings, giving the AL Central three of the top dozen teams on the list.\n\nI'm going to worry about the lack of strikeouts by the pitching staff because being last in the majors, by a significant margin, means that fielders are doing more work that you'd like. And given some of the Twins' defensive liabilities, that could well catch up with them over time. Danny Santana is scaring me at shortstop but I've moved on from any thought that he should spend time in center field. Both of the Eduardos (Escobar and Nunez) do the same for me when they play left. The bullpen could stand some improvement and I'm turning a blind eye still to Joe Mauer's OPS+ of 101, which is easier to do because of 18-14.\n\nHere's what I'm going to feel good about:\n\n*The Twins are winning in spite of some numbers not being where they were in 2014. Kurt Suzuki is hitting at a pace that would bring derision if he hadn't established himself with an All-Star 2014 and as the toughest of tough guys when it comes to dealing with the bumps of being a catcher. Brian Dozier is just now starting to hit the way you'd expect and if anyone is having a \"when will Joe Mauer homer\" pool, send me an invite and I'll send you a dollar.\n\n*The starting pitching is getting by for now. Who had Mike Pelfrey as undefeated and with a best-of-the-rotation ERA after a half-dozen times through the rotation? Kyle Gibson looks good more often than not, and his bad outing aren't as bad as last season. They're making up for the other guys right now, with the irony being that Phil Hughes has won a couple of games recently with worse outings than during his April losses.\n\n*Paul Molitor isn't fooling himself. He's managing like he's putting together a jigsaw puzzle, knowing that different pieces are the best fit on different days. I like that Eddie Rosario isn't getting an apprenticeship on the bench and he's made the best of a pitching staff that includes a handful of weak links despite the overall success.\n\n*I'm sorry I made fun of Blaine Boyer earlier in the season. \"The Pretty in Pink refrigerator reference\" was mean-spirited and not worthy for a guy who has since pitched 11 1.\/3 scoreless innings. Name calling is (almost) always wrong, kids. Now I'd like reasons to retire the #FiascoNolasco hashtag and for Brian Duensing to stop making me crazy.\n\n*Trevor Plouffe, for reasons mentioned in detail in an earlier post.\n\n*Pelfrey, because I never thought he was as bad as he was during his two years of struggling. It's fun to watch him pitch well.\n\n*Torii Hunter, whose weekend just ended was better than his previous weekend. Keep speaking with the bat, Torii. It's better for everyone.\n\nThe Twins are coming up on an interesting stretch through the rest of the month. The Tigers and White Sox again, and a bunch of new opponents who are all at or very close to .500. It's more fun right now than we expected, but we'll have a better sense in a few weeks whether the Twins are smoke and mirrors -- or smoke that will lead to a bonfire that we can gather around for the summer and enjoy.","552":"Hierarchically porous Au nanostructures with interconnected channels for efficient mass transport in electrocatalytic CO2 reduction This article requires a subscription to view the full text. If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nA hierarchical structure with multiscale pore networks has been explored to enhance electrocatalytic performance in CO reduction. Here, we thoroughly analyze the effect of each pore network on catalytic performances using nanostructures composed of nanopores and periodic macroporous channels. The tough mass transport within complex nanostructures has attracted much attention as increasing selectivity. However, the productivity improvements of hierarchical nanostructure by efficient mass transport have been rarely investigated in CO reduction. This paper systematically reports the structural effect on both selectivity and productivity by controlling pore sizes and distributions. Therefore, the proposed hierarchically nanostructures show improved mass activity and can further be applied to other electrochemical systems in the same way.","553":"High Court judgment today on Cardinal Pell's conviction appeal Disgraced Cardinal George Pell has either spent his last night in jail or faces many more.\n\nThe most senior Catholic in the world to be convicted of child sexual abuse will learn today whether his final appeal bid to the High Court has been a success.\n\nPell, 78, was convicted in December 2018 of raping a 13-year-old choirboy and molesting his friend after a Sunday Mass at St Patrick's Cathedral in Melbourne in 1996.\n\nHe has maintained his innocence since being confronted with the allegations by Victoria Police in Rome four years ago, but a jury of 12 and Victoria's Court of Appeal ruled otherwise.\n\nPell's lawyers have argued the jury was wrong and the appeal court majority made a mistake.\n\nThe High Court will hand down its decision in Brisbane on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe appeal bid is based on two grounds - firstly that Chief Justice Ann Ferguson and President Chris Maxwell made an error in requiring Pell to prove the offending was \"impossible\" in order to raise reasonable doubt. Secondly, his lawyers have argued the judges erred in concluding the guilty verdicts were not unreasonable, because of findings there was reasonable doubt as to his guilt.\n\nThe full bench of seven judges must first determine whether they will grant Pell special leave to appeal the decision, before the appeal itself can be determined.\n\nPell has spent more than 400 days behind bars since being taken into custody last February.\n\nHis lawyers have urged the High Court to quash his convictions and release him immediately.\n\nProsecutors, led by Victoria's Director of Public Prosecutions Kerri Judd QC, want his conviction to stand.\n\nA third outcome is also possible, raised by the judges themselves. That could involve the initial Victorian appeal decision being reconsidered, either by the High Court or by being sent back to the Court of Appeal. With social distancing rules only two or three people will be allowed in the courtroom, meaning the High Court will break the news online and on social media.\n\nThe judgment is due to be handed down at 10am via a link on Twitter shared by the High Court of Australia.\n\nLike in any appeal court, the decision of the judges could be unanimous or it could be split. The majority decision will stand, which, in this case, would be a 4-3 split.\n\n* MULTIPLE REASONS\n\nIf all the judges reach the same decision for the same reasons, it's possible they'll hand down their decision in a single judgment.\n\nIf there is a split decision, then there'll be a majority judgment handed down. The decisions of the judges in the minority are called dissents.\n\nSometimes judges come to the same decision but for different reasons so they'll each publish their own reasons. That means there could be up to seven different opinions handed down.\n\n* SPECIAL LEAVE APPLICATION REFUSED\n\nThe High Court has to grant Pell special leave to appeal before they can formally consider the appeal.\n\nUsually this happens before the appeal hearing, but in Pell's case it was decided they'd hear the appeal arguments before making a decision on granting special leave.\n\nIf special leave is refused, Pell's conviction will stand and he will remain behind bars.\n\n* SPECIAL LEAVE APPLICATION GRANTED\n\nIf the High Court determines there is a legal question for them to consider, then they'll grant special leave.\n\nAfter considering the two days of arguments and written submissions, the High Court justices could determine that there was no error in the Court of Appeal's majority decision to uphold Pell's conviction.\n\nAlternatively they might find that there was an error but not one that affected the ultimate decision.\n\nIf either are the case, the appeal will be refused and Pell's convictions will be upheld. He will remain in prison.\n\n* APPEAL BOTH REFUSED AND GRANTED\n\nBecause Pell was convicted of charges relating to two separate incidents, it's possible the High Court could grant the appeal in relation to one incident but refuse it in relation to the other.\n\nFor example, they might find there wasn't sufficient evidence for a jury to reach a guilty verdict in relation to the second incident, but there was in relation to the first.\n\nThat could see Pell's conviction quashed on some charges but not others, meaning he would have to be re-sentenced.\n\n* APPEAL GRANTED, CONVICTION QUASHED\n\nIf the High Court determines there was an error in the Court of Appeal majority's decision, they might find that the error was so significant that Pell's convictions should be quashed and he be acquitted.\n\nThis would result in his immediate release from prison. This is what his defence want.\n\n* APPEAL GRANTED, PREVIOUS APPEAL TO BE RE-HEARD\n\nAnother potential outcome is that the High Court determines there was an error in the Court of Appeal's decision, but it was not one that immediately requires Pell's conviction to be overturned.\n\nIt could be ordered that the original appeal be reconsidered, either by the High Court or the Court of Appeal.\n\n* Pell appointed Archbishop of Melbourne by Pope John Paul II\n\n* Pell sexually abuses two 13-year-old choirboys after a Sunday solemn mass at St Patrick's Cathedral, according to a later jury finding.\n\n* A second indecent act is committed by Pell against one of the choirboys in a corridor at the cathedral, the same jury found.\n\n* The Herald-Sun reports Pell is being investigated by Victoria Police's Sano taskforce for \"multiple offences\" committed while he was a priest in Ballarat in the 1970s and Archbishop of Melbourne.\n\n* Pell says the allegations are \"without foundation and utterly false\".\n\n* Under Vatican rules, Pell gives Pope Francis his resignation on his 75th birthday, as is customary.

If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nCardiac and renal dysfunction frequently go hand in hand in hospitalized patients, and epidemiological studies have suggested an inverse correlation between renal function and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This relationship exists regardless of what organ is first affected (1). It reflects upon a complex interplay between heart and kidneys, with dysfunction of one organ often impairing the function of the other. The causal association between chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular risk was initially discussed by Bright in 1836. The notion of passive renal congestion arising from cardiac dysfunction was coined \"rein cardiaque\" by French pathologist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Justin Collet in 1903, while \"cardiorenal syndrome\" (CRS) was introduced in the 1940s to describe the bidirectional interactions between heart and kidneys (2).\n\nKidney injury will stress both the heart and the circulatory system and cardiac dysfunction can, reciprocally, inflict injury on the kidney. Determinants of CRS include hemodynamic parameters such as central venous pressure, extracellular fluid volume, cardiac output, arterial pressure, pulmonary hypertension, and edema. Reduced cardiac performance ultimately limits blood perfusion of all organs including the kidneys and thereby contributes to renal injury. Altered tissue perfusion with disproportionate effects on the kidney leads to overactivation of both the sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin systems (RAS) reported in CRS. Inadequate renal extracellular fluid handling may have deleterious effects on the heart with an ensuing increase in volume preload and afterload and thus myocardial oxygen demand and vasoconstriction -- including of coronary vessels -- and an increase in inflammation, reactive oxygen species, and fibrosis (3).\n\nClinical and epidemiological studies support a causal relationship between CKD, cardiovascular risk, and heart failure (4, 5). In patients with congestive heart failure, a moderate elevation in serum creatinine levels (e.g., by 26.5 \u00b5mol\/L [0.3 mg\/dL]) will significantly increase cardiovascular mortality (6). Thus, even subtle alterations in renal function may ...","556":"Histone H3K27me3 demethylases regulate human Th17 cell development and effector functions by impacting on metabolism Contributed by Marc Feldmann, January 26, 2020 (sent for review November 21, 2019; reviewed by Steffen Gay and John O'Shea)\n\nT cells control many immune functions, with Th17 cells critical in regulating inflammation. Following activation, T cells undergo metabolic reprogramming and utilize glycolysis to increase the ATP availability. Epigenetic mechanisms controlling metabolic functions in T cells are currently not well-defined. Here, we establish an epigenetic link between the histone H3K27me3 demethylases KDM6A\/B and the coordination of a metabolic response. Inhibition of KDM6A\/B leads to global increases in the repressive H3K27me3 histone mark, resulting in down-regulation of key transcription factors, followed by metabolic reprogramming and anergy. This work suggests a critical role of H3K27 demethylase enzymes in maintaining Th17 functions by controlling metabolic switches. Short-term treatment with KDM6 enzyme inhibitors may be useful in the therapy of chronic inflammatory diseases.","557":"Historical comparison of gender inequality in scientific careers across countries and disciplines In summary, despite recent attempts to level the playing field, men continue to outnumber women 2 to 1 in the scientific workforce and, on average, have more productive careers and accumulate more impact. These results confirm, using a unified methodology spanning most of science, previous observations in specific disciplines and countries (2, 9, 11, 12, 16, 35\u21d3\u21d3-38) and support in a quantitative manner the perception that global gender differences in academia is a universal phenomenon persisting in every STEM discipline and in most geographic regions. Moreover, we find that the gender gaps in productivity and impact have increased significantly over the last 60 years. The universality of the phenomenon prompts us to ask: What characteristics of academic careers drive the observed gender-based differences in total productivity and impact?\n\nAs total productivity and impact over a career represent a convolution of annual productivity and publishing career length, to identify the roots of the gender gap, we must separate these two factors. Traditionally, the difficulty of reconstructing full publishing careers has limited the study of annual productivity to a small subset of authors or to career patterns observable during a fixed time frame (39\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3-46). Access to the full publishing career data allows us to decompose each author's total productivity into his or her annual productivity and career length, defined as the time span between a scientist's first and last publication (Fig. 1D and SI Appendix, section S3). We find that the annual productivity differences between men and women are negligible: female authors publish, on average, 1.33 papers per year, while male authors publish, on average, 1.32 papers per year, a difference, that while statistically significant, is considerably smaller than other gender disparities (0.9%, P value ; Fig. 2K). This result is observed in all countries and disciplines (Fig. 2 L and M), and we replicated it in all three datasets (SI Appendix, section S6). The gender difference in annual productivity is small even among the most productive authors (4% for the top 20%) and is reversed for authors of median and low productivity.\n\nThe average annual productivity of scientists has slightly decreased over time; yet, there is consistently no fundamental difference between the genders (Fig. 2O). In other words, when it comes to the number of publications per year, female and male authors are largely indistinguishable, representing the first gender invariant quantity in performance metrics. As we show next, this invariant, our key result, helps us probe the possible roots of the observed gender gaps.\n\nThe comparable annual productivity of male and female scientists suggests that the large gender gap in total career productivity is determined by differences in career length. To test if this is the case, we measured the career length (Fig. 1D) of each scientist in the database, finding that, on average, male authors reach an academic age of 11.0 years before ceasing to publish, while the average terminal academic age of female authors is only 9.3 years (Fig. 2P). This gap persists when authors are grouped by either discipline, country, or affiliation (Fig. 2 Q, R, and S) and has been increasing over the past 60 years (Fig. 2T). Taken together, Fig. 2 K and T suggests that a significant fraction of the variation in total productivity is rooted in variations in career lengths. This conclusion is supported by a strong correlation between the career-length gap and the career-wise productivity gap when we subdivide scientists by discipline (Fig. 3A; Pearson correlation, 0.80) and country (Fig. 3B; Pearson correlation, 0.58). In other words, this strong correlation implies that disciplines or countries with a large gender difference in the career length also have a large gender difference in total productivity, while those disciplines or countries with small gender differences in the career length also have a small gender difference in total productivity. For example, the gender gap in career length is smallest in applied physics (2.6%), as so is the gender gap in total productivity (7.8%). In contrast, in biology and chemistry, men have 19.2% longer careers on average, resulting in a total productivity gender gap that exceeds 35.1%.\n\nGiven the largely indistinguishable annual productivity patterns, we next ask how much of the total productivity and the total impact gender gaps observed above (Fig. 2 A and F) could be explained by the variation in career length. For this, we perform a matching experiment designed to eliminate the gender gaps in career length. In the first population, for each female scientist, we select a male scientist from the same discipline (Fig. 3C and SI Appendix, section S4.B). We then constructed a second matched population, as a subset of the first, in which each female scientist is matched to a male scientist from the same discipline and with exactly the same career length. In these career length-matched samples, the gender gap in total productivity reduces from 31.0 to 7.8% (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, the gender gap in the total impact is also reduced from 38.4 to 12.0% (Fig. 3E). By matching pairs of authors based on observable confounding variables, such as their discipline, we mitigate the influence of these variables on the gender gaps. More strenuous matching criteria controlling for country and affiliation rank do not greatly affect these results, although they limit us to much smaller matched populations (SI Appendix, section S4.B and Fig. S1). While matching cannot rule out that gender differences are influenced by unmatched variables that are unobserved here, the significant decrease in the productivity and impact gender gaps when we control for career length suggests that publication career length is a significant correlate of gender differences in academia.\n\nTo address the factors governing the end of a publishing career, we calculated the dropout rate, defined as the yearly fraction of authors in the population who have just published their last paper (42, 47). We find that, on average, 9.0% of active male scientists stop publishing each year, while the yearly dropout rate for women is nearly 10.8% (Fig. 4A). In other words, each year, women scientists have a 19.5% higher risk to leave academia than male scientists, giving male authors a major cumulative advantage over time. Moreover, this observation demonstrates that the dropout gap is not limited to junior researchers but persists at similar rates throughout scientific careers.\n\nThe average causal effect of this differential attrition is demonstrated through a counterfactual experiment in which we shorten the careers of male authors to simulate dropout rates matching their female counterparts at the same career stage (Fig. 4 C and D and SI Appendix, section S4.F). We find that under similar dropout rates, the differences in total productivity and total impact reduce by roughly two-thirds, namely from 27.4 to 9.0% and from 30.5 to 12.1%, respectively. This result, combined with our previous matching experiment (Fig. 3 D and E), suggests that the difference in dropout rates is a key factor in the observed total productivity and impact differences, accounting for about 67% of the productivity and impact gaps. Yet, the differential dropout rates do not account for the whole effect, suggesting that auxiliary disruptive effects, from perception of talent to resource allocation (15, 21), may also play a potential role.\n\nThe reduction of the gender gaps in both total productivity and total impact by similar amounts suggests that total impact, being the summation over individual articles, may be primarily dependent on productivity (15). To test this hypothesis, we conducted another matching experiment in which we selected a male author from the same discipline and with exactly the same number of total publications as each female author (SI Appendix, section S4.D). In these matched samples, the gender gap in the total impact is completely eliminated, dropping from 38.4% in favor of male authors to 0.8% in favor of female authors (Fig. 4E). This reveals a second gender-invariant quantity -- there is no discernible difference in impact between male and female scientists for the same size body of work. This second gender invariant reinforces our main finding that it is career-length differences that drive the total productivity gap, which consequently drives the impact gender gap in academia. Interestingly, controlling for productivity similarly flips the gender gap in the total number of collaborators throughout a career, from 13.3% in favor of male authors to 16% in favor of female authors (Fig. 4F and SI Appendix, section S4.E).","558":"Hitting coach Brunansky is first hired for Molitor's staff Tom Brunansky, who served as the Twins' hitting coach under Ron Gardenhire for the past two seasons, will hold the same position on Paul Molitor's staff next year, the team announced Thursday.\n\nUnder Brunansky's direction, the Twins ranked fifth in the AL in runs scored and in OPS last season, scoring 101 more runs than they did in 2013, when they ranked 14th.\n\nLike Molitor, who was hired as the Twins' new manager on Monday, Brunansky is a former Minnesota player, though they were never teammates.

A former Los Angeles entertainment lawyer, Mr. Belloni had led the trade outlet's website, weekly print magazine, television arm and events business for nearly four years.\n\nThree people with knowledge of Mr. Belloni's exit said he left because of disagreements with Valence Media, the owner of The Hollywood Reporter and Billboard, the music trade publication.\n\nValence Media's two chief executives, Modi Wiczyk and Asif Satchu, as well as another executive, Deanna Brown, tried to influence The Hollywood Reporter's coverage several times, and Mr. Belloni pushed back, according to the people with knowledge of the split.\n\n\"Today's announcement is the result of a series of conversations I've had for a few months with Modi about the direction at THR,\" Mr. Belloni said in an email to the staff. \"Some may want to read into that, but I'll just say that well-meaning, diligent, ambitious people can disagree about fundamental priorities and strategies.\"\n\nMr. Wiczyk and Mr. Satchu are the founders of Media Rights Capital, a film and TV studio known as MRC whose properties include the 2019 film \"Knives Out\" and the Netflix drama \"Ozark.\" They started overseeing The Hollywood Reporter in 2018 as part of a reorganization of Valence Media, which also owns Dick Clark Productions.\n\nSince Mr. Wiczyk and Mr. Satchu took charge, the people said, Valence Media has put pressure on Mr. Belloni to report favorably on people and projects with ties to MRC. That pressure started to increase last year, the people added, when Valence Media installed Ms. Brown as president of the Billboard-Hollywood Reporter Media Group.\n\nValence Media executives asked Mr. Belloni if they could give him a \"sensitivity list\" filled with names of people and companies in business with Mr. Wiczyk and Mr. Satchu, two people with knowledge of the matter said. If The Hollywood Reporter was planning to cover them, Mr. Belloni was supposed to alert his bosses, the people said. Mr. Belloni, who declined to comment for this article, refused to act on the list and also pushed back against efforts to kill certain articles.\n\nTensions mounted last month during conference calls held by Valence Media to explain its priorities to the editorial staff. The sessions were led by Kelly McBride, a senior vice president at the Poynter Institute, a nonprofit journalism center, whom Valence Media hired as an ethics consultant 18 months ago.\n\nDuring the calls, staff members cited examples of what they considered Valence Media's interference. In one instance, the company had asked Mr. Belloni to kill a profile of Louise Linton, the wife of Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, according to two call participants. Mr. Belloni declined.\n\nAnother source of contention was a published list of the decade's best and worst movies. Ms. Brown told Mr. Belloni the piece was \"off-strategy\" and later killed a planned television segment based on it, the two people said.\n\nAlso deemed \"off-strategy\" was a piece on Jennifer Lopez's re-upping with Guess after the clothing company's co-founder Paul Marciano had resigned after sexual harassment complaints. Ms. Lopez was described as having many \"touch points\" to MRC, the two people said.\n\nHollywood Reporter staff members also expressed concern that a Valence Media executive was looking in Slack channels for details on planned stories. Emily Spence, the executive vice president of communications at Valence Media, said in an interview that she was the one who had gone into newsroom Slack channels before realizing it was \"an infringement.\"\n\n\"I removed myself from the rooms and I have asked I.T. to make these channels only available to editorial employees,\" Ms. Spence said.\n\nMs. McBride, the ethics consultant, compared The Hollywood Reporter to ESPN, where she served as ombudsman from 2011 to 2013. Owned by the Walt Disney Company, ESPN reports on the National Football League and National Basketball Association while also earning revenue from its game broadcasts. Similarly, The Hollywood Reporter covers the studios it depends on as advertisers, and its parent company creates films and shows.\n\n\"The owners are learning to understand editorial independence, and they really embrace it,\" said Ms. McBride, who will continue to advise The Hollywood Reporter while taking a job as the next public editor of National Public Radio. \"They have taken my advice at every turn.\"\n\nMs. Spence, the Valence Media spokeswoman, said, \"We are committed to our publications and to journalistic integrity. We have implemented many of Poynter's recommended changes and recently opened up the discussion beyond our leadership teams to all editorial staff.\"\n\nMr. Belloni joined The Hollywood Reporter in 2006. He replaced Janice Min -- who turned the trade paper into a glossy magazine -- as the publication's newsroom leader in 2016.\n\nTwo people with knowledge of his departure said he knew his run at the publication had come to an end on Friday, hours before he hosted a Trivial Pursuit-themed happy hour for the staff on the videoconferencing app Webex. He asked all the questions.","562":"Home video review: 'Seventh Son' is medieval magic fest with Jeff Bridges, Julianne Moore \"Seventh Son\" (PG-13, Universal) is a medieval magic fest based on the Joseph Delaney book in which a mystical warrior (Jeff Bridges) trains a young apprentice to battle supernatural forces. When he battles the powerful Mother Malkin (Julianne Moore), his young apprentice dies. So he searches for \"the seventh son of the seventh son\" to be his next trainee. Even with 3-D and massive digital effects, the film is a fun throwback to the lower-tech fantasy films of the 1950s, '60s and '70s with effects by the legendary Ray Harryhausen. Contains intense fantasy violence and action throughout, frightening images and brief use of strong language. Extras include two making-of shorts.","563":"Honey bees harbor a diverse gut virome engaging in nested strain-level interactions with the microbiota While bacteriophages are known to play important roles in bacterial communities, phages associated with the specialized gut microbiota of honey bees have not been characterized. We show that a diverse community of phages inhabits the bee gut targeting core bacteria of the microbiota and belonging to new viral genera with a large repertoire of unknown functions. We isolated phages infecting Bifidobacterium asteroides, a core member of the bee gut microbiota. These phages exhibited vastly different host ranges at the strain level providing insights about how diverse phage-bacteria communities coexist in nature. Our work highlights that phages play important roles in the bee gut microbiota by modulating bacterial diversity at the strain level with potential impact on bee health.\n\nThe honey bee gut microbiota influences bee health and has become an important model to study the ecology and evolution of microbiota-host interactions. Yet, little is known about the phage community associated with the bee gut, despite its potential to modulate bacterial diversity or to govern important symbiotic functions. Here we analyzed two metagenomes derived from virus-like particles, analyzed the prevalence of the identified phages across 73 bacterial metagenomes from individual bees, and tested the host range of isolated phages. Our results show that the honey bee gut virome is composed of at least 118 distinct clusters corresponding to both temperate and lytic phages and representing novel genera with a large repertoire of unknown gene functions. We find that the phage community is prevalent in honey bees across space and time and targets the core members of the bee gut microbiota. The large number and high genetic diversity of the viral clusters seems to mirror the high extent of strain-level diversity in the bee gut microbiota. We isolated eight lytic phages that target the core microbiota member Bifidobacterium asteroides, but that exhibited different host ranges at the strain level, resulting in a nested interaction network of coexisting phages and bacterial strains. Collectively, our results show that the honey bee gut virome consists of a complex and diverse phage community that likely plays an important role in regulating strain-level diversity in the bee gut and that holds promise as an experimental model to study bacteria-phage dynamics in natural microbial communities.","564":"Honor Blackman, who starred as iconic Bond girl Pussy Galore in Goldfinger, dies aged 94 ACTRESS Honor Blackman, who played iconic Bond girl Pussy Galore, has died aged 94.\n\nThe star of film, TV and theatre appeared with Sean Connery in the 1964 classic Goldfinger.\n\nAt 38 -- five years older than 007 Sean at the time -- she was one of the oldest to play a Bond girl. But she became one of the film series' all-time favourites.\n\nHonor died peacefully at home in Lewes, East Sussex, from natural causes, surrounded by her family.\n\nShe emerged as high-kicking, often black-clad, action girl Cathy Gale in 1960s TV series The Avengers.\n\nShe appeared opposite Patrick Macnee, with whom she recorded the novelty song Kinky Boots in 1964 -- a reference to the footwear she wore on the show.\n\nIt made the UK singles charts Top Ten when it was re-released in 1990.\n\nHer many roles included that of goddess Hera in the 1963 fantasy film Jason and the Argonauts.\n\nFrom 1990 to 1996 she showed her comedy talents in ITV's The Upper Hand -- playing Laura West, a glamorous gran with a taste for toyboys.\n\nShe previously appeared in the 1970s sitcom Robin's Nest as Marion, the ex-wife of James Nicholls, played by Tony Britton.\n\nHonor starred in a string of musicals too -- including The Sound of Music, My Fair Lady and Cabaret.\n\nMore recently, she toured in Honor Blackman as Herself, which looked back at her life and career.\n\nIn a statement yesterday her family said: \"She was much loved and will be greatly missed by her two children Barnaby and Lottie, and grandchildren Daisy, Oscar, Olive and Toby.\n\n\"As well as being a much-adored mother and grandmother, Honor was an actor of hugely prolific creative talent; with an extraordinary combination of beauty, brains and physical prowess.\n\n\"Along with her unique voice and a dedicated work ethic, she achieved an unparalleled iconic status in the world of film and entertainment.\n\n\"And with absolute commitment to her craft and total professionalism in all her endeavours she contributed to some of the great films and \u00adtheatre productions of our times.\"\n\nHonor, who was born in Plaistow, East London, was gifted acting lessons for her 15th birthday by her parents and began training at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in 1940.\n\nHer progress was halted by the war -- during which she was a motorcycle dispatch rider for the Home Office. She landed her first West End stage role in 1947.\n\nTwice-wed Honor first tied the knot with Bill Sankey in 1948. The marriage lasted eight years.\n\nThen in 1961, she wed British actor Maurice Kaufmann and the pair adopted two children. They split in 1975 and Honor later revealed she preferred staying single.\n\nLast night Bond producers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli led other tributes.\n\nIn a statement, the duo said: \"Today we mark the passing of a film icon, Honor Blackman who shall forever be remembered as Pussy Galore in Goldfinger.\n\n\"She was an extraordinary talent and a beloved member of the Bond family.\n\n\"Our thoughts are with her family at this time.\" Film director Edgar Wright described Honor as the \"ultimate Bond Girl and original Avenger\".\n\nActor Joe McGann, 61, who starred with Blackman in The Upper Hand, said: \"She was fiercely bright, superbly funny and a wonderful actress on screen and on stage.\"","565":"Hornheads jazz group creates unique sound The five-piece a cappella horn section records and plays all over the globe.\n\nThe Hornheads got its start when, in 1991, the horn players accompanying Prince and the New Power Generation began jamming together on the side.\n\n\"We would get together to play and stay sharp,\" said Michael Nelson of Minneapolis, a trombonist, composer and arranger. \"I started expanding it into longer licks. ... I thought it sounded cool and I wanted to make it work on its own.\"\n\nSoon enough, the sound they made just among themselves took on a life of its own, and \"it became our signature,\" Nelson said.\n\nNearly a quarter-century later, the five-piece a cappella jazz-funk horn ensemble is still going strong. And although it still maintains a relationship with Prince, the Hornheads have forged their own path, recording and performing with standout artists from around the globe.\n\nThe players, several of whom live in the west metro, also frequently appear at jazz festivals, concert halls, universities and other venues.\n\nRight now, the Hornheads are recording their fourth album, slated to come out later this year. The two-volume album, titled, \"Everything Blows,\" will feature a mix of original music and cover songs, according to Nelson, who leads the Hornheads.\n\nNelson writes plenty of fresh material for the group. \"One of the first songs I wrote for the Hornheads ended up as a horn feature on a Prince song,\" he said. \"That was an introduction to our pop sound.\"\n\nAt the same time, the Hornheads also play a wide variety of recognizable tunes by Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, Leonard Bernstein and Stevie Wonder, among others. \"Everyone knows that music so they can lock into how to listen to the group,\" Nelson said.\n\nWhat makes the group so distinctive? While brass and wind quintets are common, \"the instruments and the repertoire we have is fairly unique,\" Nelson explained.\n\nBrass quintets tend toward the classical. In contrast, the Hornheads bringstogether contemporary instruments, like the trumpet, trombone and saxophone. \"It's unique to play a cappella that way,\" which, in this context means \"without accompaniment, so in our case it's without a rhythm section,\" Nelson said.\n\nThe funk aspect, which shows the Prince influence, sets the group apart, as well. It involves plenty of improvisation, but \"it still has a real strong structure around it,\" he said.\n\n\"A lot of virtuosity\"\n\nBesides Nelson, the group is made up of Dave Jensen, a trumpet and fluegelhorn player; his wife, Kathy Jensen, on the alto and baritone saxophone; Steve Strand, lead trumpet and fluegelhorn player, and Kenni Holmen, who plays tenor and soprano saxophone, flute and piccolo.\n\nEach of the musicians encounters the others in other settings, as well. Often, they individually play with Broadway shows passing through, pop concerts with the Minnesota Orchestra and commercial projects, and all but Nelson teach.\n\nDespite their busy schedules, the players have always made the Hornheads a priority. Whenever an opportunity comes up, everyone \"makes a real effort to work their schedules around it,\" Nelson said.\n\nHe said the players appreciate the fact that \"We're doing something that nobody else is really doing quite like this... they're making a unique contribution to music.\"\n\nLikewise, the Hornheads have found a niche audience, and the gig has brought them everywhere from the Tokyo Dome in Japan to a jazz festival in Brazil to Bollywood.\n\nOver the years, the Hornheads have recorded with Prince, Chaka Khan, the Jonas Brothers, Jimmy Jam, Mandy Moore, Pedro Abrunhosa, and many more, as its website states.\n\nRecently, the group did a joint venture with Wayne Bergeron, a lead trumpet player with the Gordon Goodwin's Big Phat Band, who is based in Los Angeles, Nelson said. Bergeron does a lot of movie work, he added.\n\nAs a part of that collaboration, Nelson wrote a James Bond medley for Bergeron's big band plus the Hornheads. The Hornheads recorded its part locally, while Bergeron is separately adding the other sounds to the mix. The finished product will come out this summer.\n\nPart of what makes the Hornheads successful is the fact that \"when you play together that long, there's a symbiosis that happens,\" and things come together quickly, Nelson said. \"We don't have to talk about the technicalities, like, 'How long is that note?' or 'How is that phrased?'\u2009\"\n\nFurthermore, when he arranges the music, \"I make a real point to write to everyone's strengths. Everyone gets a chance to have their voice be heard as a soloist and ensemble,\" Nelson said.\n\n\"In tune with each other\"\n\nTrumpet and fluegelhorn player Dave Jensen, of St. Louis Park, said that Nelson is so familiar with their playing that he's able to \"basically find the most beautiful things that we do,\" and write to that, just like what Duke Ellington used to do for his musicians. \"It's such a pleasure, such flawless work,\" he said.\n\nNelson pays attention to the so-called little things, too. For example, whenever the group is recording, his home studio is set up so \"we each have our own spot with a music stand at the height we want, and a mike set up how we want it, everything,\" Jensen said.\n\nProbably because everyone is so seasoned, they're able to \"align the overtone series of our instruments. It's up above the actual sound of our instruments, the tone colors of everyone ... that creates a sound that's amazing,\" Jensen said.\n\nThrough the years, the group has learned to \"naturally play perfectly in tune with each other,\" he said.\n\nIt's fun to work with his wife, Kathy, too, \"to have somebody to share these experiences with,\" he said.\n\nJust before he joined the horn section, he'd been on tour with the Artie Shaw Orchestra, which took him away from home a lot over the course of three years, Jensen said.\n\nMinnetonka resident Kenni Holmen agreed that the group offers much more than a paycheck. \"There is something special with the chemistry of this group,\" he said via e-mail.\n\nWhen they get together, it's like being with family. \"We really enjoy working and laughing together,\" Holmen added.\n\nFor more information about the Hornheads, go to www.hornheads.com.\n\nAnna Pratt is a Minneapolis freelance writer.

That's roughly a $2.5 million to $6.7 million increase after it went up only $2 million last season.\n\nBut eight days later, the NHL put its season on pause due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and it's unclear if or when hockey will even resume at this point. Because of the uncertainty and the risk of the league potentially losing $1 billion in hockey-related revenue, there's legitimate concern about what the ceiling could look like after we get through this, and not just for next season.\n\nCould the NHL's salary cap stay the same? Might it even go down to help ease the escrow pain for players? Anything is possible, but it would require both the NHL and NHLPA to come to an agreement on what that artificial number could look like.\n\nIf the salary cap remains flat, the Blackhawks would be one of the many teams that would find themselves in an extremely tough position. And they better start preparing for that scenario.\n\nAs of right now, the Blackhawks' projected cap hit for next season is $74.1 million, according to Cap Friendly. That number factors in the three players on long-term injured reserve (Calvin de Haan, Brent Seabrook and Andrew Shaw) but also includes the current players on the roster, which comes out to 26 total, so cuts obviously must be made to get down to the maximum of 23.\n\nBut what that number doesn't include is the potential performance bonus overages and the fact the Blackhawks don't have a goaltender signed beyond this season other than Collin Delia, which doesn't leave much room for free agent signings elsewhere. Heck, taking care of their own guys is going to be a major challenge.\n\nThe Blackhawks have nine pending restricted free agents, which most notably includes Drake Caggiula, Dominik Kubalik and Dylan Strome. Corey Crawford is their highest-profile unrestricted free agent. Those are four key pieces the Blackhawks must try to squeeze in under the cap if the priority is to bring all of them back, and - loosely projecting - gives them around $9-10 million to do so.\n\nYou have to wonder if it makes more sense for everyone involved to agree on one-year deals and revisit things the following year after more clarity is provided on the NHL's financial situation, especially with Seattle preparing for league entry and the U.S. television deal set to expire after the 2021-22 season.\n\nFor now, the Blackhawks and the rest of the NHL are waiting to see what the next steps are.

What the Research Does and Doesn't Tell Us Opinion\n\nHow Effective Is Online Learning? What the Research Does and Doesn't Tell Us -- Getty Students who struggle will likely struggle more online By Susanna Loeb March 20, 2020 Printer-Friendly Email Article Reprints Comments\n\nThe times have dictated school closings and the rapid expansion of online education. Can online lessons replace in-school time?\n\nClearly online time cannot provide many of the informal social interactions students have at school, but how will online courses do in terms of moving student learning forward? Research to date gives us some clues and also points us to what we could be doing to support students who are most likely to struggle in the online setting.\n\nThe use of virtual courses among K-12 students has grown rapidly in recent years. Florida, for example, requires all high school students to take at least one online course. Online learning can take a number of different forms. Often people think of Massive Open Online Courses, or MOOCs, where thousands of students watch a video online and fill out questionnaires or take exams based on those lectures.\n\n\"In the online setting, students may have more distractions and less oversight, which can reduce their motivation.\"\n\nMost online courses, however, particularly those serving K-12 students, have a format much more similar to in-person courses. The teacher helps to run virtual discussion among the students, assigns homework, and follows up with individual students. Sometimes these courses are synchronous (teachers and students all meet at the same time) and sometimes they are asynchronous (non-concurrent). In both cases, the teacher is supposed to provide opportunities for students to engage thoughtfully with subject matter, and students, in most cases, are required to interact with each other virtually.\n\nSee Also: Coronavirus and Schools\n\nOnline courses provide opportunities for students. Students in a school that doesn't offer statistics classes may be able to learn statistics with virtual lessons. If students fail algebra, they may be able to catch up during evenings or summer using online classes, and not disrupt their math trajectory at school. So, almost certainly, online classes sometimes benefit students.\n\nIn comparisons of online and in-person classes, however, online classes aren't as effective as in-person classes for most students. Only a little research has assessed the effects of online lessons for elementary and high school students, and even less has used the \"gold standard\" method of comparing the results for students assigned randomly to online or in-person courses. Jessica Heppen and colleagues at the American Institutes for Research and the University of Chicago Consortium on School Research randomly assigned students who had failed second semester Algebra I to either face-to-face or online credit recovery courses over the summer. Students' credit-recovery success rates and algebra test scores were lower in the online setting. Students assigned to the online option also rated their class as more difficult than did their peers assigned to the face-to-face option.\n\nMost of the research on online courses for K-12 students has used large-scale administrative data, looking at otherwise similar students in the two settings. One of these studies, by June Ahn of New York University and Andrew McEachin of the RAND Corp., examined Ohio charter schools; I did another with colleagues looking at Florida public school coursework. Both studies found evidence that online coursetaking was less effective.\n\nAbout this series\n\nThis essay is the fifth in a series that aims to put the pieces of research together so that education decision-makers can evaluate which policies and practices to implement.\n\nThe conveners of this project -- Susanna Loeb, the director of Brown University's Annenberg Institute for School Reform, and Harvard education professor Heather Hill -- have received grant support from the Annenberg Institute for this series.\n\nTo suggest other topics for this series or join in the conversation, use #EdResearchtoPractice on Twitter.\n\nRead the full series here.\n\nIt is not surprising that in-person courses are, on average, more effective. Being in person with teachers and other students creates social pressures and benefits that can help motivate students to engage. Some students do as well in online courses as in in-person courses, some may actually do better, but, on average, students do worse in the online setting, and this is particularly true for students with weaker academic backgrounds.\n\nStudents who struggle in in-person classes are likely to struggle even more online. While the research on virtual schools in K-12 education doesn't address these differences directly, a study of college students that I worked on with Stanford colleagues found very little difference in learning for high-performing students in the online and in-person settings. On the other hand, lower performing students performed meaningfully worse in online courses than in in-person courses.\n\nBut just because students who struggle in in-person classes are even more likely to struggle online doesn't mean that's inevitable. Online teachers will need to consider the needs of less-engaged students and work to engage them. Online courses might be made to work for these students on average, even if they have not in the past.\n\nMore Opinion\n\nFollow Opinion here.\n\nJust like in brick-and-mortar classrooms, online courses need a strong curriculum and strong pedagogical practices. Teachers need to understand what students know and what they don't know, as well as how to help them learn new material. What is different in the online setting is that students may have more distractions and less oversight, which can reduce their motivation. The teacher will need to set norms for engagement -- such as requiring students to regularly ask questions and respond to their peers -- that are different than the norms in the in-person setting.\n\nOnline courses are generally not as effective as in-person classes, but they are certainly better than no classes. A substantial research base developed by Karl Alexander at Johns Hopkins University and many others shows that students, especially students with fewer resources at home, learn less when they are not in school. Right now, virtual courses are allowing students to access lessons and exercises and interact with teachers in ways that would have been impossible if an epidemic had closed schools even a decade or two earlier. So we may be skeptical of online learning, but it is also time to embrace and improve it.\n\nSusanna Loeb is a professor of education and of public affairs at Brown University and the director of the university's Annenberg Institute for School Reform.

Here's how I edited it using Lightroom, deploying a few subtle techniques using adjustment brushes to make the most of the colors and dramatic conditions.\n\nThis article will be in two parts, with the second describing how I used Lightroom's Range Masks to create a few more cunning changes to the resulting image. This opening part runs through how I used adjustment brushes to start to draw out some of the color and also to balance out some of the shadowed areas.\n\nIf you're interested in how I went about shooting this photo, check out this article, which runs you through the location, the weather, lens choice, and camera settings. The photograph was shot on the 24-megapixel Sony a7 III, a very portable and versatile full-frame camera that gives you a lot of flexibility when it comes to post-production.\n\nStraight out of camera. Click any of the images in this article to get a larger version.\n\nThe light that day was flat, giving a very even exposure. I frequently checked my histogram while shooting to make sure that I wasn't losing any detail in the highlights. The mist that was eerily sliding past the cliffs was far more pronounced in person than is conveyed in the SOOC (straight out of camera) image, and I wanted to be certain that I could match the photograph to the reality. This meant ensuring that the peaks of my histogram were not pressed up against the right-hand side of the graph.\n\nFor the brief period that we were shooting, the light didn't change, making life much easier. As a result, I came back with a ton of very similar images, both in terms of contrast and exposure. When shooting, I often did short bursts, while the climber, Zofia Reych, moved between positions, trying to cover myself for capturing the perfect pose. Often, the static positions (of which there are a lot in climbing) are the most boring, while the shots captured mid-movement tend to be more engaging.\n\nThe Wheat From the Chaff\n\nI made an initial pass, trimming around 260 photos down to just under 40. Many of these are behind-the-scenes shots that I'll come back to later. Others are different versions (e.g. landscape), and once we'd finished, Zofia took a load of photos of me doing the climb. The keepers are tagged with three stars. I then did a second pass, giving as few as possible five stars. I've since added some colored labels in there to help me organize BTS, other shots from that trip, and a few random exports.\n\nSometimes, I end up with a load of very similar photographs and choosing one raw file to take forward can be a challenge. I've learned to be strict with myself, forcing myself to make a decision, regardless of my uncertainty. If I don't, it can be difficult to get started. I made my choice, marked it as red, and pushed on.\n\nPlaying With Some Presets\n\nThe five-star pass trimmed the selection down to seven shots, and at that point, I started playing with my presets to see if there was something that inspired me. I used to have very few presets in Lightroom, but over the last two or three years, they seem to have grown, possibly because I've been shooting more often, pursuing more projects, diversifying my portfolio, and also as a result of the shift from Canon to Sony. Many of my presets are named after certain jobs, where I've developed a specific look and feel for a project and then hung onto it for future use. This makes them much easier to remember.\n\nMy first choice is usually \"Copenhagen 2018,\" a preset that I developed for some work for Street Movement, a small architectural and parkour company based in Denmark. It's not very heavy-handed and given the colors in the rock, I wanted to stay quite light so that I didn't distract myself from those orange hues.\n\nThe Copenhagen 2018 preset lifts the blacks using the Tone Curve and also balances the image somewhat by killing the highlights (-36) and lifting the shadows (+20). I tend not to push this too far, as I have a strong aversion to HDR images, and cranking up the shadows while hammering the highlights can be brutal.\n\nThe Blacks slider (-20) then puts a bit of contrast back into the image. At +27, clarity brings a little bite into the texture of the rock. There are no changes to the HSL\/Color panel, nor to the Split Toning.\n\nFighting the Vignette Addiction\n\nI'm told that the first step is to acknowledge the problem, but I love a vignette. Almost certainly too much. This preset places the post-crop vignetting at -20, which for some is already too heavy. My initial edit (see here) was even heavier, partly because I'd not switched on the lens profile in Lightroom for the new Sigma 24-70mm f\/2.8. I've since stepped it back somewhat.\n\nThis felt like a good place from which to build. My first issue was that the climber was not bright enough, but lifting the exposure for the entire scene would ruin the detail in the sky, so I started making some local adjustments.\n\nTo create an Adjustment Brush, you can either click on the tool (see below) or press \"K.\"\n\nI made sure that my brush was feathered and had a flow of around 50 or 60 and started lifting the brightness of the climber and a little of the surrounding rock. Exposure was set to 0.89 and shadows to +13. Parts of the rock looked unnatural where I'd been too heavy-handed, so I used an erase brush to refine my brushing. (Pressing \"O\" brings up a mask of your brushing so that you can see more easily which areas you have covered. Pressing \"P\" hides the pins, which can sometimes get in the way of what you're doing.)\n\nA small tip: sometimes, I find it better to set the flow to 100 and make it more subtle by making a smaller adjustment to the exposure. A reduced flow can be an extra variable that makes the process of brushing harder to control.\n\nGoing in Circles -- Productively\n\nI'll often work in a circular fashion on an image, starting by tweaking one part, moving onto something else completely different, and then coming back to the first part much later. Sometimes, it just takes time to know what you want to do, and you won't know how your changes to one area will then affect something else. Of course, there's a risk that you'll head down the wrong path, but that's when virtual copies and the History panel comes in useful. As you'll see in the second part of this article, my work on the climber was far from done.\n\nPainting With Color\n\nIf you've not used Lightroom's adjustment brushes to play with the colors in an image, you're missing out. I don't use it very often, but under such gray, drab conditions, it's a great way to bring out certain hues.\n\nThe orange of the rock still didn't feel like it was conveying the reality of what I'd experienced on the day, so my next step was to lift them up. I have a brush saved in Lightroom entitled \"Paint orange,\" which literally does just that -- it paints orange. Originally, I created it to give the out-of-focus parts of an image shot during golden hour a bit more of an orange glow, though it has to be used very sparingly.\n\nBasically, create an Adjustment Brush, make sure all of your sliders are set to zero (double-click on \"Effect\"), and then click on the white rectangle with a cross on it. Pick a color, and start painting. Typically, it's easier to start heavy-handed, paint in what you need, and then dial it back by clicking on the color panel again and sliding the saturation down until it appears more natural. I tried to keep the orange to a minimum.\n\nIf there was no climber in the shot, I could have lifted the orange by using the Color\/HSL slider and bumping the saturation and luminance. However, this would also affect the climber's skin, and lacking the layers functionality of Capture One Pro, there's no way of applying the Color\/HSL changes selectively. Lightroom is certainly a simpler piece of software without these layers, but it is more limited as a result.\n\nThis image was starting to take shape, but there was still a lot more work to be done. Check back for part two, where I'll explain how I used adjustment brushes and range masks to bring out the colors in the water and to create more definition between the climber's leggings and the rock.\n\nIf you have any ideas, suggestions, or questions, leave a comment below.","575":"How I Used Lightroom's Range Masks to Bring out the Vibrant Colors in If you've not used Adjustment Brushes with Range Masks to make subtle changes to colors in Lightroom, you're missing out. This is how I used both tools to finish my edit of this rock climbing photograph.\n\nThe first part of this article explained how I chose a preset and then used Adjustment Brushes to brighten the climber and bring out the orange hues within the rock. (If you're interested in how I shot this photograph, click here.) The job is far from finished; here's how I completed the edit, with some split tones and gradient filter thrown in along the way. This is where we'd reached:\n\nThe Water Was Blue, So Why Isn't It Blue?\n\nThe Verzasca Valley is famed for the color of its river. Unfortunately, any camera would struggle to pick up these gorgeous aqua hues on such a gray day, but it's an element that I wanted to bring through. I also knew that a blue\/green tint to the water would balance nicely with the orange of the rock.\n\nThe Color\/HSL panel is no use here. I could pick out the color that's present in the water, but those sliders would impact the entire image, doing weird things to the mountain in the background. Having played, I found that the effect was also quite limited on the water itself.\n\nInstead, I went back to painting with color (click here to see how I painted the rock orange). I picked a strong blue and went a bit crazy. I was careful not to overlap onto any rocks, using the Erase tool for any places that looked sloppy. I left the saturation much higher compared to my orange painting, as even if I'd turned it down, the blue would still be coming through in the white parts of the water, making it look unnatural. Instead, I had a different technique in mind: Range Mask.\n\nClick for bigger.\n\nMaking the Most of the Range Mask\n\nAt the bottom of the Adjustment Brush panel is the option to add a Range Mask. This allows you to target a specific color or luminance (i.e. brightness) with your brush. I chose luminance and dragged the slider on the right across to the left so that the brush only affected a range of shadows, effectively removing the blue from the water's foam. I had not really tried this technique before, but I was pleasantly surprised by the result. I refined it by erasing any areas that still looked odd and painting in more using a brush with a much lower flow where I thought it needed a touch extra.\n\nYou can also use the eyedropper tool to grab the luminance range that you want.\n\nThe \"Show Luminance Mask\" option comes in handy here if you need to check your work. Basically, it presents you with a masked version of your adjustment brush (i.e., it shows your brushwork in red) but with a grayscale version of the image so that you can see where the changes are kicking in.\n\nTidying Away the Distractions\n\nI decided to tidy up the banks of the river using the Clone tool. The tiny, idyllic village of Brione is hidden behind the trees on the left, and the tops of a few street lights were distracting. I also cloned out a few boulders that risked pulling the eye, as they were leaping out at me.\n\nA few other small jobs: the bright red crash pad underneath the climber, Zofia Reych, was annoying me. On the day, I shot a load of plates without the crash pad to give me the option of removing it completely. I had a quick play, but eventually decided to leave it in the shot for a few reasons. Firstly, Zofia didn't want to misrepresent what she was doing: pretending to climb without a mat would have felt odd to her, even if it was my decision. Secondly, with the red of the pad desaturated, it was barely visible.\n\nThis was a simple task: new Adjustment Brush, turn the Saturation to -100, start painting. I could afford to be fairly clumsy with my brushing here, but if you're ever struggling to get this spot on, remember that you can use a Range Mask to target the color that you're trying to kill.\n\nFor some reason, I never feel like Lightroom can completely desaturate something. Fortunately, in this instance, it wasn't a problem to have a very faint hint of the red left in the mat.\n\nBalancing the Brightness\n\nAs mentioned in the first article, I often work in circles, starting on one part of the image, then moving onto another before returning to an area that I thought I'd already finished editing. Sometimes, it's not clear what needs to be done until you've spent some time staring, and it's not unusual for work on one part of an image to make you aware of what needs doing elsewhere.\n\nReturning to Zofia, her face felt a little dark. Another Adjustment Brush fixed this. I have a brush entitled \"Pop face\" saved -- it lifts exposure and shadows a touch but also drops the Clarity (-19) to soften the details in case they are unflattering.\n\nAnother brush lifted some of the tiny shadows in Zofia's face (Shadows +19, Clarity -19) that were a result of her clenching her jaw as she focused on not falling off the rock. I doubt anyone but me would have noticed this, but it made me feel happier. Editing skin is a process that's often much better suited to Photoshop, but in this image, the face is so small and the change so subtle that it didn't need to be too refined.\n\nThis brings up an area where Lightroom annoys me: there's no easy way to toggle a specific adjustment on and off. You can toggle all of the adjustments, but there are many occasions where I want to see the effects of one particular brush. The workaround is to delete an adjustment brush entirely and then Command\/Control+Z to undo the deletion. It's not ideal.\n\nThe Crop\n\nAlong with my addiction to vignettes is a complete inability to hold a camera straight. I rotated the image slightly (press R to bring up the crop\/rotate tool), and knowing that Zofia would need this predominantly for social media, I opted for a 4x5 crop. I like both options for different reasons: I think I prefer the 3x2 ratio for the landscape, but Zofia is smaller in the frame and I fear she gets a bit lost. Let me know what you think.\n\nLifting the Leggings\n\nSpeaking of getting lost: those leggings. They look great in the flesh, but the complex pattern is not ideal for photographs, especially against the complex texture of the rock. One option would be to simply lift the exposure and shadows, but a better option is to create contrast through color (as discussed in this article).\n\nThere's already a lot of green and teal in the design, so I decided to accentuate this, again by painting in some color using an Adjustment Brush.\n\nI went strong and then dialed it back using the same technique as before: a Range Mask based on Luminance that targeted the darker tones. I also played with a few other adjustment settings and settled with lifting the Shadows to +40. Trying to get the balance right -- separating the legs from the rock to make the athlete's form clearer but without making it distracting -- can be quite tricky, and I'm still not sure if it needs changing. Often, I need to spend some time away from the image and come back to it later on before I can get it right.\n\nThis is where I wish Lightroom had greater layers functionality. With Capture One Pro's layers, every means of editing is at your disposal, including tone curves and HSL sliders. By contrast, in Lightroom, Adjustment Brushes can only call on 16 sliders (why is there no Vibrance slider?), the color thing described above (what is that called?!), and the Range Masks. It feels slightly limited by comparison.\n\nMaking a Moodier Sky\n\nThe sky was feeling disappointing compared to what I felt on the day, so I dragged a Gradient Filter down from the top and dialed down the Exposure (-0.55) and Highlights (-42). I wanted an even spread across the clouds, but without reducing the exposure on the rock and Zofia. I had a few options here: I could drag the filter into place (press M, start dragging), click on \"Brush,\" choose \"Erase,\" and then start painting out all of the areas that I didn't want affected. Instead, I decided to use another Range Mask and restrict the graduated filter to highlights. It probably wasn't entirely necessary in this instance, but it's a good habit to get into.\n\nFinal Tweaks\n\nZofia now felt too colorful, so I decided to knock the saturation back slightly (I would have chosen the Vibrancy slider, but it doesn't exist!). This is another area where Lightroom is a bit fiddly: trying to find the right Adjustment Brush from a stack of existing Adjustment Brushes is annoying. With Capture One, it's possible to label layers and stay organized; by contrast, with Lightroom, you just have to click on each pin one by one and stare at the adjustments and\/or mask (toggle the mask by pressing \"O\") until you remember what each one does. If you've made a lot of small changes to, say, a model's face, this can get very complicated very quickly.\n\nFinding the pin that lifted exposure and shadows from quite early on in my editing (see part one), I added to it by dropping the Saturation to -7. The left-hand edge of her leggings looked dark, so I made a new brush and lifted the Exposure by +0.25.\n\nThe final touch was a split tone. I'd left the color temperature of the entire image as it was shot, not wanting to make it colder for fear of killing the orange tones in the rock. As a result, the coldness of the day wasn't coming through, so I added a hint of blue to the shadows, complemented by a tiny touch of orange in the highlights.\n\nIs It Finished?\n\nGood question. I might come back to it and make further changes. Every time I return to the photo after a break and look at the clouds, I tweak them slightly darker and then change my mind again. Very often, I find that my initial attempt at an edit is too heavy, so I might come back in a few weeks and tone it down somewhat. I'm also now leaning towards the 3x2 crop.

Most face masks offer some level of protection and may even help curb the spread of COVID-19, even if they are not the approved N-95 mask. A lot of folks are heeding the Surgeon General's warning and leaving the N-95 masks for frontline health workers, which is why many of us are making our own masks.\n\nAt Family Handyman, we're a lot more familiar with hammers and nails, but something just feels right about trading them in for needles and thread at this point in time.

OK, capturing pin-sharp vistas may be out of the window but you can have a go at drag landscapes. Now, when we say drag we don't mean they're boring! In fact, they are quite the opposite. A drag landscape is about finding a scene with strong lines, pressing the shutter button and as the exposure processes, drag your camera up, down left or right. By doing so, your final landscape will have an abstract or even painting feel to it and you'll be glad to hear that the grey, boring sky is well disguised! The technique also works in harsh contrasty light normally regarded as being no good for photography.\n\nDrag landscapes are something that can work all year round on a variety of subjects but as we mentioned this technique back in March when talking about photographing Daffodils, we thought they'd make the perfect subject.\n\nYou need to move the camera in one clean, steady movement. Using your arms is a good way to control the movement with freedom or you can use a tripod if you prefer a more structured movement. Make sure you've packed your telephoto zoom lens and if you're venturing quite away from home, don't forget the essentials such as spare batteries and memory cards.\n\nYou can think of drag landscapes a bit like a zoom burst except instead of twisting the lens you're moving the entire camera. You need to find your subject, focus up, then move so your lens is pointing away from it. When you're ready, pan back in and when your subject comes into view hit the shutter button.\n\nDon't stop panning until you're past your subject as your shot won't have the blurry, streaks of lines we want to create if you do. You may have to turn Image Stabilisation off as it will want to create a sharp image and this isn't what we are trying to do. If you look at the screen and see you have diagonal lines it's because you moved to the side slightly as you moved your arms down which you may like the look of but if you don't, the beauty of digital means you can delete it and just try again. Getting the right exposure can be tricky, we found a 10th or 6th of a sec was just about right but if you do need to slow it down, even more, try fitting a polarising filter.\n\nOnce you have the hang of it try panning in different directions, paying attention to the shapes and lines of the object you're photographing. If your subject's a waterfall, for example, pan up or down following the flow of water. Lines of trees and bright colours such as fields of Poppies and Rapeseed also work well.\n\nIf you want the image to be slightly more recognisable start the exposure and pause before you begin dragging. If your subject doesn't have any hard edges you can create an abstract shot that's more about texture. Dragging your lens in a circular motion rather than in a straight line will further enhance the abstract feeling but it's not something that will work with all subjects.","578":"How To Watch Parasite In Australia (Update: It's Coming To Stan) Earlier this year Parasite made Oscars history by becoming the first 'foreign language' film to ever win Best Picture.

Some estimates peg the amount of money pursuing this type of strategy at as high as half a trillion dollars. Trades designed to profit from changes in volatility, which are inextricably linked to risk-parity, add as much as a further $2 trillion.\n\nThe issue is not the strategy itself, it is when investors decide that it is no longer useful and decide to exit their positions. In other words, when all at once they dump their positions the market will likely tank.\n\nIn its simplest form risk-parity involves holding two different assets, stock and bonds for example, and periodically changing the portion of each asset owned to keep the overall risk constant.\n\nOn Wall Street, risk equals volatility. When the volatility of stocks jumped last week, in this example, risk-parity traders would have exchanged some of their stock holdings for bonds. Likewise, if bond market volatility increased these traders would switch assets back, bonds to stocks.\n\nMany small investors follow the risk-parity strategy without even knowing it. For instance, their investment portfolio may hold 60% stocks and 40% bonds, which they periodically rebalance to get back to those percentages. Academy Securities' Peter Tchir calls it \"risk-parity lite.\"\n\nProblem No.1\n\nOne problem with the strategy comes when lots of people do the same thing together on a daily basis.\n\nAt that point, the to-and-fro of money flows sends the market up and down like a child's playground seesaw. That's part of what happened in the market recently: Risk-parity traders moved money back and forth between assets. As a result, there was likely more volatility.\n\nLast August I wrote about risk-parity for The Wall Street Journal. The story quoted Jack Ablin, now chief investment strategist with Cresset Wealth Advisors who warned that the trade could cause stock market volatility if such a strategy grew large. At the time, he didn't see it as a problem.\n\nNow the size of the risk parity trade is huge.\n\nHow large? Estimates are all over the place. Some figures I've read in the press go as high as half a trillion dollars. Trades that bet on changes in market volatility could be as high as $2 trillion. Volatility trades and risk-parity trades are closely linked because both types of strategy take their cues from changes in market volatility.\n\nThe key takeaway is lots of money is pursuing these strategies.\n\nBut the extra swings in market prices caused by risk-parity trades is just one issue.\n\nThe risk-parity trade relies on the fact that price movements in stocks and bonds have not been highly correlated, at least historically they haven't been. As long as that lack of correlation remains, then the strategy reduces overall risk for the investor.","580":"How Venezuelan food is slowly finding its way to the UK You may already be familiar with the Colombian arepa, but Venezuela's is bigger and better - and political unrest is driving its spread to other countries, finds Philip Sweeney\n\nVenezuela, once one of Latin America's richest and most animated countries, is grappling now with the unfolding Covid-19 crisis in which it is estimated to be one of the world's least medically prepared nations - and, much like the restaurant industry worldwide, the arrival of Venezuelan cooking on the international scene is on indefinite hold.\n\nIt's not often that a national dish comes with a side order of geopolitics and scuffling demonstrators, as is the case with the Venezuelan corn bun's bracing arrival on the London food scene. In January, a crowd of protesters with placards denouncing \"imperialist stooges\" surrounded the Bethnal Green cafe Arepa and Co, and people attending a function inside emerged to trade insults and throw beer.\n\nThe cause of the demonstration was the visit of a politician from Caracas: the suave 36-year-old opposition leader Juan Guaido, fresh from a meeting with Boris Johnson. Guaido led the singing of the Venezuelan national anthem and thanked London for welcoming him as it had Simon Bolivar, \"The Liberator\", two centuries earlier.\n\nThe presence of Guaido and Venezuelan food's growth around the world are in fact linked, as both are consequences of the collapse of a country whose vast oil wealth made it one of Latin America's richest and most cosmopolitan countries.\n\nIn 1999, Venezuela's then president, Hugo Chavez, installed the socialist regime whose current leader, Nicolas Maduro, has accelerated the ruin of the country's economy, driving 2.5 million citizens into exile.\n\nMaduro hangs on to power, backed by the army and a rump of nations led by Russia, China and Cuba. Meanwhile, Guaido claims to be the legitimate president and has the support of many countries, including the UK. So London, like most other capitals, now has two competing Venezuelan ambassadors.\n\nClouds and silver linings, though: the great Venezuelan diaspora has spread the country's food far and wide, with the arepa - while not exactly threatening the pizza - becoming increasingly visible. The dish has overtaken its more simple Colombian cousin - which is mostly filled with cheese or egg - of the same name, and is already familiar to Latin music lovers in the UK thanks to the food stalls at London concerts.\n\nUnlike the plain Colombian arepa, the Venezuelan version is stuffed with fillings such as ground beef, chicken, the ubiquitous grated cow's milk cheese from the llanos (plains), the guacamole equivalent guasaca, and aji pepper sauce. Other common Venezuelan dishes include tequenos (cheese-filled fried batons), cachapas (cornflour pancakes), and, especially around Christmas, the leaf-wrapped, steamed yuca parcels known as hallacas, a version of the pan-Latin tamales.\n\nA couple of months ago, arepas took a step into the British mainstream with the opening of Sabroso, the first areparia in a mass-market food court, at Westfield in Shepherd's Bush. Sabroso is the creation of two Venezuelan brothers, Gabriel and Jose-Luis Gonzalez, exiles from the early Chavez years, who started their catering career by surfing the wave of a fashion for Peruvian food, opening Lima Floral in Covent Garden, before noting that the geo-food climate was ripe for a fully commercial Venezuelan enterprise.\n\nLondon may be coming on nicely, but the rest of the UK is still a junior member of the Venezuelan food diaspora, with neighbouring Colombia the first to make a go of it. Imports have almost quadrupled for the special harina PAN - a brand of the unique yellow cornflour, related to polenta - which has become as much a Venezuelan cultural symbol as Bolivar's white horse.\n\nIn a recent visit to the city of Cartagena in Colombia, I sat outside a cafe - staffed by Venezuelan chefs and waiters - talking to a Venezuelan food researcher about the entrepreneurial flair of expatriate Venezuelans in supplying the extra tonnes of flour and other products. \"I was never personally attacked by regime militiamen\", the researcher said. \"The reason I left was that I'm a sociable guy and I realised one day that practically all my friends had gone.\"\n\nAfter Colombia and the great Latin melting pot of Miami, European destinations have also attracted Venezuelans who have had to leave the country. Chief among them is Madrid, where focal points include the Mercado de Maravillas, a big covered market in the somewhat Brixton-like district of Tetuan. Here I met stallholder Angel Mora, an anti-Maduro activist who left after a beating by militiamen and now sells imported products both to exiles and to the Maduro government's ambassador, who keeps a low profile but apparently sends his chauffeur for shopping.\n\nThe dozens of Venezuelan restaurants in Madrid now include interesting newcomers such as Apartaco and El Atelier de Dina, where the menu has gone far beyond arepas into the realms of regional specialities such as patacon - plantain - in a cheese, pepper and tomato sauce from the Caribbean coast, and dishes from the owner's native state such as cachalupa (a sort of pie of lasagne), pepito Larense (a bread pizza topped with veal, chicken and other ingredients), and breadcrumbed, fried llanera cheese with red-pepper jam that has nostalgic clients \"crying with emotion\". Even the venerable Complutense University of Madrid has entered the fray, with a research programme designing a carrot-enhanced, extra-nutritious arepa for the impoverished neighbourhoods of Caracas.\n\nIn the UK, we haven't yet got the regional specialities, never mind university-honed super-buns. Here the classic arepa still rules. Gabriel Gonzalez is fine tuning and slimming down his menu in Sabroso, introducing trios of mini-arepas, and a Latinised version of Hawaiian poke bowls - a sort of fusion of the poke's raw-fish ceviche and the Venezuelan national dish, pabellon criollo (a platter of rice, beans, plantains, meats and the spicy aji dipping sauce). Sabroso has also introduced a British touch, with cheddar or halloumi as alternatives to the Venezuelan cheese.\n\nSo what about exporting the concept back to its homeland? Not such a daft idea, in fact, as the upper end of the surprisingly complex Venezuelan catering scene has begun to recover.\n\nPart of the reason is that - in a new echo of Cuba, Venezuela's role model - Venezuelan citizens with access to US dollars are able to order a decent range of goods, while the hoi polloi have to queue to buy toilet paper with barrow-loads of bolivars, the almost worthless national currency.\n\nThe Venezuelan rum industry - which makes several internationally prized brands, notably Santa Teresa and Diplomatico - is in good health, however, as its citizens are obliged to abandon the increasingly expensive favourite, whisky.\n\nMight things one day reverse direction, with a restored country, a functioning government, and the opening of the first Caracas branch of Sabroso of London? \"Never say never,\" replies Gabriel Gonzalez, sounding simultaneously optimistic and incredulous. As indeed many Venezuelans might feel.","581":"How You Can Take Great Studio Portraits With No Modifiers at All | It is rare that a photographer will shoot studio portraits using a bare flash, but that does not mean you can't do it. In fact, you might be surprised by how you can accomplish with a bare flash, and the skills you will learn in practicing this will come in handy in a wide variety of situations outside the studio.\n\nComing to you from Lindsay Adler with Adorama TV, this excellent video will show you what you can accomplish when using a flash with no modifier. Generally, modifiers are used both to control the shape and fall-off of the light and to turn it into a larger source for softer, more flattering light. However, a bare flash can be more versatile than just functioning as a tiny source aimed straight at the subject. By learning how to bounce and diffuse its output, you can get a much wider range of results. This skill is especially useful for professionals who might not have the luxury of working with modifiers (wedding photographers, for example) and will help you improve your overall understanding of the way that light behaves. Check out the video above for the full rundown from Adler.","582":"How development of the 'self' in infants provides clues to the breakdown of memory in dementia The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations\n\nWhen we look in the mirror we see \"me\": a particular combination of features that matches our idea of who we are. We also feel the sensation that the movement of the self in the mirror is under our control - we have a sense of agency and ownership of the mirror image.\n\nBut the self we connect with in the mirror extends beyond the moment. Although our features age, we perceive the self in the mirror to be intimately connected to the child, the teenager, the young adult, that once stood before us in our reflection. We see them as the same person who will move forward into the future - the main character in the story of our lives.\n\nThis is surprising, since the self in the mirror is not only physically distinct from the self of the past, or the self of the future (our cells constantly age and replace), but cognitively distinct. Our mental processes mature, our choices, dreams and aspirations change - even our personalities are in constant flux.\n\nSo our perception of the self as a stable entity is illusory. The human mind is designed to tell us a coherent story of the world, consistent with past experience. Where there are gaps to be filled, the mind fills them. This is what leads some researchers and philosophers to think of the self as the ultimate illusion. But how does the \"self-illusion\" develop, and what happens when it dissolves?\n\nInfancy and memory\n\nWe are born subjective agents, capable of feeling sensations, experiencing positive and negative emotions and intentionally guiding our own actions. But it is not until the end of infancy that we are able to step outside of this first-hand experience of the self, cognitively reflecting on ourselves from a second-person perspective, as neatly illustrated by the onset of mirror self-recognition at two years of age.\n\nThe idea of \"me\" first captured by mirror recognition is made up of factual self-knowledge (including information about our physical features and personality traits) and autobiographical self-knowledge (including information about events which have happened to us in the past, and events planned for the future).\n\nThe \"me\" inherent in memory was recognised by early philosophers including Hume and Locke, and the relation between self and memory continues to guide modern theories of autobiographical processing. The close link between self and memory provides one explanation for the riddle of \"childhood amnesia\" - the fact that adults have no enduring memories prior to the age of two years.\n\nUntil children have an idea of \"me\" that enables them to anchor event memories, they are unlikely to be able to start to build and retrieve a personal life narrative. Our research measured four to six-year-old children's factual self-knowledge by asking them to provide self-descriptions, alongside their ability to \"label\" memories as their own (for example by recalling which of a set of actions they had performed, or which pictures had appeared with their own face). Together, these capacities were predictive of their ability to retrieve specific, autobiographical details of their lives (such as a full narrative of their first day of school or nursery).\n\nOur research therefore provides strong support for the idea that the development of autobiographical memory is dependent on the wider development of self-representation. But what does this close relationship between self and memory mean for the sense of self in old age, when memory may decline?\n\nDementia and the breakdown of self-recognition\n\nAround one in three people born in 2019 will suffer from dementia in their lifetime. One of the most distressing symptoms of this condition is the feeling of identity loss associated with the decline of autobiographical and\/or factual self-knowledge.\n\nFundamental breakdowns in self-recognition have been reported in late-stage dementia. Some sufferers fail to recognise themselves in photographs or mirrors, unable to connect their current experience of self to the self of the past. Does this breakdown in the self-illusion suggest that the self is lost? Not if we use the model of development to recognise the importance of agency - the first building block of the self.\n\nThe majority of dementia studies have focused on the link between conceptual self-recognition or autobiographical processing and identity, neglecting the idea of agency. However, behaving intentionally and having our intentions recognised by others is fundamental to our first experience of selfhood.\n\nDespite infants' relatively limited social repertoire, positive interactions that reinforce agency (such as soothing emotions and engaging in early conversations) are easily supported by parents and caregivers and are thought to be at the root of secure attachment relationships. Could this nurturing approach also be applied at the other end of the lifespan to maintain connections between people?\n\nWe are currently planning a series of studies to explore this possibility. The first step is to establish whether the dissolution of self follows the same steps as its development. If access to higher level self-representation (such as factual and autobiographical self-knowledge) is lost first, feelings of agency may be the last remaining facet of self.\n\nIf this is the case, ultimately it will be important to find ways to positively reinforce dementia sufferers' experience of their own actions (for example, by providing them with simple opportunities to have a positive effect on the world, such as moving their arms to activate music) and their emotional connection with caregivers (soothing negative emotions, laughing together), over and above conceptual aspects of self (such as prompts to recall self-knowledge).\n\nAlthough our second-person perspective on self may be illusory and we all experience ageing, our bodily self and the sense of agency it entails is built to make connections with the world, and carry us from cradle to grave.","583":"How do asylum seekers view Belgium's emergency system? The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations\n\nWhen we discuss of refugee issues or migration, media and scholars often focus on the motives that lie beneath such migrations and its relationship with the harsh debate taking place throughout Europe today.\n\nSome focus on the conditions under which migrants and asylum seekers are received in European countries, but only rarely are refugees' and migrants' words taken into account, their opinion or feelings about the reception system in Europe, its structure and its procedures.\n\nCitizen initiatives have played a major role\n\nSimilar to those of other European countries, Belgium's asylum system entered into crisis in 2015 under the pressure of an rising demands for international protection. The asylum system and its reception structures were seriously unprepared, despite the fact that the number of new applications was lower than that in the late 1990s and early 2000s (52,689 in 2014-2015, 78,470 in 1999\/2000), and that such increase was predictable since asylum trends have followed a cyclic pattern over the last 20 years.\n\nDecisions made by the Belgian government and the federal agency FEDASIL in the attempt to face the crisis went toward the simplification and generalisation of selection procedures, and the setting up of collective reception centres.\n\nCitizens' initiatives emerged as main support for migrants who arrived over the long summer of 2015. These initiatives often replaced institutions in answering the migrants' basic needs, hosting asylum seekers, distributing food or clothing and providing administrative and legal support. Mobilised citizens also went beyond the material dimension, and opened spaces for the migrants to regain the personal identity they had been forcibly denied throughout their journey, or had lost in the tangles of depersonalising administrative procedures.\n\n\"It took me a while to start doing normal things\"\n\nThroughout our field research, it emerged that while structures and procedures set up in a state of emergency brought to the dehumanisation of migrants, a process of rehumanisation has occurred in the relationship between them and mobilised citizens. As B. remarked:\n\n\"The journey doesn't end here. You arrive at the station, then you go to the police office. By bus to the centre. I've arrived, it was raining, a cold freezing night. [...] It took me a while to start doing normal things, thinking normal things. You become a number. [...] The people who come here from outside, I have many friends. I became a normal person again, thanks to them. I play football, we go out together, to the cinema. It's important, it's important you know. I made friends here.\"\n\nAlmost all the asylum seekers and de facto refugees who participated to our study highlighted the arbitrary nature and inherent injustice of the asylum system. Their personal background, including the compelling reasons and tragic circumstances that pushed them to leave their homes, crumbled under the weight of the selection procedure.\n\nThe interview at the Commissioner General for Refugees and Stateless Persons (CGVS\/RA), responsible for the in-depth examination of asylum applications, is the main practice through which migrants are stripped of their personal identity. Said A., who was living in the Namur reception centre in May 2018 after two years and one negative decision from the CGVS\/RA.\n\n\"There is you, with your story, the journey, the family behind. It doesn't matter, they don't care. They ask you questions, other questions. They want to trip you out, keep asking the same question again and again, until you get confused. [Then] they will say you are fake refugee, and you get a negative, no matter what you have gone through before getting there.\"\n\nThe standard procedure provides that applicants for international protection who have been denied the refugee status or subsidiary protection can lodge an appeal with the Council of State. If decision remains unchanged, an order to leave the territory is issued. Applications, interviews, appeals and the whole procedure can take years.\n\nLiving in a frozen time and space\n\nTemporality is key in the feelings and frustrations of migrants. As we have remarked in our interviews, most feel the time has frozen. The reception centres represent the concrete spatial dimension that shapes this sense of being stucked: a perception of immobility, uncertainty and powerlessness.\n\nTemporality is central to the way asylum seekers experience the process of selection as dehumanising and arbitrary. A long wait is suddenly interrupted by short moments in which procedures reactivate and migrants are suddenly required to be proactive. Again, the interview at CGVS\/RA is the element around which the negative feelings of our interviewees revolve:\n\n\"What do they want? You wait for months and one day you get called by the commissariat. Before, you've been thinking about it every day, but then you want to start living a normal life. [...] One day you get called, and you gotta go there and answer their questions. They ask questions like a machine gun. [...] They want you to get back on your dossier, but you're tired. You're tired.\"\n\nAfter long time waiting in collective structures, migrants may end up looking with fear at life outside. Even when they gain their status, they have lost familiarity with interpersonal contacts, daily chores and life matters. Disorientation is even more intense for those who reside in structures far away from urban centres:\n\n\"Do you imagine living here for one year? It's in the middle of fields here, it takes hours to get to the city, no bus on weekend. [...] After a while you get used to this life, and you feel like you don't need anything else. But this is not life, this is not normal. I saw people going crazy when they had to leave. [...] They were happy, of course, but also scared. They didn't know what they were getting into.\"\n\n\"Looking at each other like the fish at the market\"\n\nSelection practices are another important source of frustration. The principle of selection, after all, is pivotal in the way contemporary democracies aim to manage global migration flows, and is central in the migration debate since the 1950s.\n\nWhat characterises the refugee question, and the 2015 reception crisis in particular, is the extreme simplification and generalisation of criteria. In 2015, the European Commission reopened debate on the creation of a list of \"safe countries of origin\" for asylum seekers. Belgium followed in 2016. S., a Senegalese man waiting for first decision, showed us all his disappointment and frustration toward the system and the selection criteria adopted by CGVS\/RA. According to him, the asylum procedure would have a disruptive effect on the interpersonal relationships in the reception centre:\n\n\"We end up looking at each other like the fish at the market, you know. Those who are good, those who are bad. The only thing that counts is where you are from [...] if they say your country is safe you can forget about it. [...] You see people coming and going here, but you know some will stay ages [in the reception centre], and some will never be accepted. [...] It's unfair, it's wrong sometimes. I saw poor people, people in need who deserved it, getting rejected, and then bad people getting in. You don't look at people for what they are, you become jealous, you start hating others.\"\n\nOur interviewees expressed fears for not being considered as individuals whose rights must be guaranteed under any specific circumstance. Rather, they only felt categorised between those who are \"at risk\" or those who are \"safe\", those who are \"legitimate\" and those who are \"illegitimate\".\n\n\"They did not give a shit that I was tortured\"\n\nInstitutions in charge of selection focus on the analysis and permanent verification of the authenticity of the personal profiles of applicants. A translator hired to assist asylum seekers during interviews at CGVS\/RA, remarked that much effort is put to verify that the applicant comes from the region or city from which he\/she claims to be coming.\n\nAccording to our source, however, the staff hired during the reception crisis received only superficial training and was largely unprepared about the different geographical and cultural origins of asylum seekers. Often, the analysis and verification of profiles are thus perceived by applicants as a search for inconsistent elements in their discourse, rather than in accurate collection and analysis of their background and motivations to claim asylum:\n\n\"They keep asking me that question again and again. I go forward, they ask more questions, then they go back to that silly question again. [...] What colour was the uniform of prison guards when you were locked up in there?[...] I was tortured! They did not give a shit that I was tortured, they just wanted me to get confused. You can't say I don't remember.\"\n\nThe inefficiency of the state of emergency\n\nWe are convinced that what we heard from the migrants who took part to our study is mainly caused by the state of emergency in which the Belgian federal government, as well as the whole European Union, had to operate during and after the summer of 2015.\n\nWe keep asking ourselves whether this state of emergency is functional to the anti-immigration approach of many governments, and the trends toward strict selection of migration that fascinate political leaders today.\n\nIn the beginning of 2018, Belgium's federal government sought to reduce the reception network, only to reverse course when migrations resumed in the summer period. With ill-concealed criticism toward the government's policy, FEDASIL director Jean-Pierre Luxen defined the increase in demands as \"sadly predictable\" in the foreword of the FEDASIL 2018 annual report.\n\nIn this scenario, what we can suggest as researchers (and as human beings, citizens and taxpayers) is to opt for well-planned alternative forms of reception based on local small(er)-scale solutions, with the aim to promote interpersonal contact with citizens and to foster the future integration of asylum seekers in our societies.","584":"How five short intentions can help people recovering from depression stay on track The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations\n\nAbout one in six people in England report experiencing anxiety or depression in any given week, and depression is a major cause of disability worldwide.\n\nSome people have experienced very adverse experiences over their lives, leading to low self-esteem and other vulnerabilities which can make people susceptible to depression. Difficult life circumstances, such as financial problems, loneliness, stresses at work, among family or in relationships, poor physical health and genetic vulnerabilities also contribute. Even long-term depression can be treated, but the lifetime risk that the depression returns has been reported as about 50% for those experiencing one episode of major depression, with the likelihood increasing with further episodes.\n\nGreater numbers of people experiencing mental health problems, and greater awareness of effective treatments, has increased demand for services. In recent years this has led to investment through the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme, but because of huge demand, waiting times can still be a problem and it's important that we develop new ways of helping people manage and overcome their mental health problems - to prevent problems occurring in the first place, and to prevent them returning. A lot of this comes down to teaching people to help themselves more effectively.\n\nTo some extent this is already happening, for example with increases in self-help support within mental health services, and the use of self-help websites, online support and apps. Working with NHS staff, we have developed the Self-Management after Therapy intervention, or SMArT, designed to help people to stay well after they have recovered from an episode of depression.\n\nLike other relapse-prevention approaches, it assumes that many people continue to remain vulnerable to depression. Recovery is seen as a process that continues after the end of therapy that has its ups and downs. This approach helps prevent someone from feeling they are back to square one if they have a setback, a frame of mind that can increase the likelihood of a return to more severe depression.\n\nThe approach, first developed by psychologist Peter Gollwitzer in the 1990s, has been found to support changes in behaviour, such as quitting smoking or doing more physical activity, through what are called implementation intentions. It is designed to help people turn an intention to act into a habitual behaviour. We know how hard it can be to make good intentions a reality (such as practically every New Year's resolution), and when someone's mood and motivation are low it can be even harder. As one mental health service user said during our research: \"I know what to do, but when I'm down I just don't do it.\"\n\nImplementation intentions work by linking a specific situation to a specific response. For example: \"Every evening between 7pm and 9pm I will write down all the positive things that have happened that day,\" or \"Every Thursday evening I will go to the pub quiz with my friend Katy\". They often take the form of \"if ..., then ...\" statements, such as: \"If I feel down, then I will talk to my partner about why this might be.\"\n\nWhen the situation comes up, the learned response is brought to mind, and is therefore more likely to be acted out. Using our SMArT intervention, people are encouraged to identify up to five of these implementation intentions. It's important that they are realistic and that they will have an impact on the person's wellbeing. The best way of thinking about them is to consider five things you do on a regular basis that are important to you. Then, imagine how you would feel if you didn't do them. That is what tends to happen in depression, or when a person is at risk of a relapse.\n\nThe use of the SMArT intervention is supported in mental health services by psychological wellbeing practitioners, and patients are encouraged to share their intentions with friends or family who can support them.\n\nSMArT is just one of a number of ways of helping people who are prone to depression to stay well and we're carrying out more research to see how effective it is. It provides a bridge between the end of therapy and life without therapy and helps people see the importance of setting plans and having routine in their lives. It also emphasises that recovery is a process that includes learning about oneself and self-management strategies. It is something for the long-term - not just for all-too-soon-abandoned New Year's resolutions.","585":"How good are these Twins with the unexpectedly good record? The question I keep getting asked if whether the Twins are really as good as their current record.\n\nThe answer is no.\n\nAt their current pace, going into Saturday's game in Chicago, the Twins would finish with a 91-71 record. I don't think the Twins are a 20-games-above-.500 team as currently constructed, nor as they could be constructed with any combination of players currently available to them. I'm guessing you don't either.\n\nHowever, I do think we're on the verge of a summer of interesting and relevant baseball.\n\nI can't guarantee it. But I'm pretty sure the Twins are better than we were willing to give them credit for as the season approached. There are flaws scattered throughout the roster, but so far there have also been antidotes to those flaws.\n\nFlaw: Danny Santana playing a scary shortstop. Antidote: Enough offense to overcome some of the runs to which he's contributed to through his messy defensive play.\n\nFlaw: Phil Hughes struggling more often than you'd want from the No. 1 pitcher on the staff. Antidote: The rest of the rotation is OK. (The rotation's ERA is ninth in the American league.)\n\nFlaw: Waiting for Joe Mauer to be more excellent than average. Read that as his current 100 OPS+ vs. his career 132 figure. (Here's an OPS+ definition - or refresher - if you need it.) . Antidote: Trevor Plouffe and Torii Hunter sandwiching Mauer in the batting order and stepping up pretty consistently.\n\nIn the recent seasons of agony, whatever good wasn't nearly enough to balance off the bad. The good ball stats don't lie ... and those weren't kind to the Twins.\n\nSo what now?\n\nThe reason I can only offer measured optimism instead of something giddier is mostly because of the challenge presented by the Twins bullpen. The Twins are carrying 13 pitchers right now and eight of them are relievers. Of those eight, however, they are as scary as they are solid. How often do you want Brain Duensing pitching in key situations? Michael Tonkin? Tim Stauffer? J.R. Graham (despite his excellent midweek outing in Pittsburgh)?\n\nThat leaves Glen Perkins, Blaine Boyer, Aaron Thompson and Ryan Pressly as relievers who don't scare me. Casey Fien will be joining the good group soon and at some point the 13-pitcher staff will be cut back to 12 again. Of that group, only Perkins and Fien have proven themselves over a full season.\n\nThe Twins fell short with their needed bullpen makeover in the offseason. Many of the good things won't matter if the Twins don't have an adequate bridge from their starters to the trustier end-game relievers. Paul Molitor danced successfully with the staff through the 13-inning victory at Pittsburgh on Wednesday but didn't have the same good fortune Friday in Chicago, when he tried Thompson and Tonkin in a tie game.\n\nThe offense isn't always going to be good enough to overcome the team's mistakes. And Friday's loss, in addition to the three-hit offense, was fueled by a poor play on a ground ball between Hughes and Mauer, as well as the awful 0-and-2 breaking ball Hughes threw to weak-hitting Geovany Soto that he lined for a two-run double. The bullpen failed to pick up for those problems.\n\nBefore I'm willing to get too excited, the Twins need to show me a Bullpen 2.0. The current bullpen is 13 of the 15 American League teams in ERA and tied for last in opponents' slugging percentage. Given the excellent work by Perkins, the very good work by Boyer and the good-enough work of Thompson and Pressly, those numbers are skewed by the others.\n\nDo you want to see the bullpen I covet? It's right here, with five frequent contributors who have allowed one baserunner or less per inning, and a staff WHIP of .96.\n\nThe one-quarter mark of the season is the time when teams start looking at track record and make some revisions for the long haul. Moving Alex Meyer to the Class AAA bullpen was one hint of what could be coming. Jose Berrios and Tommy Milone could force their way into the rotation and force more changes in the bullpen alignment.\n\nPicking up the right reinforcements for the bullpen is a doable challenge. I think the Twins can get by for a spell with the current group, but there will be a time when more reliable arms will be needed more often than they are right now, especially if the Twins keep playing games that matter.\n\nThe good news is we're talking like this instead of throwing up (our arms) in disgust and wishing for minor-league calls-up just for the sake of excitement. Let's see how long the Twins can make moves that are based in playing relevant baseball.\n\nLet's call that a victory for now. Let's also expect improvement.","586":"How is Rob Gronkowski not a unanimous NFL All-Decade tight end? By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy\n\nUsually it feels like splitting hairs: Guy gets voted to prestigious list or hall. Guy doesn't get every committee member's vote. If you've been successfully voted in, does it matter if you made it by two votes or 25?\n\nBut there are occasions where it's worth wondering what happened with the voting.\n\nWe saw it earlier this year with Derek Jeter's vote into Cooperstown -- the New York Yankees legend was one vote shy of being a unanimous selection.\n\nIt caused an uproar in baseball, and as noted by Yahoo Sports colleague Mike Oz, it's likely that uproar and the social media abuse or worse that would have been directed to the lone dissenter that has led to him or her not revealing themselves.\n\nThe NFL All-Decade team for the 2010s isn't exactly the Hall of Fame, though a player's placement on one does play a role in whether they're eventually elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\n\nAmong the 55 honorees announced Monday, eight were unanimously voted -- Tom Brady, Adrian Peterson, J.J. Watt, among others. But the one player who seems an obvious pick, was not a unanimous vote-getter: former Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski.\n\nThe team was chosen by the 48 members of the Hall of Fame selection committee, and only players who had been named to at least one Pro Bowl, Associated Press All-Pro team or Pro Football Writers of America all-conference team during the 10 seasons were eligible for consideration. Exact vote counts are not released.\n\nAgain, Gronkowski did make the team (the Chiefs' Travis Kelce was the other tight end to make it). And no, the selection committee doesn't have an easy job.\n\nAt most positions.\n\nGronkowski should have been a slam dunk, or a Gronk Spike, if you prefer.\n\nGronkowski, listed at 6-foot-6, 270 pounds in his playing days, looked like Ivan Drago. He looked like a player you'd create in Madden, when you had free rein to make the most physically perfect tight end you could think of. He was far too big for cornerbacks to tackle effectively, too fast for most linebackers to keep up with.\n\nGronkowski played nine seasons in the 2010s, and due to injuries only played 115 of a possible 144 regular-season games. Having had a front-row press box seat for his first five seasons, I can confidently say few players were beat up the way he was and given as little protection. Gronkowski needed back surgery, broke the same arm twice and suffered a torn ACL in 2013 when he took a direct hit to the knee from an opposing defensive back, the type of injury you knew was coming someday from a player desperate to cut him down.\n\nIt was the same during the 2011 playoffs, when he suffered multiple torn ankle ligaments on a tackle against the Baltimore Ravens in the AFC championship.\n\nIn four of the five seasons in which he played 14 or more games, Gronkowski was voted first-team All-Pro. His tour de force 2011 season saw him set the single-season record for receiving yards and touchdowns by a tight end, with 1,327 and 17, respectively. His 17 touchdowns led the league that season, the first time a tight end had claimed that title. His would-be 18th was ruled a rushing touchdown when Tom Brady's lateral was deemed behind the line of scrimmage.\n\nHis touchdowns set him apart as arguably the best red-zone player ever: 79 receiving touchdowns are third-most all-time at the position, with only Antonio Gates (116) and Tony Gonzalez (111) in front of him. Gates got to that number over 16 seasons, Gonzalez 17.\n\nIn all, Gronkowski had four 1,000-yard seasons, totaling 521 catches for 7,861 yards and 80 total touchdowns in the regular season. In a full season's worth of career playoff games, 16, he had 81 receptions for 1,163 yards and 12 scores.\n\nBeyond the gaudy numbers, Gronkowski could do what many tight ends now don't: He was stellar as a run blocker, making him a true three-down offensive player. In 2015, the only Patriots player who played more offensive snaps than Brady (98.8 percent) was Gronkowski (84 percent); in his last season, 2018, only Brady and the offensive linemen played more.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd if all of that weren't enough, just look at the Patriots' offense last fall, its first without Gronkowski. It was clearer than ever how much of an asset he was.\n\nOh, and Gronkowski was on the NFL 100 team, among the 100 greatest players in the game's history.\n\nWe don't want to name and shame the person or persons who left Gronkowski off their all-decade ballot. That's not cool. But it's really hard to think there are those who watched the NFL during the 2010s, saw Gronkowski even a handful of times and didn't think \"there's one of the best tight ends that's ever played,\" let alone the best of the last decade.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:\n\nBest Team Ever bracket: Championship round voting now open\n\nGronk, WWE champion: Ex-Pats star wins belt at WrestleMania 36\n\nBritish Open officially canceled; other PGA Tour events in flux\n\nHall of Famer Mitchell, who helped integrate Redskins, dies at 84","587":"How many families will get COVID-19 cash aid? - Rizal acting governor The social welfare department should clarify how many families in a province are entitled to cash aid from the government during the Luzon-wide lockdown to contain COVID-19, Rizal acting governor Junrey San Juan said Tuesday.\n\nThe agency only gave a \"limited\" number of barcoded forms that cannot be photocopied for the social amelioration program (SAP).

How many times have you forgotten where you parked the car? A few years ago, probably as a sign that my retirement was overdue, I spent literally half a day trying to find my car at a major New York airport. Fortunately, I am not alone. When people find out I am an expert on memory, the first thing they ask me is normally whether I can help them be less forgetful.\n\nIndeed, excessive forgetting is a major problem, but \"normal\" forgetting is actually necessary. After all, it is more crucial to remember what is important right now than to remember everything. There's no point in remembering the phone number of the house you lived in 10 years ago - that may in fact block your memory for your current phone number.\n\nBut exactly how the brain forgets unnecessary memories has long been unclear. Now a beautiful and rather exhaustive series of studies, just published in Science, offers a clue.\n\nResearch does indeed show that, in order to remember what is important, we need to forget what isn't important. This can happen at two levels in the brain, a \"cleaning\" of irrelevant information as we retain and consolidate our memories, and a \"blocking\" of irrelevant information when we try to retrieve a memory. The positive effect on memory of blocking irrelevant information has been known since the 1950s.\n\nThe new study, which was carried out in mice, seems to finally reveal the secret mechanisms of forgetting during retention of memory. The authors claim that forgetting is due to the activation of specific \"melatonin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons\" located in the brain's hypothalamus, which is involved in releasing hormones. We know that melatonin affects sleep - and MCH neurons are indeed involved in the shift between the two main sleep cycles: NREM to REM (REM sleep commonly associated with dreaming).\n\nThe authors demonstrate that forgetting happens only during retention (not when we encode or retrieve memories), and that sleep is the period of the day when MCH neurons clean the memory of all the irrelevant clutter. They obtained the results by injecting chemicals into the brain of mice in order to inhibit these very neurons. Amazingly, the mice performed better on two specific memory tasks as a result - recognising new objects and a fear conditioning test (this involves making association between stimuli and their adverse consequences).\n\nWhat's more, when the researchers completely removed these neurons from the brain, the mice's memory also improved, over the long term. On the other hand, a boosted activity of these neurons instead hindered the mice's memory performance. The researchers therefore argue that the neuronal process may one day be used to treat memory problems.\n\nRead more: Why do you feel like you're falling when you go to sleep?\n\nThis finding, if true and confirmed by other studies, represents a major breakthrough in understanding a fundamental memory mechanism. The methodology is rigorous and results convincing. There are some caveats though. How can we be absolutely sure that these neurons are involved in cleaning out irrelevant information in particular, rather than just impairing memory performance?\n\nIt seems that MCH neurons, when activated, just impair memory - and not necessarily with a good effect. This is important: the results do not say much about the positive role of forgetting during retention. In addition, whose memory are we talking about here? Mice memory - and necessarily so, given the highly invasive nature of most of the reported experiments. While animal models are indispensable for memory studies, it is too early to extend these findings to human memory.\n\nFor example, in humans the role of sleep in memory is still unclear. Also, forgetting occurs during retrieval of memories too and that is not explained by this new research.\n\nNevertheless, the new study does show for the first time that MCH neurons are strongly involved in making memory worse. That said, while we are on an exciting track thanks to this research, it is highly unlikely that we can improve human memory for a parked car by simply inhibiting a few neurons.","589":"How the news media played down the pandemics of yore, from Spanish flu to Swine flu Before the explosion of social media, pandemic news was more sedate.\n\nWhen it comes to COVID-19, social media is a fire hose of facts, fears and fabrications. It'll jazz you up and calm you down. It'll make you scowl at toilet paper hoarders one minute, then bolt off to the store the next.\n\nIt was different in the age when people got their news from, well, newspapers. If you examine the archives to see how papers reported on the pandemics of yore -- 1918, 1957, 1968, 2009 -- you see how the culture is reflected in the tone. And you can't help concluding that either they were made of sterner stuff than us, or they really didn't know what they were up against. Or both.\n\nSpanish flu, 1918. The last grueling death rattle of World War I dominated the papers, not the flu. Which is not to say papers ignored it. They ran poems about it. Humorous poems, at that, mocking hypochondriacs and panic-mongers. And when they did take it seriously, it could backfire. The Winnipeg Tribune ran a front-page story about shop owners blaming the paper for hyping the flu and ruining business.\n\nThe occasional alarming anecdote would turn up. An item in the Minneapolis Morning Tribune on Oct. 30, 1918, has a raw, despairing quality absent in nearly every other story on the epidemic.\n\n\"A letter from a small town in the east says: 'People are dying by the hundreds here. They cannot dig graves fast enough, and there is a shortage of caskets. I don't know what we will do if this keeps up; it seems they will have to bury the dead without coffins.' That's how terrible the Spanish Influence is in some locations.\"\n\nThat was not a news story, though. That was an ad for an anti-flu nostrum that was literally called Snake Oil -- in case you wondered how bogus meds got that name.\n\nThe papers noted the number of reported flu cases, the local deaths, the closings -- but the stories were small. Wartime censorship kept a lid on bad news that might dent home-front morale. Plus, the appetite for death tolls and harrowing predictions was not abundant in a population exhausted by war news.\n\nAsian flu, 1957. On July 4, 1957, a headline in the Minneapolis Morning Tribune said, \"Minnesota Keeps an Eye Out for Asian flu.\"\n\nThe story:\n\n\"Minnesota health officials are on the alert for Asian flu. They are awaiting the result of a laboratory check on some 100 suspected cases that broke out in the past week at a Grinnell, Iowa, youth meeting. If the Iowa cases turn out to be Asian flu, it will be the disease's first United States appearance outside apparent cases on both east and west coasts.\"\n\nThat would seem to be important, no? Apparently not that important; the story ran on page 23.\n\nAccording to the Des Moines Tribune on Aug. 16, it was Asian flu, and there were 200 suspected cases. But the story was headlined \"Asian Flu Fails to Hit Iowa Hard,\" and it ran on page 15, with the movie reviews and traffic accident reports.\n\nThe Morning Tribune ran a few stories about the Asian flu in July 1957. They included a news brief about an outbreak that sickened hundreds in Syria and an editorial calling for calm and praising the efforts of the World Health Organization and the U.S. public health services.\n\nThat was the official mood of the times: Our top people are on it. We have tools now. But there might have been something else at work, too, when you consider that people had endured the polio epidemic. Nature always had something nasty up its sleeve. Grit your teeth, wait and pray.\n\nBy August, the story was front-page material, but the stories discussed the new vaccine and its imminent arrival. The flu was always in the paper, but it was reported with as much emotion as the livestock prices. By the time the virus had run its course, the death toll in the United States was about 116,000. (Keep in mind that the population was only about half of what it is now, 172 million compared with an estimated 331 million.)\n\nHong Kong flu, 1968: The Asian flu permuted into a new variety, H3N2, also known as the Hong Kong flu. Stories about it started popping up in November and December, and again, the media had a business-as-usual tone. There were larger tales to tell -- the journey to the moon, the trouble in Vietnam.\n\nSaid an Associated Press report on Dec. 27, 1968:\n\n\"Deaths attributed to the Hong Kong flu more than doubled across the nation in the third week of December. ... Official figures for the week showed roughly 500 more 'pneumonia-influenced' deaths recorded in 122 cities.\"\n\nThe story ran on page 24. Hong Kong flu eventually would kill 100,000 people in the United States.\n\nSwine flu, 2009: On April 25, the Star Tribune ran a front-page story of a flu epidemic in Mexico that had hit Texas and California. Two days later, on the top of the front page, was a report of more new cases, all over the planet. \"It's not a time to panic,\" said the headline, quoting the White House.\n\nThis was H1N1, and the initial impact seemed mild. In the second week of June, the state was reporting 30 new cases a day, but there was a general shrug about it. At the time, according to a Star Tribune graphic, there were about 14,000 cases in the United States. And then it died out.\n\nBut it came back in the fall. There was a vaccine, but there wasn't enough. \"Vaccine rollout fuels anxiety,\" read a headline, displaying a different tone than the headlines of earlier years. Anxiety about the authorities' ability to cope was not the part you said out loud back then. President Barack Obama's Oct. 25 announcement of a \"national flu emergency\" made the front page, but it wasn't the top story.\n\nThe third paragraph noted that over 1,000 people had died from the flu.\n\nThere was a vaccine soon enough, but the rollout was plagued with glitches and ineffective batches. Nonetheless, the story did not dominate every page of the news or roil the markets. A few activities shut down -- a summer camp here, a meeting there. A graduation ceremony had to make do with fist-bumps instead of handshakes. The news didn't seem apocalyptic.\n\nSo why is COVID-19 getting such different treatment from the media?\n\nPerhaps this is a unique intersection of a more virulent strain appearing at a point when social media and global interconnectivity amplifies everything. It's hard to bear the bad news, and it makes you wish someone would write a humorous poem.","590":"How to Adjust to Work-From-Home Life - The Simple Dollar There are a lot of people all over the world that are suddenly adjusting to working from home. It can be a major shift from working in an office or even from working at a library or cafe, as some do. It's a major change, shifting from an environment with lots of coworkers and a frequently-present boss to working in an environment where you're by yourself most of the time with occasional contact with coworkers and supervisors via phone calls, videoconferences and other forms of digital communication.\n\nI've been working from home for twelve years and, along the way, I've learned a lot of things about how to do it effectively. What follows is something of a \"beginner's guide\" to working from home, collecting together much of what I've learned over the years.\n\nLet's dig in.\n\nIt's absolutely vital that you have borders on your work time at home, for a whole bunch of reasons.\n\nThe big reason is that having clear start and end times prevents work from bleeding into the rest of your life and just completely taking over your time. Without those borders, it's easy to gradually become a workaholic. Trust me -- I know this from painful experience. Even worse, if you go through a workaholic period, it's very likely that things will snap the other way and you'll find yourself completely burnt out and procrastinating everything, which is perhaps even worse.\n\nBeyond that, having clear start and end times provides good cues for the other people in your life. This isn't as important if you're at home by yourself, but if you have others in your family living with you, it's very useful for them to know when you're going to start working and when you're going to stop working, so that they know when you can easily be interrupted and when they need to leave you alone.\n\nFor example, I can clearly say to my children that I'll be working from 9 a.m. to noon each day, eat lunch with them, and then be working from 1 to 5 p.m. each day. They can watch the clock and know when their dad will be available to them and when to leave him alone so he can get work done.\n\nHaving clear start and stop times also provides a good mental transition for you, something I'm going to get back to in a bit. Knowing that you're \"on the clock\" during those hours means that you know, at any given point in the day, where your mind should be focused. You also have a clear idea when you should be wrapping things up.\n\nHere are some good suggestions for choosing start and end times.\n\nMake sure that the times encompass any periods when you will need to communicate with coworkers. If there are regular meetings or phone calls during the day, make sure that your working hours include those meetings.\n\nBe aware of your own energy levels and times of peak focus. Some people are \"morning people\" -- I'm definitely one of them. Others are evening people or even nighttime people. You are going to find working from home most effective if at least some of your working time is in your personal time of best focus. In other words, if you feel like there are mashed potatoes in your head in the mornings, don't have your work time in the mornings. Do other things in the morning, and get down to work when you're better able to focus.\n\nBe aware of the sleep schedules and routines of others who live with you. This doesn't mean that you should work while they're sleeping or anything like that, but knowing when they're likely to be loud and to want to interact with you is really useful when figuring out start and end times.\n\nIncorporate breaks. I take a roughly 10-minute break every hour to refill my water, stretch a little, go to the bathroom and look at distracting things for five minutes. I don't set an alarm for this, but I simply do it at the top of each hour. That way, if I get into a \"zone\" and am really focused on my work, alarms don't disrupt me and I can keep working until my focus breaks.\n\nI also usually have a longer break about halfway through the day. For me, that usually means lunchtime, along with some sort of quick break activity, which might be a short game with my kids, some exercise or simply reading a chapter or two of a book.\n\nMuch like how it's useful to have a distinct workday schedule where you're working during certain hours, it's also very useful to have a distinct workspace in your home, a place where you sit (or stand) when working that you generally don't use for any other purpose.\n\nHaving that kind of distinct workspace becomes a mental trigger of sorts, so when you're at this spot, you're supposed to be working. The reverse is, of course, true -- when you're not at that spot, you're not working.\n\nI have two workspaces in my home. One is a standing desk in the basement, while the other is a chair on the main floor near some windows. I generally only spend time in those spots if I'm working (I do occasionally sit in the sunny chair, but I'm almost never at my standing desk outside of work time). When I'm in those spots, work is what I'm focused on. I just know, because of where I'm at, that I need to be working.\n\nIt's worth noting that your workspace doesn't have to be a permanent desk with tons of materials all over the place. I actually keep most of my work materials, aside from my computer, in a backpack that I call my \"portable office,\" which goes with me wherever I need it. Consider keeping all of your work materials in a bag or other container so that they don't dominate table space in your home. I'll mention this again in a bit.\n\nHere's how to find a good workspace for you.\n\nIt's really important to have a mindset that you're \"working\" now and you're not just at home, or else you will find yourself constantly drawn into domestic tasks and distractions. Just like your mindset used to switch when you went to work, your mindset still needs to switch even though you're not changing locations.\n\nIn my previous professional life, my commute was my big step in transitioning from a \"home\" mindset to a \"work\" mindset, but when you work from home, you don't have that commute anymore. You need to find something to replace that mindset switch.\n\nHere are some common elements of \"home\" to \"work\" transitions, many of which I use.\n\nThe key is to make sure that you do these little things each day, not only to get ready for the day, but to serve as a mental signal to yourself that it's time to switch from \"home life\" to \"work life.\"\n\nSimilarly, it's good to have a few things you do each day to signify the transition back from a work mindset to a home mindset.\n\nDo a final review of your to-do list. Go through your to-do list and calendar and make sure there isn't anything else that needs to be done.\n\nSet up things so that you can easily pick up your work tomorrow. Figure out what you'll work on first tomorrow and take the initial steps so that sliding into that task is really easy. For me, I usually find it's good to leave an outlined article for tomorrow.\n\nClean up your work area. Pack up your stuff and get it out of the way so that it's not taking up table space and is \"out of sight, out of mind.\"\n\nAgain, these steps are useful in their own right, but they're also valuable in terms of switching your mindset from \"work\" to \"home.\"\n\nPlan something truly enjoyable to do each evening, something you look forward to doing throughout the day, as a mental reward for staying on task.\n\nI usually think of it in terms of my to-do list. For example, I'll decide that if I take care of these four big to-do items today, I'll spend an hour reading a book purely for fun, play a board game I'm excited to play or I'll make a loaf of homemade bread. All of those are things that I personally deeply enjoy; you should think of your own things.\n\nThese should be distinct, relaxing activities that you enjoy, but something more than just channel surfing or web surfing or browsing social media or playing with your phone. Instead, think of something you'd really enjoy doing this evening and make that your target.\n\nFor example, as I'm writing this, my planned leisure for this evening -- provided I take care of what needs to be done during my workday -- is to spend 60 to 90 minutes playing an online game with a few friends. We're going to turn on microphones and cameras and chat while playing a multiplayer online game. These are people that I normally hang out with on a weekly basis, but haven't seen in a while, so I'm really looking forward to it. It's my reward for getting the work done today, and having that fun when I know that I took care of business today makes it even easier to relax and just enjoy it.\n\nYour home is chock full of distractions. (Of course, your workplace may have been full of them before, but the ones at home are different.) Your phone is a distraction. All of the fun things you might want to do at home are distractions. The internet is a distraction. The chores you need to get done around the house are a distraction. Distractions, everywhere.\n\nDistractions are the absolute bane of getting work tasks done at home. The more distractions you have around that pull your attention away from work, the more time everything will take and the fewer things you'll get done in a given day.\n\nThe solution, then, is to kill distractions, or at least as many as you can.\n\nHere are some things that work really well for me in terms of killing and minimizing distractions while working.\n\nI've often had young children at home with me during various times of my work-at-home experience. Here's what I learned along the way.\n\nWorking at home is hard, especially at first. The environment is new. All of the work routines are upset. You feel constantly distracted, both because of the new environment and because of the life changes that led to this point.\n\nYou can do this. I didn't think I could pull this off at first, either, and my initial trials with working at home were disastrous. As I slowly began to put all of these strategies in place (mostly through gradual discovery of them for myself), it got easier and easier. It will for you, too.","591":"How to Boost Your Productivity with Block Scheduling Founder and CEO of JotForm, sharing entrepreneurship and productivity tips at Lifehack. Read full profile\n\nOn August 6, 1991, the world changed forever. That's when the internet became publicly available. Less than 30 years later, our lives have been irrevocably transformed. We can now learn, explore, and communicate 24\/7, which is both amazing and, as we all know, hazardous to our productivity.\n\nTo be clear, the internet isn't life's only distraction. And while productivity has become a huge buzzword in recent years, it's simply a measure of progress: are you doing what matters most? Actively moving toward your goals?\n\nAuthor Neil Pasricha writes in Harvard Business Review,\n\n\"As our world gets busier and our phones get beepier, the scarcest resource for all of us is becoming attention and creative output. And if you're not taking time to put something new and beautiful out in the world, then your value is diminishing fast.\"\n\nMost entrepreneurs relate deeply to this sentiment. Pasricha solved his own productivity challenges by instituting \"untouchable days\" that shield him from texts, phone calls, meetings, alerts, or appointments of any kind. He says these focused sessions have enabled him to produce his most creative and rewarding work.\n\nI love Pasricha's approach, but it's not always realistic for me. As the founder and CEO of JotForm, I need to weigh in on a variety of daily decisions, from hiring to product roadmaps to financial planning. I suspect other founders feel the same way. Yet, I do believe in the power of focused work, which is also why I recommend block scheduling.\n\nEntrepreneurs often flaunt their multitasking as a badge of honor. After all, starting a business is a tug-of-war between competing priorities. But while multitasking might feel efficient, research shows that shifting between tasks can slash productivity by up to 40%. Task-switching leaves what Dr. Sophie Leroy calls \"attention residue,\" which means we're still thinking about a previous activity while we start the next one.\n\nHere's where block scheduling can shine. Also called block scheduling or time blocking, it's the practice of allocating large chunks of time to related tasks. For example, you might designate Mondays for meetings and Tuesdays for strategy. There are many different approaches, which we'll get to shortly.\n\nFirst, here's why it matters. Business is essentially problem-solving. Creating strategies, writing code, developing products, and all the myriad activities that entrepreneurs tackle demand focus and minimal distractions. They're also inherently human tasks that won't easily be replaced by AI, which means your business depends on your ability to go deep.\n\nEntrepreneurs use their minds to launch ideas and create value, so the ability to concentrate is \"almost like a superpower.\"\n\nBlock scheduling can also help you to produce higher quality work in less time. Parkinson's Law holds that \"work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion,\" which is why setting time limits can deflate a ballooning task. Other benefits of time blocking? It can help you to battle procrastination, create more realistic time estimates, and devote your full attention to each task and work more thoroughly.\n\nWe all have different rhythms and responsibilities. Personalization is the key to successful time blocking - and it will require some trial and error. Here's how to get started.\n\nEvaluating your current schedule can be surprisingly difficult, because few of us can accurately estimate how much time a task requires. If it feels easier, track how you actually spend your time for a full week. Note each activity - even 10 minutes of email and 15 minutes of social media scrolling between meetings.\n\nAfter you've documented a full week, group tasks into categories, like administrative, meetings, creative work, email, or personal time. You can also label tasks based on how you feel while doing them, or how they influence your energy levels on a scale from 1-10. Do whatever makes sense for you.\n\nExperiment with different scheduling patterns. For example, you could set aside Tuesdays for coding or keep mornings free for business development. You might want to divide the day into two blocks or split your week into three different blocks. It all depends on the nature of your work and what you need to accomplish.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to avoid switching mental gears throughout the day, week, and maybe even the month. I realize this isn't easy - especially for entrepreneurs - but it can be incredibly valuable.\n\nSpending a full day on projects you dislike, such as administrative work or meetings, might feel daunting, but blocking them into a single day can make the rest of your week infinitely more productive, and more enjoyable. You're free to tackle all the entrepreneurial challenges that get your blood flowing.\n\nMost founders crave freedom. Yet, school, jobs, and social norms condition us to work with a traditional, reactive mindset. Before we know it, we've re-created a working schedule that traces back to the 19th century - even in our own companies. Block scheduling is not only a tool to maximize productivity; it's a way to reclaim your time.\n\nIn my 14 years at JotForm, I've realized that business growth means doing more of what makes the biggest impact. I don't always succeed, but I try to focus my time and energy where it matters - and I know that busyness is not synonymous with productivity.\n\nIf you feel the same way, give time blocking a try. Share your experiments in scheduling with colleagues and family members so they understand the changes and can support you.\n\nFinally, don't worry about getting it right immediately. You may need to get under the hood of your calendar and tinker around a bit. Find what works for you, then protect your new schedule at all costs.","592":"How to Clean a Refrigerator (and Keep It Clean) Your refrigerator may be the most important appliance in the kitchen.

Most importantly, it works with footage from any camera.\n\nIn the video above, you will see some solid tips on making skin color look pleasing regardless of the person's skin color. Caleb Pike from DSLR Video Shooter dives into the details of using the vectorscope tool. This is a color management tool that can be found in almost any professional video editing software, as well as in several photo applications (such as Affinity Photo). I can't praise that tool enough, because it changed the way my videos were color-graded once I found about it. It not only works on any skin color, but even if your monitor is not calibrated. Yes, it is important to calibrate your monitor, but the vectorscope gives you an on-screen indicator that doesn't depend on the color shift of your display. You can have great skin (100% guaranteed only for video, sorry) even if your monitor is black and white. Pike shows how he color corrects his footage using Final Cut Pro, but you can easily find a way to apply that knowledge in other professional video software you may be using.","594":"How to Deal with Negative Thoughts (The Healthy Way) Career Resilience Coach passionate about supporting others to grow and thrive in a complex world. Read full profile\n\nWhen I think back to all the unhappy and frustrating times in my life, I realize now that I prolonged these experiences because I spend too much time in my head. I was either worrying about the future or thinking about past mistakes, missed opportunities and all the other events in my life where I felt dissatisfied and frustrated. I didn't even realize how much impact negative thinking had on my life,\n\nThen one day, I read an article that said that we have between 40,000-80,000 thoughts every day. I realized then that the thousands of negative thoughts I was having on a daily basis were preventing me from not only enjoying life experiences, but draining my energy and distracting me from focusing on what was important in my life. It had to stop and the only person who could do this was me.\n\nIn this article, you will understand why you have negative thoughts and how to deal with them.\n\nThe first thing I decided to do was to find the why -- what triggers set off my negative thinking? If I could find the answer as to why I was constantly having so many negative thoughts, then I would be one step closer to better managing the impact that negative thinking was having on my life.\n\nNegative thinking has many different causes and these causes can differ for everyone. The most excessive cause of negative thinking can be as a result of mental health conditions such as Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) or Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Depression is also a factor that contributes to negative thinking and at times in my life, I had the symptoms of depression. While negative thinking can be a sign of mental illness, it can also be a regular part of life.\n\nEveryone has negative thoughts and that is a normal part of our lives. The danger for us, however, is when we keep having these negative thoughts going over and over in our minds.\n\nScientists call this \"rumination\". A habit of rumination can be dangerous to our mental health, as it can prolong or intensify depression as well as impair our ability to think and process emotions.\n\nCortisol is a hormone, which is mainly released at times of stress and has many important functions in our body. Having the right cortisol balance is essential for human health and you can have problems if your adrenal gland releases too much or too little cortisol.\n\nOur brain loves Cortisol as it is there to warn us about the imminent danger and that can be very helpful. The problem is that when we are constantly putting our bodies and our minds in situations of high stress and negative thinking, the cortisol starts to overload. Our brain starts to develop patterns of negative thinking and we start to normalise our thought patterns.\n\nWe train our brains to think we are no longer in imminent danger - this is our new normal but our cortisol levels become dangerously high. The body over time will start to show signs of wear and tear - heart attacks, depression, anxiety, mental illness and the list goes on.\n\nIf you don't keep your negative thinking under control, you will eventually have to deal with serious health issues.\n\nMartin Seligman an American psychologist, educator, and author of self-help books is a strong promoter within the scientific community of his theories of positive psychology and of well-being. He says that the three leading causes of negative thoughts for most people are:\n\nNo matter what causes your negative thoughts, you can manage them with some strategies. Start dealing with your negative thinking as soon as you recognize that negative thinking is about to become a big problem in your life.\n\nI don't believe you can stop your negative thinking once and for all. That is an impossible task to achieve.\n\nA more realistic and achievable approach and one more sustainable is to learn strategies on how to manage your negative thinking so that you have control over how you want to live your life - not handing control over to your negative thoughts.\n\nThis strategy to apply takes time and practice - you will not have control of your thoughts overnight. So be prepared and committed to practising this strategy on a daily basis.\n\nThis strategy is all about teaching yourself how to counter negate your negative thoughts. There are 5 questions you can ask yourself either in your head or as I prefer writing my answers down in my journal:\n\nVisualization is a useful strategy to help you distract yourself from your negative thoughts. Try to picture yourself doing an activity that you love to do - for example shopping, reading books, listening to music etc. The key is to train your brain to think about something completely different for at least 30 seconds.\n\nBe disciplined in trying this technique. Over time, you will have trained your brain to go in a different direction every time your negative thoughts come up.\n\nI love this strategy the most. Essentially, what you are doing here is throwing your negative thoughts away.\n\nClearing your head of negative thoughts by writing them down and letting them go in a physical way releases you from a lot of negative energy. Some people write down their negative thoughts on a piece of paper, screw the paper up and throw in the rubbish bin.\n\nI like to write my negative thoughts fears and regrets on an inflated balloon and then release them into the sky. At the same time, you are saying (yelling out loud) goodbye to your fears, regrets and negative thoughts!\n\n\"Surround yourself with really good people. I think that's an important thing. Because the people you surround yourself are a reflection of you.\" -- Aaron Rodgers\n\nThis quote from Aaron Rodgers illustrates why it is important to have great people in your life. The people that you spend your time with have a huge influence on how you live your life.\n\nIf you want to better manage your negative thoughts, then spend time with a friend who has positive energy, a positive outlook on life and is willing to listen to you share your thoughts and feelings - though they won't let you get away with dwelling on the negative for too long!\n\n\"Positive thinking evokes, more Energy, more Initiative and more Happiness\" - Unknown\n\nOur mind has this amazing ability to convince us of something that isn't really true. These untrue and inaccurate thoughts reinforce our negative thinking.\n\nThe next time you are thinking that you are to blame for everything that is going wrong - stop it. What you are doing is assuming and personalizing your thoughts and reinforcing this with negative thinking.\n\nTake a few minutes out to acknowledge the great things you do, write these down and say these wonderful things out loud to you. Another strategy you could do is to challenge these thoughts with the questions outlined in Step 1.\n\nYou can also take a look at these tips on How to Practice Positive Thinking And Change Your Life.\n\n\"The key to happiness - or that even more desired thing, calmness - lies not in always thinking happy thoughts. No. That is impossible. No mind on earth with any kind of intelligence could spend a lifetime enjoying only happy thoughts. The key is in accepting your thoughts, all of them, even the bad ones. Accept thoughts, but don't become them.\" -- Matt Haig, Reasons to Stay Alive\n\nNegative thinking does not lead you to live a happy and successful life. With dedicated practice and commitment, you can replace negative thinking patterns with thoughts that actually help. This can make a huge difference in your day-to-day happiness. There is no doubt that the more positive thoughts you have the more positive results you will achieve in life.","595":"How to Get Skylum Luminar 3 for Free | Fstoppers If you're looking to try out Skylum Luminar, or just want to own your editing software outright, check out this promotion!

Instead, you can snag a set of extension tubes for a little more than $30, bringing macro reproduction to your existing glass. Obviously, there are some disadvantages (corner sharpness being one of them) but as a home project to keep you from vegetating in front of the T.V., it's very little money for a lot of fun (and perhaps some frustration).\n\nThere's a wide variety of extension tubes available for every brand and sensor size, though some do seem to be (dramatically) more expensive than others. However, if image quality isn't your prime concern, there's entertainment to be had photographing flowers, feathers, and whatever else takes your fancy.\n\nOnce you've got your images, it's probably a good time to learn how to focus stack.\n\nDo you use extension tubes?

Read full profile\n\nWe all know the feeling -- when you sense that you are not completely happy and fulfilled with your life -- things are not where and how you envisage them to be. You go through the motions everyday, angry with yourself and the universe for throwing you such an unfavorable dice.\n\nYou can't help yourself but feel a perennial envy towards those who are smiled upon by karma -- the lucky individuals who seem to have the Midas touch and everything they undertake ends up with success, recognition and greater opportunities. Life must be so exiting.\n\nUnlike yours.\n\nWe call this sensation many names: I've hit a wall; I'm not making progress; I'm stagnant; I'm moving in loops; Something is off in my life; I'm off balance.\n\nOr simply: feeling stuck.\n\nIn this article, we'll look into the reasons behind this feeling and how to get unstuck in life and live a more fulfilling life.\n\nIs it really so bad to be stuck in the status quo? After all, not everyone can be a super-star, right? What's wrong with living a quiet life, with not many turns and twists and just going with the flow?\n\nTrue -- there is not much fun in this, but there is not disappointment, anxiety, stress and ill-ambition either. Life is easy and uncomplicated.\n\nSo why do we keep hearing over and over from the greats that staying is one place is not a good thing?\n\nTony Robbins gives us an elegantly simple answer to this question:\n\n\"If you are not growing, you are dying. \"\n\n\"Progress equals happiness,\" he says. \"That 's because reaching a goal is satisfying but only temporarily. Life is not about achieving the goals, life is about who you become in pursuit of those goals.\"\n\nThere you have it -- staying in one place makes us unhappy.\n\nWe all know that the comfort zone can be great. It's like a warm old blanket you wrap yourself around on a cold winter night, cuddled in front of your favorite TV show.\n\nBut just because something feels comfortable, does it mean it's ok to stick to it forever?\n\nProgress equals happiness, remember.\n\nYou may not even fully be aware of the small voice in the back of your mind that's been bugging you, but you better learn to listen carefully -- because you may wake up one day and realize that your productive life is gone and you haven't achieved many of the things you wanted for yourself.\n\nPretty gloomy picture, indeed.\n\nSimply put, what the wise men advise us of is not just some self-help fluff for them to gain more popularity or sell more books. It is true -- as you will learn below -- that not moving forward, not even making the effort to do better or become better -- even if you don't always succeed in these endeavors -- is a mental demise and a waste of your potential.\n\nThere are many reasons why you may feel stagnant in your life -- some may be completely out of your control even. The main thing, though, is to be able to identify the reasons and then try to take some remedial actions.\n\nBut it starts with an awareness -- because you can't fix what you don't know about, right?\n\nHere are some of the main contributors to your feelings of stuck-ness:\n\nSimon Sinek, the best-selling author and motivational speaker tells us in his famous TED talk that every successful endeavor -- be it related to an organization, your career or personal life needs to begin with defining the \"Why.\" You need to be able to explain to yourself why you do what you do and what drives you.\n\nIt is the thing (s) that gives meaning and inspires you to wake up in the morning and to want to take on the world. It is your reason for being.\n\nYou may like your comfort zone. After all, it's...well, comfortable. But as we established, the good old blanket is not necessarily going to make us fulfilled in life. You can watch so many TV shows wrapped in it before you get bored.\n\nWe, humans, still carry our ancestors' fighting instincts -- for hunting, for self-preservation, for taking actions to make our lives better. Inaction is not what made the mankind create all the innovations we enjoy today.\n\nAdmittedly, it's not an emotion to be taken lightly -- it can be quite real and powerful for many of us.\n\nAccording to a Gallup poll done a while ago among U.S. teenagers, the fear of being a failure and not succeeding in life was at number four. More specifically, this feeling was described as \"making mistakes that will mess up my life,\" \"not measuring up,\" \"not leaving a mark.\"\n\nSo, fear can be a powerful paralyzer and can elicit a \"safe-mode\" response -- i.e. stuck-ness.\n\nWe all know the famous adage that we are the average of the five people we rub shoulders with. So, if your in-crowd is similarly stuck as you are, although it may be consoling at times, you won't be motivated to make much progress yourself.\n\nIt's called a social proof bias -- if everyone around you is doing (or not doing) something, then it is ok for you to follow suit.\n\nWhile comparisons are not always bad, according to the Social Comparison Theory, they have to be handled with caution.\n\nFaring against others can make you very unhappy with yourself. Failing to recognize that your path is not the same as others' and that there are many ways to get to an end-point (goal) can be very discouraging to taking the first step to unstuck-ness.\n\nOur temperaments can also contribute to a sense of feeling stuck. For instance, you may be more of a passive, dreamy kind of person who prefers observing to taking action, pensiveness to gregariousness, solitude to venturing out in the world.\n\nThat is, you have more of a slow-burn personality vs. a fiery one -- therefore, it takes you longer to contemplate all alternatives before taking the plunge.\n\nAnd that's ok. But you need to recognize that this may also be the reason why you are not progressing as fast or as much as you would like towards your goals.\n\nAnd while changing who you are is hard (impossible even, according to some psychologists), there are things that can be done to make it so much better for yourself, which I will discuss a bit later.\n\nA final point to note here is that, paradoxically, it is possible to feel both stuck and unstuck at the same time. For instance, you can have a great career, but your family life may feel a bit stale, or wise versa.\n\nAs our personal and professional lives constantly fight for the top spot on our attention list, the feeling of stuck-ness may also depend on where you are on your life's trajectory.\n\nFor someone who is younger and single, stagnation may be felt more vividly in their professional lives, as opposed to someone who is in their mid-life, where family takes priority -- such individuals may not feel as down-hearted that they are not progressing quickly enough professionally.\n\nThe neat thing about your path to becoming unstuck is that it follows the so-called Principle of Equifinality, which states that the end state can be reached by many means.\n\nIt's not just one thing that can help you to start moving forward again. There are many avenues you can explore to find out what works for you and with your own story and personality.\n\nWoody Allen has famously said that \"80% of success is showing up.\" That is, you need to begin with the right motivation and willingness to take action towards unstucking.\n\nYou must want to improve your current state. And you must follow through.\n\nSpend some time alone. You need to figure out why you are stuck -- that is, what is the root of your discontent. Meditation may help here too. But this step is essential:\n\nPacking on some self-knowledge and awareness on why you are where you are in life can help you discover a whole new universe of ideas on how to make it better for yourself.\n\nIt is as the saying goes: Identifying the problem is half of the solution.\n\nStart to do self-reflection with the help of this article: The Power of Self-Reflection: Ten Questions You Should Ask Yourself\n\nThere is an avalanche of research on the benefits of exercising for the body and the mind. The latest research tells us that if you want to put your mind in the best possible focus shape, a 15-minute jog will do the job better than 15 minutes of relaxation and meditation. It also clears your thinking, improves your attention spans, and can generally make you feel like a \"brand new person.\"\n\nAs I already touched-upon, the \"Why\" behind your actions is a prime driver of self-progress. If you link your goals -- be them personal or professionals -- to a \"bigger-than-me\" aspiration, then it will be so much easier to convince yourself to keep moving.\n\nAccording to recent research, we all have a specific purpose-seeking style -- similar to our own way of writing, dancing or speaking.\n\nThere are four types or \"Whys\" -- creative, prosocial, financial and personal recognition. The prosocial approach to finding meaning, though, which is based on kindness and compassion towards ourselves and others, is the best one in the long-run -- it was shown to lead to greater caring, integrity and personal growth.\n\nHere's How to Find Purpose in Life and Make Yourself a Better Person.\n\nIt's barely a secret that if you enjoy something, you will want to do more of it and it won't feel like an obligation. You will have an internal motivation to keep going despite setbacks, despite the stress or the tiredness you may experience at times.\n\nSo, find what thrills you and makes you come alive and strive to become better, the best even, at it. The more progress you make, the more confidence you will have that you can apply the same passion and dedication to all other parts of your life that feel stagnant.\n\nLearn How to Find Your Passion and Live a Fulfilling Life.\n\nThe Nudge Theory has been around for a while and has shown some wonderful results in positively influencing people's behaviors -- from making us conserve more energy, to improving the payment rates of fines, to making job-seekers more engaged and involved.\n\nSmall things as daily reminders in terms of micro-goals you can set on your phone, for instance, can have a profound favorable effect on becoming unstuck.\n\nNudging can also help overcome some of these personality traits we talked about -- like passiveness or acute proneness to procrastination.\n\nEven if you are in a happy relationship, you may still feel stuck -- i.e. you may be unfulfilled, uninspired, or bored even of doing identical things over and over. The same rings true for your professional life.\n\nThe end-point is that you need to feed your brain different experiences if you want to get unstuck. If you repeat more of the same thing, you will end up with more or less similar outcomes. Change requires taking the path less trodden, experimenting, learning new ways, seeing new places, reading, travelling -- it's an endless list, really, to personal growth.\n\nAccording to research covered in Psychology Today,\n\n\"Activities that lead us to feel uncertainty, discomfort, and even a dash of guilt are associated with some of the most memorable and enjoyable experiences of people's lives. Happy people, it seems, engage in a wide range of counterintuitive habits that seem, well, downright unhappy.\"\n\nAssessing the things that make you feel stagnant is important. But equally valuable is to recognize that just because it may be hard or even impossible to get something that you really want, it doesn't mean that you've failed or that you are necessarily stuck.\n\nMaybe it's simply not your thing. For instance, you may want to become a professional golfer. You practice and practice but you can't quite reach the level of Tiger Woods that you aspire to. Perhaps it's time to take stock of your life and shift your focus.\n\nComparisons can often make you feel down and create a sense of stagnation, which may not always be valid. You must realize that your pace of progress differs from your friends', neighbours', siblings or even significant others'.\n\nJust because you are not a millionaire by the age of 30, or haven't started your own business, or written your third bestseller yet, doesn't mean that you are not moving forward.\n\nSo, mind how you measure your progress and your state of stuck-ness. Your perceptions may differ from reality.\n\nBesides, it's never ever too late to start things over! Here's how:\n\nHow to Start Over and Reboot Your Life When It Seems Too Late\n\nFinally, remember that you don't have to do it all alone. If you feel stuck in your personal life, you can speak to your close ones and find a solution together. Maybe they feel the same way.\n\nAt work -- raise your hand, speak to your manager, volunteer to do things that can help you learn and become more valuable.\n\nYou don't have to come up with all the answers right now. The most important thing, going back to the first idea, is to be willing to make a change.\n\nSeeking progress is a great thing. Who wouldn't want to become a better version of themselves after all?\n\nBut the pursuit of growth should be handled with caution. It can become very addictive and sometimes even be counterproductive.\n\nIt's true -- you may experience a \"runner's high\" and success can make you overflow with dopamine, but the constant chase of \"more\" can toss you into a never-ending spinning wheel.\n\nYou will never be happy with the status quo and won't accept things as they are -- which, naturally, can open a Pandora box of mental health issues.\n\nThat is, too much of a self-improvement drive may leave you unable to enjoy your life, to be fully present in the Now and to appreciate the person that you are.\n\nAnd this is not necessarily a good thing.\n\nSo, should you strive to improve yourself, so that feel unstuck and free again? Absolutely.\n\nBut remember to take a breather and be grateful for what you have.\n\nThe feeling of being satisfied or unsatisfied with one's life is very personal. Similar to its cousins -- happiness and success, it is best measured by and depends on our individual histories, personalities and paths -- i.e. my trajectory is different than yours and what makes me feel content may not create the same feeling for you.\n\nFor instance, you may be happy to be in a position where you help others and their gratitude is sufficient enough reason for you to wake up in the morning. But for someone else, this situation may create a sense of stuck-ness.\n\nThe main take-away here is that you shouldn't compare your story to anyone else's because you may end up feeling constantly stuck. And this, speaking from experience, is not the best place in the world to be.\n\nProgress is great, but don't forget that your life is here and now.\n\nSo, try to enjoy yourself some too, while making your grandiose plans to take on the world, will you please?","599":"How to Remove Gel Nail Polish Without Destroying Your Nails For those who weren't able to make it back to the salon before quarantining, getting your gel manicure off at home can be a headache piled onto a slew of other new problems. Let us help you with this small one.\n\nRemoving a gel manicure's long-lasting lacquer can leave you with weak, peeling, brittle nails. The issue isn't necessarily the polish so much as it is the method of removal, explains Dana Stern, MD, a dermatologist and an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at The Mount Sinai School of Medicine. You're going to need to soak your nails in acetone and then use tools to physically push the polish off your nails -- a harsh and potentially damaging process.\n\n\"When there is aggressive scraping with a metal or wooden tool to remove gel polish, the nail plate also gets removed and this results in significant thinning,\" says Dr. Stern. If you damage the nail matrix, the area of the nail beneath the cuticle, you'll have white patches, ridges, and other surface irregularities to contend with as your nails grow, she warns. Follow these tips and to be your own at-home manicurist. And don't worry about spilling nail polish on the carpet -- we've got you covered there too.\n\nPatience and time are essential to the process. According to Allure, you should allow yourself a minimum of 30 minutes to remove gel nail polish properly. You're going to be doing plenty of waiting, so be prepared to sit and relax. If you're tempted to rush, you'll increase the odds you'll do damage to your nails by scraping the polish off rather than waiting for the acetone to soak it off.\n\nThe shorter your nails, the easier it will be to remove gel nail polish, says Evelyn Lim, chief educator for Paintbox nail studio in New York City. \"Body heat helps with the removal process,\" Lim explains. \"Gel is hard to remove from the free edge (nail growth that goes past the fingertips) as there is no body heat behind it.\" Trim as much of the white part of your nails as possible so you don't have to struggle with removing polish from the most stubborn areas.\n\nYou need to file away the topcoat to break the \"seal,\" Lim explains. She suggests using a 100\/180 grit file and wearing down the shiny layer with the 180 side of the file. If you have multiple layers of top coat or nail art, you may need to use the 100 grit side to break down that thicker polish. This step is key in how to remove gel polish, says Lim, and will allow the acetone to penetrate the lacquer.\n\n\"One of the most common causes of nail damage is cuticle compromise,\" Dr. Stern says. \"When moisture enters the nail unit, the new nail is going to grow with abnormalities,\" she explains. You can help protect your cuticles during the gel polish removal process by coating the area surrounding the nails with cuticle oil. Refinery29.com suggests forming a protective seal around the delicate cuticle skin with an occlusive balm like petroleum jelly.\n\nTo effectively remove gel polish, you'll need to soak in 100 percent acetone. \"Non-acetone nail polish remover simply isn't strong enough to remove gel,\" says Jin Soon Choi, a celebrity manicurist and founder of JINsoon Nail Lacquer. \"If you try to use non-acetone remover, you will have to use so much force that you will damage your nails and it won't cleanly remove the polish anyway.\" Here are 12 other out-of-the-box things you can use that saved nail polish remover for.\n\nDouse cotton balls in 100 percent acetone and place one on each nail. According to Allure, the cotton balls hold more remover than pads and better fit the nail shape to make removing gel polish go faster. Then wrap each finger in a three-inch square of foil. This will hold the acetone-soaked cotton on the nail and keep the solution from evaporating, Soon explains.\n\nThis is the most important step in how to remove gel nail polish and requires the most patience. You will need to soak for a minimum of 10 minutes to loosen the layers of polish. To help speed up the process, Soon suggests taking a hot towel and wrapping it around your hand -- the warmth helps the acetone work while softening the polish to make it easier to remove. While you're waiting, consider polishing your nails Queen Elizabeth II's favorite color next time.\n\nYou'll know you've soaked long enough when you see the edges of the polish curling up. \"When the gel is obviously breaking down or sliding off, gently use a rubber-ended cuticle pusher to clean the polish off your nail plate,\" advises Dr. Stern. This is the critical point in how to remove gel nail polish. Aggressive pushing and rubbing here will damage the nail bed. If you have to use more than gentle pressure, you'll need to repeat the soaking step. When you're ready to give yourself a fresh coat, here's what your nail polish color says about you.\n\n\"Major moisturizing is needed after gel polish removal,\" Soon says. She suggests soaking your fingers in warm lotion containing vitamin E oil or using a hand mask to rehydrate your skin. You should follow with cuticle oil as often as possible to rehab the delicate area. Wait at least an hour before using your hands for heavy chores to avoid stressing fragile nails, Lim suggests.\n\nSoon advises removing your gel polish after two weeks. If you have two gel manicures in a row, Soon suggests taking a two-week break to give your nails time to rehydrate and repair. After that, here are 14 easy nail art designs anyone can handle.","600":"How to Shoot Street Photography in Quiet Areas | Fstoppers I'm sure we've all read enough about how the world has been changing in recent months. But unless you're in Antarctica, you're probably wanting to get away from the crowded areas for a while.\n\nThis can be tough for street photographers: most of us love the crowds and the chaos. But thankfully, there is an entirely fascinating side to street photography that can be done in the quietest of areas.\n\nFor most, this is not what first comes to mind for street photography, but it can be just as interesting and often more so than busy city street photography. It's different from the norm, and it challenges you to find new, fascinating things. People can still be a part of it. And I promise you, with enough practice, you will come back with the same amount of keepers.\n\nHere are a few tips that I find it's important to know for this type of photography.\n\nIt's Tough\n\nStreet photography in quiet areas is tough, particularly at first. In busier areas, people with cameras can still blend in and get close. There's a ton of energy, and new people pop out at you in a consistent stream.\n\nIn quieter areas, you stand out like a sore thumb with a camera. There's just not enough going on to allow you to blend in easily. And you have to figure out how to work around that.\n\nOver time, you will figure out ways to still be candid in these situations if you act the right way. It takes a bit of acting, just making it look like you're photographing the area, pushing yourself to get closer, and acting like you don't think you're doing anything wrong. The more obvious (while being respectful) you are, the more you can get away with, even in quieter areas.\n\nSmaller cameras with prime lenses help a lot for not standing out in quieter areas. They allow you to shoot more quickly, and they don't look as professional.\n\nThis being said, bigger cameras have a different advantage in less populated places, and I love shooting in medium format here. You will obviously be more noticeable, but sometimes, that's a good thing. If you can carry yourself in the right way, the camera looks legitimate, and you look like you have a reason for being there. The fact that you are being so obvious and comfortable about what you are doing will signal to other people that it's okay to not be worried about you.\n\nCreate Portraits\n\nWhile traditional street photography typically stands for candid moments in public, portraits can have a big part in street photography projects, particularly in quieter areas. If you can't get comfortable (and even if you can) taking candid shots of strangers in these areas, you can still do a fantastic project mixing photographs of the surroundings with portraits. This is a great way to tell the story of the area.\n\nWhen you create portraits, it is still important to try to make the portrait feel real and even a little candid. When I ask someone for a portrait, if they already look comfortable, then I sometimes tell them to stay exactly as they are. Other times, I'll tell them to put themselves in a pose that feels comfortable to them.\n\nThe goal is to make them aware that they should look comfortable and like themselves. No need to smile for the camera. You want them to look real.\n\nStudy the Work of Other Photographers\n\nMany photographers have done wonderful projects in quieter areas, and I think it's important to learn about the history of what has been done before and to see the wide variety of styles and content that these photographers have captured in quiet places.\n\nThis will open your eyes to the variety of things that can be done, and you will find yourself noticing many more moments while walking around because of this education. And go beyond just looking at the best hits of photographers on their websites by purchasing their books, which will give you much more of an education on what they were trying to show and say.\n\nThis is where you can see the progression of a story or an idea, and it is where you see not only the most amazing photographs, but the subtle ones and the glue images that hold a project together.\n\nFor examples, check out the work of Todd Hido, Alec Soth, William Eggleston, and Stephen Shore.\n\nLearn a Place and Visit It Over and Over Again\n\nWe covered how it can be difficult to shoot in these areas, particularly at first, but the key to overcoming that is going back to the same area over and over again.\n\nPick a place that you know well (or want to learn to know well), and make going there a part of your weekly routine. Even shooting in short spurts consistently will take you a very far way. The act of returning over and over will give you a nuanced understanding of the place and how it ticks, and it will give you many more opportunities to come across a variety of great moments.\n\nOver time, you will start to notice more and more things that you completely missed early on. Sometimes, you won't believe that you had missed a scene for so long.\n\nCapture the Environment\n\nBesides portraits and candid shots of people, what else is there to capture in street photography (and street photography in quiet areas)? The answer is a whole lot.\n\nStreet photography is about capturing something that lives just underneath the surface, and you can do this just as easily with photographs of the surroundings as you can with people. Capture houses, found objects, the streets, and the infrastructure of an area; it can be anything. The goal is to try to show a story of what the area feels like. What's interesting about it?\n\nTry not to take the area for granted. There are things that you might think of as being normal and everyday that are actually fascinating when you highlight them. Stop yourself, and try to figure out what you are missing.\n\nConnect Yourself With the Place\n\nStreet photography is often about connecting yourself with your subjects. It's about taking something inner and searching for moments in the real world that mirror these feelings.\n\nThink about what it is that drew you to explore and photograph an area. Think about why you connect with it, and then, search for moments that show this.\n\nThis is where the intimacy, nuance, and feeling will start to shine through in your work. And then, when viewers look at your work, they'll not only get an understanding of the area, they'll start to feel like they know something about the photographer behind the work as well.","601":"How to Take Stunning Pet Portraits at Home | Fstoppers Take simple pet portraits at home while you're self-isolating. All you need is a pet, a window, and some pet treats to grab their attention, then set your camera to aperture priority mode and work on your composition.\n\nLook for the Light\n\nMy cat, Aurora, is sitting in front of the lamp here so I've deliberately underexposed the shot to capture a silhouette of her round, chubby face\n\nThe most important step to making a good pet portrait is the lighting. Photographing your pet with a bright lamp in the background may be a nice idea, but think about how this will affect your subject. Either you underexpose to reduce your pet to a silhouette, or overexpose to capture detail in the subject but lose background interest. Position Your Pet Next to the Window\n\nThe north-facing window, camera-left, is cascading soft light across Aurora, giving texture and dimensionality to her soft fur.\n\nInstead, it might be beneficial to encourage your little friend to sit next to a window. North-facing windows are ideal in the northern hemisphere because they produce soft, wrapping light all day long. Of course, other windows will work if it's cloudy out. Position yourself and your pet so that the light pours from one side of the frame and across your subject's face\/body. This way the light and shadow produce dimensionality to the subject.\n\nBonus tip: Having a hard time getting your pet to stay in one place? It might be a good idea to grab some treats and pop them down where you need your pet to be. Or use a toy if you want their eye contact.\n\nShoot in Aperture Priority Mode\n\nShooting in aperture priority mode means you can focus on choosing the depth of field while the camera adjusts shutter speed as light levels change.\n\nThe easiest way to shoot pet portraits at home is to let the camera do some of the work for you. For example, in aperture priority mode you can decide how much depth of field you want by dialing in the aperture, and the camera will decide on the shutter speed appropriate to record good exposure. For my main image I shot at f\/1.4.\n\nIt'll be relatively dark inside, so depending on your light levels you might want to switch on Auto-ISO or ramp it up to ISO 800 or more. That'll ensure the shutter speed doesn't drag, causing camera blur. Auto-ISO also has the added benefit of automatically adjusting exposure so you can concentrate on composition and focusing, while the camera produces a good exposure. If you want to under or overexpose a shot in aperture priority mode then use exposure compensation on your camera.\n\nAuto-ISO adds another layer of automatic exposure to the shot, so you can concentrate on composition and focus. This is especially helpful when pets move between bright and dark spots or light levels change.\n\nFocus on the Eyes\n\nLastly, it's important to get the focus right. Focus on the eyes with your autofocus, or use face detection if your camera has this feature. You may want to use manual focus, but if your pet's particularly fidgety this might be more difficult. Either way, you want to get good focus on the eyes -- or if they're side-on to the camera, focus on the closest eye.\n\nSummary Shoot in aperture priority mode (Av mode on Canon) Position your pet next to the window for beautiful side light Use Auto-ISO or a high ISO to overcome camera shake blur Focus on the eyes, or the nearest eye to you Under or overexpose your shots intentionally with exposure compensation\n\nWe'd love to see your pet portraits so share your favorite images in the comments below with your best tip on how you got the shot. Or perhaps if you've tried the techniques above yourself, why not show us your results below to get some feedback?","602":"How to fix Kaspersky Password Manager error It is a common sight to see all sorts of error messages in Kaspersky.

Key work items with compliance and audit implications have been neglected, and there's insufficient sense of urgency. How can I get this on track, recognizing that I'm not the person in charge?\n\nFirst, my COVID-19 PSA: Practice social distancing! It might feel hard, you might not want to miss out on things, you might have a robust immune system, but don't take a chance on spreading it to others. Thank you.\n\nNow, back to today's topic.\n\nSituations like this occur when there's a leadership vacuum. While those of you with specialized roles such as legal or finance shouldn't take on overall project leadership, it's your responsibility to actively push for appropriate action.\n\nThis can take a number of forms.\n\nIf you are in a genuine emergency, with missed deadlines and key client priorities being missed, be clear, direct and forceful. This is a time to actively model an action orientation targeted to your own responsibility area but with clear implications that others need to follow suit.\n\nFor example, you might say, \"In order to meet this requirement, I need ...\" Then assign tasks: who, what, when. Make the timelines doable but aggressive. Be rigorous about follow-up. Then ask what others need from the team.\n\nIf the situation is less dire but you can see it coming, you've got more slack to get structures in place.\n\nIn that case, be actively involved in assessing needed steps and designing a good structure to support ongoing success. Remember to hold the line on not taking on ownership of tasks outside your domain.\n\nSuccess will depend on your colleagues' ability -- and willingness -- to step up.\n\nApproach the situation assuming good intent. Most people are trying to do their best, and even if they fall consistently short, it's generally not due to ill intent.\n\nThis still leaves the problem of impact. But if you can diagnose the reasons for their failures, you'll reach a faster solution.\n\nSome possibilities include:\n\nBut what if they just don't seem to care? That gets to the \"willingness\" issue. If they are resistant to change or are not interested in learning new skills, then you need to advocate for the well-being of the project.\n\nBasically, you need to demand a culture of accountability.\n\nThis will include a willingness to own tasks, step up to get things taken care of, offer constructive and respectful disagreement, and engage in open discussion when people are falling short. Coddling helps no one.\n\nAfter all, it's in everyone's interest to have the team succeed.","604":"How to fix the gap between school and work in South Africa The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations\n\nThe world of work is changing constantly, profoundly, and faster. This is clear from the outsourcing of work, waves of technological advances, increasing automation in business, and big data analysis driving the growth of industries.\n\nThe needs of industry are shifting constantly and the education system should be responding to provide needs-based support.\n\nEducation theorists, researchers, practitioners, and policy makers have to remember that the occupational situation differs from country to country. They also need to remember that changing work contexts are influencing employees and job-seekers in distinct ways. Work is becoming increasingly more complex. This means that there's a growing need for lifelong learning, teamwork, and networking as well as an increased emphasis on digital skills to promote career adaptability and employability.\n\nThey also have to bear in mind that the industrial sector is shrinking. Accordingly, work-seekers in the Global South have been turning to the service sector as well as to the informal economy with a fair amount of success. This trend is likely to continue.\n\nThe issue is whether education systems are keeping pace with the changes.\n\nGateway subjects\n\nTo understand whether young South Africans have the skills required by the current world of work after 12 years in school I use the lens of the so-called gateway subjects. These are maths and physical sciences and, to an extent, accounting. These form the foundation for scientific, economic, and industrial development and research.\n\nMultiple educationists and researchers have contended that learners who've passed maths and physical sciences and have acquired the basic aspects of information communication skills and robotics have a competitive advantage in the occupational world over those that have not. South Africa simply cannot afford the unacceptably low percentage of school learners who pass Grade 12 with mathematics and physical sciences.\n\nRead more: Why South Africa's declining maths performance is a worry\n\nWhy the emphasis on maths and physical sciences?\n\nHaving passed Grade 12 with maths and physical sciences helps because these subjects contribute at least 22% to the economy. Likewise, having passed either information communication technology or even computer-assisted technology helps to advance the economy by reducing production costs, boosting the growth of new businesses, and improving communication.\n\nIt also helps to acquire \"soft skills\" such as career adaptability, emotional-social intelligence, career resilience, creativity, innovation, and the ability to collaborate and to network, among other things. These skills are increasingly being seen as \"hard skills\" in the 21st century workplace because they're strongly aligned with market needs.\n\nUnfortunately, they aren't being taught and learned adequately at school.\n\nSouth Africa's overly academic school system\n\nA number of problems afflict South Africa's education system.\n\nBlack learners continue to feel the effects of apartheid's education system which spent more on education for white learners. This means that the vast majority of black learners in the neediest environments get inadequate teaching and learning.\n\nUnless the disparity between rich children and poor children is addressed, the gap between the achievements of learners in well-resourced schools and disadvantaged learners in resource-scarce schools will persist.\n\nThe effects of this disparity are felt for the rest of the pupils' lives. One consequence is that they they struggle to succeed in university studies.\n\nAn added difficulty is that the country's overly academic school system sends the message to learners and their parents that learners should strive to study at a university and that it is 'better' to study at a university than, for instance, at a TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training) College.\n\nI'm in favour of introducing a system that facilitates differentiated training from an early stage.\n\nAt the end of grade nine - at about 15 years old - most learners are already able decide whether they want to pursue academic or more vocational studies. This is the point where the system should start channelling them in career-related directions that will give them their best chance of eventually pursuing careers that \"fit\" their personalities - including their interests and aptitudes and enable them to enact their central life themes.\n\nAnother key factor that needs to be addressed is the matter of inadequate career counselling for pupils - black learners especially. During apartheid, the disadvantaged black majority of students were denied access to career counselling in schools. Even today, the vast majority of black learners still receive little career counselling at school and cannot afford to pay a career counsellor.\n\nFunding should be made available by the government and employers to enable learners to consult career counsellors. Group-based career counselling is a viable solution to the challenge of providing career counselling in schools with large numbers of pupils.\n\nSolutions\n\nI maintain that there are solutions for these challenges. What's needed is the will to use resources that are available and to move forward expeditiously.\n\nTo help narrow the disparity gap I've argued in favour of making it compulsory for graduating teachers and educational psychologists to do community service in rural areas and townships. These professionals must be given incentives, their safety must be ensured, and they must be paid a decent salary.\n\nAnother step that could be taken is to rehire the many teachers who have been retrenched or who have taken severance package deals.","605":"How to get free cookies in downtown Minneapolis today Forgot to mark the occasion?

In cases where people have more mild symptoms, how do they know when they're no longer contagious?\n\nDr. Joshua Septimus, an internist at Houston Methodist, says there are several ways to determine when you are no longer at risk of spreading the virus.\n\n\"When someone is still in the hospital, and we're asking the question of whether or not they've recovered, it's easier,\" he said. \"We retest them, and you have to have two tests, a minimum of 24-hours apart, before you can say that someone is no longer infected.\"\n\nIf you're not in the hospital, the answer is more difficult.

It's time to start the feeding and maintenance process. There are a few tips and tricks to help you maintain a long and healthy relationship with your starter.\n\nThere are many schools of thought regarding how and what to feed your starter. The truth is that there's no wrong answer, and it's purely a matter of preference. Starter is fed with a ratio of the original ferment to water and flour.\n\nI maintain what's considered a thick starter. It's a forgiving and sturdy ferment (her name is Rose) that has a medium-to-strong sourness. The ratio for mine is 1:2:3, which translates to one part starter, two parts water and three parts flour, by volume. I use room-temperature starter, just slightly warm filtered (tap) water and unbleached, all-purpose flour.\n\nFor a typical feeding, I mix 100 grams of starter, 200 grams of water and 300 grams of flour. I let the ferment sit at room temperature for 4 to 6 hours (or until it's tripled in volume) before I put it to work. If I'm not going to bake until the next day or after that, I let her sit out for 3 to 4 hours and then refrigerate. When I'm ready to rock, I bring her out and let her come to room temperature again (about an hour) before baking.\n\nAnother popular ratio is 1:1:1, which means if you start with 100 grams of starter, you add 100 grams of water and 100 grams of flour. This creates a ferment that's thinner (more like pancake batter), but it's also quite versatile and easy to convert to other types of flour if you want.\n\nIf your starter is healthy, you should notice that it's bubbly and fragrant and should double\/triple in volume after a few hours.\n\nRead more: The best meal kit delivery services of 2020: Home Chef, Blue Apron, HelloFresh and more\n\nAs I mentioned, I use unbleached all-purpose flour, but you can use whatever you prefer. Whole-wheat, barley, einkorn, spelt, rye, even rice flour all work well and create distinct flavor profiles that will transfer into your bread or other baked goods.\n\nAvoid buckwheat because it's actually not a grain, but rather a seed that's related to rhubarb. There are methods to making a gluten-free buckwheat starter that involve a more complicated fermentation process, but adding it raw won't work for your starter.\n\nHaving trouble finding flour in stores (in-person and online) right now? It might be worth reaching out to a local bakery.\n\nRye flour is a (not so) secret weapon for sourdough bakers! If your starter is taking a long time to double, it may be lacking some of the microbial strength it needs to do its job in your baking. I regularly substitute about 10% of my AP flour when feeding for rye flour. I think it supercharges my starter and adds a sweet and nutty flavor.\n\nThe general rule is not to let your starter go longer than two weeks without being fed, but we all know that it happens.\n\nIf you come across a starter that you've ignored for a bit too long, you may not be out of luck. Check the starter carefully: If there is any mold or fuzz growing on it, throw it out. If it's been sitting unfed for a while, you probably will see some grayish liquid on the top. This is called the \"hooch,\" a naturally occurring alcohol that's part of the sourdough fermentation process. Pour it off and discard that liquid. Feed the desired quantity of the remaining starter, and feed it more often than usual over the next few days (every 6 to 12 hours) to revive your old friend. Keep in mind that the volume will triple each time, so you don't have to start with a large quantity of ferment.\n\nFor example, if you use a 1:1:1 ratio for your feeding, and you feed 20 grams of starter, you'll have 60 grams after the first feeding, 180 after the second, 360 after the third and so forth. So don't despair if you're starting with a small quantity. With a few feeds, your starter will be back in action: bubbly, happy and ready for your next baking adventure.\n\nThere are near infinite variations on sourdough bread, but your sourdough starter is also good for lots of other baking projects!

But Evgeny Kuznetsov broke the Caps' drought in the final second of the second period, sparking the team to a remarkable four-goal comeback.\n\nThe Caps would eventually win in a shootout, kicking off a six-game winning streak.\n\nVegas Golden Knights at Washington Capitals\n\nDate: Wednesday, April 8\n\nTime: 8 p.m.\n\nOriginal Game: November 9, 2019\n\nThe game that capped off the Caps' aforementioned six-game winning streak - and extended their point streak to 11 - was an easier win. The Caps pulled ahead early and never looked back, keyed by Backstrom's two-goal day.\n\nOf course, games against the Golden Knights will always have a special place in fans' hearts after the summer of 2018.\n\nSan Jose Sharks at Washington Capitals\n\nDate: Thursday, April 9\n\nTime: 8 p.m.\n\nOriginal Game: January 5, 2020\n\nThis was as wild a finish as the Caps have had in a long time. Down 3-2, they pulled Braden Holtby late in the third period, and the Sharks took advantage with an empty-netter. Then, miraculously, the Capitals scored twice in the final 47 seconds of the game to force overtime, where they won the game.\n\nThe Caps would have considered themselves lucky just to come away with a point here, and instead, they got two in one of the most memorable finishes in franchise history.\n\nHow to watch the 2018 Stanley Cup Final, Washington Capitals vs. Las Vegas Golden Knights\n\nAll-day Sunday, April 12\n\nGame 1\n\nTime:\n\n9 a.m.\n\nLocation: Las Vegas\n\nOriginal Game: May 28, 2018\n\nThe first team in the nation's capital to make even a semifinal run in 20 years, the hype surrounding the Capitals in the Stanley Cup Final was immeasurable. The Golden Knights hosted Game 1 with a breathtaking opening ceremony, and the two teams jumped on each other early with a 2-2 first period.\n\nWashington took the lead 4-3 early in the third period, but Braden Holtby struggled during the frame and the Caps fell 6-4 to fall behind in the series, as they had throughout the postseason run.\n\nGame 2\n\nTime:\n\n11:30 a.m.\n\nLocation: Las Vegas\n\nOriginal Game: May 30, 2018\n\nThe Caps fell behind early in the game, but bounced back to steal a close Game 2. Alex Ovechkin scored his first goal of the series, Braden Holtby was superb - including an all-time legendary save - and the Capitals headed home tied 1-1 in the series.\n\nGame 3\n\nTime:\n\n2 p.m.\n\nLocation: Washington\n\nOriginal Game: June 2, 2018\n\nThe first home championship game Washington hosted in years, Game 3 was as hot a ticket as you'll ever find.\n\nHoltby was terrific once again, allowing his only goal in the third period. Evgeny Kuznetsov recorded a goal and an assist, and to nobody's surprise, it was Ovechkin who scored the Caps' first home goal of the series.\n\nGame 4\n\nTime:\n\n4:30 p.m.\n\nLocation: Washington\n\nOriginal Game: June 4, 2018\n\nGame 4 was the Caps' biggest explosion. They scored six goals in the game, including three on the power play. Six different players netted goals for the Capitals in a well-rounded effort, boosted by Backstrom's three assists.\n\nAfter their easiest win of the series, the Caps were riding high up 3-1 heading back to Las Vegas.\n\nGame 5\n\nTime:\n\n7 p.m.\n\nLocation: Las Vegas\n\nOriginal Game: June 7, 2018\n\nThe one that needs no introduction, right? After a scoreless first period, the teams exploded for five combined goals in the second period, including a power play goal from Ovi.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrailing 3-2 entering the third period, the Caps needed someone else to step up, and they got it.

While the expression of Hox genes continues through postnatal and adult stages, whether Hox genes continue to function in the skeleton after the establishment of skeletal morphology has not been determined due to lack of genetic tools. To address this issue, we generated a conditional Hoxd11 allele that allows for temporal deletion of Hox11 function at adult stages following normal zeugopod development and growth of the skeleton. Here, we show that Hox genes function in the adult skeleton by regulating the differentiation of skeletal stem cells into the osteolineage.\n\nHox genes are indispensable for the proper patterning of the skeletal morphology of the axial and appendicular skeleton during embryonic development. Recently, it has been demonstrated that Hox expression continues from embryonic stages through postnatal and adult stages exclusively in a skeletal stem cell population. However, whether Hox genes continue to function after development has not been rigorously investigated. We generated a Hoxd11 conditional allele and induced genetic deletion at adult stages to show that Hox11 genes play critical roles in skeletal homeostasis of the forelimb zeugopod (radius and ulna). Conditional loss of Hox11 function at adult stages leads to replacement of normal lamellar bone with an abnormal woven bone-like matrix of highly disorganized collagen fibers. Examining the lineage from the Hox-expressing mutant cells demonstrates no loss of stem cell population. Differentiation in the osteoblast lineage initiates with Runx2 expression, which is observed similarly in mutants and controls. With loss of Hox11 function, however, osteoblasts fail to mature, with no progression to osteopontin or osteocalcin expression. Osteocyte-like cells become embedded within the abnormal bony matrix, but they completely lack dendrites, as well as the characteristic lacuno-canalicular network, and do not express SOST. Together, our studies show that Hox11 genes continuously function in the adult skeleton in a region-specific manner by regulating differentiation of Hox-expressing skeletal stem cells into the osteolineage.","611":"Hughes turns down chance to earn $500,000 bonus DETROIT -- The Twins offered Phil Hughes a chance to retire one more batter this season and earn a $500,000 bonus. But \"it just didn't feel right,\" he decided.\n\nA sudden eighth-inning rainstorm on Wednesday cost Hughes a chance to pitch the ninth inning, and his season ended after pitching 209 2\/3 innings -- or one out short of his half-million-dollar bonus for 210 innings. So on Thursday, after consulting with owner Jim Pohlad and team president Dave St. Peter, general manager Terry Ryan and manager Ron Gardenhire offered to let their righthanded ace pitch to a batter or two this weekend out of the bullpen, to get one final out. Major League Baseball's collective bargaining agreement doesn't allow teams to award incentive bonuses for getting \"close enough.\"\n\n\"We called him in today -- this organization feels we should do that, that he's earned every bit of it,\" Gardenhire said. \"He thought about it and said, 'I just don't feel it.' He said, 'I feel like my arm's had enough, I don't want to risk an injury.' \"\n\nThat's because Hughes, who earned $8 million this season, plus $250,000 bonuses for surpassing 180 and 195 innings, has two more years left on his $24 million contract.\n\n\"Ownership and [Ryan] extended the offer to let me throw out of the bullpen, and I just didn't feel it was right,\" said Hughes, who had never pitched more than 191 innings before. \"I'm surprised they extended that offer to me; that was very generous. It says a lot about this organization. But I own my 100 percent health to this organization over the next two years, and I'm not going to do anything to risk that. ... For whatever reason, it's just not meant to be.\"\n\nRyan said he was impressed by the decision. \"He decided after a little thought, he just wasn't going to do it. So I respect that,\" Ryan said. \"It is a decision that would be difficult to make if you're a player.\"\n\nIf you're superstitious, though, maybe there's reason to be wary. Hughes would have had one more start this season, but a rainout on Sept. 12 pushed the rotation back by a day and cost him his chance to pitch in the season finale on Sunday. He would have pitched the ninth inning on Wednesday, but for a small rain cell that interrupted the game just long enough to make the Twins unwilling to let him continue. \"That rain was situated right around downtown Minneapolis,\" marveled Ryan. \"It wasn't hardly raining anywhere else.\"\n\nThe prospect of pitching without his normal rest and out of his normal routine, with an arm tired from a long season, just to get one out was just too much risk, Hughes decided. \"I feel good,\" he said, \"and that's part of the reason I don't want to push the envelope as well.\" He also could have jeopardized the major-league record he set this season: the 11.625 strikeout-to-walk ratio, highest in history. One walk would have lost the record.\n\nHughes said the decision was his alone, \"and it wasn't a tough call.\" His agent Nez Balelo -- who would have collected a 4 percent commission, or $20,000 -- agreed with his choice, and Hughes said he doesn't believe the MLB Players Association will mind him passing up the cash, either. \"It's my call, my career and my health,\" he said. \"And it's not worth it to me.\"\n\nHe was surprised by the attention his contract got, and said he felt gratified that fans rallied to his cause, insisting on Twitter that he be paid the bonus. \"That was very kind of them to appreciate what I've done this year,\" Hughes said. \"You don't really expect people to want professional athletes to get paid more money.\"\n\n---\n\nMeanwhile, though Hughes won't be part of it, the Twins and Tigers play a rather important game tonight. Important to the Tigers, anyway, who can clinch at least a tie for the AL Central crown with a victory and a Royals loss in Chicago. It's reigning Cy Young winner Max Scherzer against Twins rookie Trevor May. Eduardo Escobar moves to third base to replace Trevor Plouffe. Here are tonight's lineups for the 6:05 p.m. start:","612":"Human Rights Watch calls for independent investigation into Freeport shooting Human Rights Watch (HRW) has called for an independent investigation into the recent murder of a New Zealander Freeport employee by members of an armed group in Mimika regency, Papua\n\nGraeme Thomas Wall, an employee of gold and copper mining company PT Freeport Indonesia, was shot dead by gunmen in Timika last week.\n\nTwo of Wall's colleagues, Jibril Wahar and Yosephine, were admitted to Tembagapura Hospital with serious injuries, while four other people sustained minor injuries and were treated in the office.\n\nHRW researcher Andreas Harsono said that while Indonesian police should investigate the attack and bring the perpetrators to account, he was worried about a potential violation of the rights of ordinary Papuans.\n\n\"The New Zealand police should offer to send a team to help the Indonesian investigators. A criminal investigation in a place such as Timika, with numerous competing political and business interests, is best carried out by an independent investigative team removed from local issues,\" Andreas said.\n\nAs well as investigating this latest killing swiftly, Andreas said that the Indonesian government should also allow independent journalists, including from New Zealand's media, to enter Papua without the region's highly restrictive travel permit, so that they can freely investigate and report on this crime, he added.\n\nAlthough the Papua Police initially focused their investigation on an armed gang commanded by a person named Joni Botak, separatist group the West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB) has claimed responsibility for the shooting.\n\nPapua has been the hotbed of separatism for years and armed groups, which authorities say operate in several regencies in the province, are reported to have been behind numerous violent incidents in the region.\n\nEarlier this month, the police said some 790 people fled their homes in mountainous areas around the Freeport mining site to take refuge at the Tembagapura Police headquarters in Timika over fears of an armed criminal group, which had reportedly terrorized the villagers.\n\nSecurity authorities previously reported that armed groups had been shooting at Indonesian Military (TNI) and police guard posts. The residents' access to basic needs, such as food and health care, had reportedly been restricted by armed men who blocked roads.\n\nAuthorities also claimed the locals were still traumatized from their previous encounter with the armed group in November 2017, when its members blocked access into and out of several villages.","613":"Humans incorporate trial-to-trial working memory uncertainty into rewarded decisions Edited by Jacqueline Gottlieb, Columbia University, New York, NY, and accepted by Editorial Board Member Thomas D. Albright February 24, 2020 (received for review October 24, 2019)\n\nInformation stored in working memory (WM) is incorporated into many daily decisions and actions, and many complex decisions involve WM; however, there has been little work on investigating what WM information is used in memory decisions. Here we try to draw connections between WM and decision making by manipulating prior beliefs in a standard WM task with rewards. We use this paradigm to show that WM contains a representation of the trial-by-trial uncertainty of visual stimuli. This uncertainty is incorporated into rewarded decisions along with other information, such as expectations about the environment. By studying WM in parallel with decision making, we can gain new insight into how these systems work together.","614":"Hunting for bears and happiness amid the epidemic Fewer people are found on Canberra's streets as COVID-19 spreads, but a new population has become increasingly visible in the city\uff0dteddy bears.\n\nThe \"bear-hunt\" campaign has come to the Australian capital to create unexpected social-distancing experiences for people, especially children, while the pandemic disrupts their lives.\n\nDifferent colors and shapes of the stuffed toys have been placed in windows, on trees or in gardens.\n\n\"The bear-hunt experience has provided great excitement to my two little girls, 5 and 2 years old,\" says 32-year-old Rachael McCoy.\n\n\"It encourages them to get active and go walking around our streets.\"\n\nShe learned about the campaign from Facebook.\n\nThe hunt was inspired by British author Michael Rosen's book, We're Going on a Bear Hunt, the BBC reports.\n\n\"Yesterday, we went out, and we saw about 10 houses (with the teddies),\" says McCoy.\n\n\"They were gorgeous displays.

In reality, the acne started in my early teens, like it does for so many others. In high school it feels normal to have acne -- who doesn't? But my fight against acne always seemed harder than my friends, due to the fact that I'm allergic to most antibiotics dermatologists prescribe for skin issues. So I relied solely on topical treatments with benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid; some would work for a little while, but then my acne would come right back again.\n\nBy the time I got to college I started taking birth control to tame my breakouts, and it worked like a miracle for about two years -- up until the day I ended up in the emergency room with chest pains. I was too scared to pop another pill after that. So I went back to topicals -- my dermatologist prescribed Retin-A Micro and my pesky skin problems were solved once again.\n\nBut just a few months shy of my 30th birthday, my acne came back with a vengeance -- in the form of deep, painful cystic bumps. This new form of acne was unlike anything I had encountered in the past, and I didn't have a clue about how to fight it. I started making more frequent dermatologist visits, getting monthly extractions and cortisone injections when necessary, but it wasn't letting up.\n\nI also started working with a celebrity aesthetician, Renee Rouleau, who happens to be famous for her her anti-cyst treatment. Articles have been written praising its effectiveness -- but it didn't work for me. Rouleau explained that it doesn't work for everyone, because each case of acne is unique. I altered my diet and stayed away from dairy. I tried so many different lotions, potions, and gadgets, but the acne didn't budge. The cysts were popping up so ferociously, I practically moved in with my dermatologist.\n\nIf you've ever suffered from acne -- you know what it feels like to be at wit's end. I was convinced that I would never have clear skin again, and while I like to think that I have a heathy dose of self-esteem, it was starting to take a serious toll. My selfie days were over. To make matters worse, my dark skin means I'm also prone to hyper-pigmentation (see some pictures below). Any sign of inflammation on my face leaves a dark mark which can take months to fade away -- even with a prescription of Hydroquinone.\n\nMy dermatologist then prescribed me Spironolactone, a cardiovascular drug, she said could help with hormonal flare-ups. Following a quick blood test, I began taking it twice a day, but shortly after I started experiencing chest pains. I immediately stopped taking it, disappointed once again. The doctor made it seem like Acctuane was my last resort but I did not want to go down that road (the potential side effects were just too much for me to handle). Out of options, I turned to Google, as one does. I spent hours scrolling through Amazon reviews and message boards -- and that's where I first came across the acronym DIM. A commenter on Into The Gloss had raved about a cure-all acne pill -- DIM -- and how it was an all-natural way to clear hormonal skin. Other reviews on retailer's sites and natural health blogs mirrored the sentiment of the first. I didn't need to read any more. This was it, the ticket to finally curing my skin.\n\nFor those who've never heard of it before (I certainly hadn't) -- DIM stands for diinodolymlethane. It's a food-based compound found in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower and brussel sprouts that supports hormonal balance. It's basically like getting a super dose of greens every day that can clear up your hormonal acne, and can even lessen PMS symptoms. It's also been touted as a wonder-solution for menopausal women. Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center even recognizes its ability to have both anti-inflammatory and anticancer effects.\n\nAfter taking it for just two weeks I noticed a change. I was breaking out way less. About a month later, it seemed like my acne had come to a complete halt. As active cysts were fading away, no new ones were popping up the replace them. Trust me, I could barely believe it. After suffering though painful, stubborn zits, countless cortisone injections at my dermatologist's office (my last visit before starting DIM I got six injections!) -- the miracle I was looking for was waiting for me on Amazon.com for $18. SHOP\n\nI've been on the pill -- DIM, that is -- for six months, and I can happily report my skin is still healed, save for a few scars still lingering on my cheeks and jawline. I've had little to no side effects, and both my gynecologist and dermatologist gave it their stamp of approval to keep taking it (always check with your doctor before swallowing a new supplement). Oddly enough, when I first mentioned it to them, neither had heard of it before. And neither had so many other women I shared my skin concerns with. So I'm here to shout it from the digital rooftops: DIM has been my saving grace. After all these years, my skin is finally, beautifully clear.\n\nUpdate August 2019\n\nNot a week goes by that I don't received emails or Instagram DMs from readers who either have DIM success stories to share or want to know if I'm still taking the supplement and if it's still working for me. So I thought I'd share an official update with everyone.\n\nI'm pretty bad at taking pills consistently so once I had achieved my desired results in 2017 I took a break from the supplements. My acne stayed at bay for a while, except for a few white heads here and there which I could handle. However, things definitely worsened this year and my cystic acne once again felt a bit out of control. I would start taking the DIM once a day for a week or so, but then fall off the wagon.\n\nFor the last month I've committed to taking it every single evening and the jury is still out on whether the supplement still works. My first trial with DIM had me seeing results within two weeks, however a month in and I'm still getting deep painful cysts, but maybe not at the same rate as before. I'm going to stay on it for another month and see if things work themselves out, but I'm definitely starting to believe that DIM is not a long-term fix. However, I'd still recommend it to anyone looking for relief.\n\nUpdate April 2020\n\nI continue to receive so many messages from people who've found this story who have had great success with DIM or want to know whether I'm still taking it. I did give it a few more months and did not see any improvement with the supplement. In November 2019, I switched dermatologists and started seeing Dr. Bhanusali who I had worked with in the past on laser treatments for my hyperpigmentation. He created two different topical compounds -- retinoid for nighttime, and mixture used to treat rosacea for daytime and I saw major improvements right away. My skin still isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement from where I started. I still highly recommend trying DIM for those who are looking for some acne relief.","616":"I Didn't Speak to My Brother for 6 Years -- Here's What Finally Brought Us Back Together I was told that our mother's death would either bring us closer together or tear us apart -- it turns out, it did both.\n\nGrowing up, my brother and I had the typical older-sister, younger-brother relationship. He loved to annoy me and I always wanted to boss him around. I am five years older so we didn't really share friends or activities but for the most part we always got along well. That all changed in January 2013 when my mom died of an unexpected heart attack. (Here's why sibling relationships matter.)\n\nGrief does strange things to people. My brother and I dealt with her death in very different ways. He and my mom were very close so he was devastated by her death. He was just 18 years old at the time and channeled his feelings into finishing his senior year of high school: prom, graduation, choosing a college, etc.\n\nI, on the other hand, turned to drugs. I'd been prescribed Percocet, an opioid painkiller, for years to help with my chronic kidney disease and I'd never abused it. But that changed in an instant: The night my mother died was the night opiates took over my life. I remember swallowing a handful of painkillers and then calling a local drug dealer to meet me in the parking lot of the hospital to bring me more pills. I remember thinking to myself, \"There's no way I can be a mother to my son, support for my dad, and help my brother without being emotionally numb.\" I thought I was doing everyone a favor by self-medicating and ignoring my feelings. The truth is, I was doing everyone a disservice -- including myself. Instead of supporting them, I quickly became emotionally inept and unavailable. Sound familiar? Check out these 10 signs you might be addicted to pain pills.\n\nThe tension between my brother and I started a couple of years before my mother's death. My mother and I had a tumultuous relationship. I had my son in my early 20s and didn't deal with being a single mom well, drinking more and using any excuse to leave my son with her. My brother saw me taking advantage of our mom and he resented all the chaos my irresponsibility caused in our family. He also saw me go through several bad relationships, which made him very protective of me yet also very angry with the fact that I continued to settle for far less than I deserved. His feelings of powerlessness increased his fear and resentment of me. Our mother's death was the breaking point. (A family death is just one of the reasons why adult siblings stop speaking to each other.)\n\nNot long after my mom died my father took a promotion with his job and moved across the country, my brother went away to college, and I found myself alone with my son. The only way I can describe that time is \"insane.\" My addiction progressed and I became even more erratic and irresponsible. My relationships with everyone I loved declined as I became more and more explosive. I began to isolate myself more and more every day.\n\nI even risked losing my son to my addiction when child protective services (CPS) became concerned enough about my ability to be a good parent that they opened an investigation. To keep my son I had to pass regular drug screenings. One of the most insane moments happened when I somehow thought I could take drugs right outside of the CPS office and still pass a hair follicle drug test. It wasn't until I landed in jail and was faced with the prospect of losing my son that I was willing to accept that maybe I had a problem. I'll never forget the fear on my brother's face when he came to the precinct because the police were trying to get him to talk sense into me. We hadn't talked in months but he was still willing to help me. In my defiance, I refused to cooperate, demanded a lawyer, and began to succumb to opiate withdrawal in jail. This was one of the lowest points of my life and certainly the lowest point in our relationship. I remember that he physically had to hold me back and I could feel the anger and fear resonating from his skin to mine. I could see the hopelessness in his eyes. It wasn't long after that day that he just stopped talking to me. Seeing him walk away from me, physically and emotionally, was one of the worst feelings I've ever experienced.\n\nMy brother was baffled by my decisions. He truly believed that addiction was a moral failing and didn't realize addiction is a mental illness. Completely out of patience with me, he wasn't there when I walked out of jail two days later. I felt abandoned and absolutely broken but the insanity continued as I still didn't see how my problems had anything to do with my drug or alcohol abuse. I was convinced I was a victim of circumstance and bad luck. But then the women from CPS came and offered me a second chance; I like to call them my real-life angels! They told me if I got treatment for my addictions then they would close the case and I could keep my son. It was the reality check I needed and I made a commitment to get sober for him. I moved to Florida and started treatment.\n\nFor the next five years, while I did the hard work necessary to get clean, I didn't hear much from my brother. He was occupied living his life and, angry and tired of my chaos, had cut off contact with me. I don't blame him one bit.\n\nWhen I got sober I wanted to make amends with my brother but he wasn't ready. Then, in 2018, our cousin died and, overcome with grief over losing another family member, my brother finally decided to answer my calls. I told him how truly sorry I was for what I'd put him through. I apologized for all the times that my addiction was the topic of conversation over a family dinner that was supposed to be celebrating his achievements, for all the times I wasn't there when he needed me, and for all the times I disappointed him.\n\nAt first he was reluctant to believe I was serious or even truthfully sober. But as he saw the work I put into my recovery and the woman and mother I've become, he began to let go of his anger. He learned that addiction is not a matter of willpower but instead a mental illness that knows no prejudice. Little by little, through many difficult conversations, we repaired our fractured relationship.\n\nNow, we talk at least once every single day, Facetiming each other with jokes and typical sibling rivalry. We also have heartfelt talks, where we share our feelings and ask for advice. Recently, he told me he's proud of me and I've changed how he views the disease of addiction. Hearing my baby brother say those words to me was one of the best moments of my recovery.\n\nThis past January I went to visit my brother in Atlanta, to celebrate my birthday and the anniversary of our mom's death. We spent a whole week together, just him and I. We didn't do anything special, just spent time together. It felt like home like I'd finally found my family again.\n\nToday, I have a relationship with my brother that, in my darkest moments, I thought I'd never have. Thanks to sobriety and forgiveness, I'm finally able to be the sister I never was to him and he has become one of my best friends. I know our mother would be so proud. I remember someone telling me that my mother's death would either destroy our family or bring us closer together. At first, it ripped our family apart but, from ashes to beauty, I firmly believe her death and all of the bumps along the way have made us closer than ever. I am forever grateful.\n\nTo learn more about Patricia's story follow her on Instagram or at Stodzy Internet Marketing, the recovery-based digital marketing company where she works.","617":"I asked Tanzanians about studying in China: here's what they said The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations\n\nOver the past three decades, China has turned into a major study-abroad hotspot for thousands of African students. In 2018 it hosted over 60,000 African students, making it the second most popular destination for African students abroad, after France. It is even ahead of the US and UK.\n\nThis trend can, in part, be explained by China's growing provision of scholarships and also by the Chinese government's human resource and education capacity building schemes, such as the African talents programme, which target the continent.\n\nDriving this relationship is China's desire for international diplomacy and to improve the international ranking of Chinese universities. Chinese institutions also want to improve the mobility of Chinese students and academics into Africa and have African scholars lecture in China.\n\nOne African country with a long history of education cooperation with China is Tanzania. This dates back to 1962. A major component of this relation is scholarships.\n\nAs part of my research interest in China's role towards technological capacity building in Tanzania, I wanted to know how useful these scholarships were for Tanzanian students. I did a study with 85 Tanzanians who had academic training in China, provided by the Chinese government. I also got inputs from 13 stakeholders, including Chinese and Tanzanian administrators of the scholarship scheme.\n\nI found that, the study group was generally positive about the knowledge and skills they received through classroom sessions and practical and laboratory activities. They also brought back equipment (like multimedia projectors) and technical literature which would benefit them and others back home.\n\nBut there were some challenges too. These included cross-cultural barriers and language related communication problems. Another factor was that Tanzania sometimes didn't have the capacity to use some of the advanced Chinese technologies, such as nano science, taught in the courses.\n\nMore must be done to improve the relevance of training courses for African students in China. For this to happen, Chinese trainers need to become more acquainted with Tanzania's, and more largely Africa's, developmental and technical situation.\n\nThe study\n\nIn 2014, about 1,400 Tanzanians attended various training courses in China, including scholarship recipients funded by the Chinese or Tanzanian government. The figure reached 3,520 in 2016.\n\nMy study focused on the two scholarship schemes that attract the largest number of applicants for short and long education programs in China.\n\nJust over 60% of the study's participants had attended academic training programmes that lasted at least one year. The rest attended short training courses. For those in academia, 45% were pursing a Bachelor's degree, 38% a Master's and 17% were at the PhD level.\n\nI used both interviews and surveys to assess what the students thought about the relevance and quality of the courses.\n\nStudents were generally positive when it came to the quality of the programmes, particularly when they were asked to compare the courses to similar ones they encountered at Tanzanian institutions.\n\nThe greatest gains they found were access to electronic and physical learning resources, specifically literature and equipment which are limited or too expensive in Tanzania. Chinese scholarship awards were also considered to be more prestigious than local accolades.\n\nImprovements needed\n\nThe students and trainees also highlighted some challenges.\n\nFor example, participants of the short seminars described the training using phrases such as; \"more of a tour\", \"serves the demonstration of China's economic achievements\" or \"a series of unrelated lectures\".\n\nSome recipients were suspicious of the Chinese' motives for the training. Many believed the awards were meant to favour Chinese more than Tanzanian interests.\n\nThe language barrier came out as the leading challenge facing the majority of the surveyed trainees. 67% of respondents were trained in English, 19% in Mandarin with English translations and the remaining 14% attended the courses in Mandarin language.\n\nLanguage barriers prevented classroom communication, socio-cultural interactions and also the acquisition of basic services while they stayed in China.\n\nFor those in long term academia, a major challenge they faced was access to English learning resources. Medical trainees had the added challenge of having to interact with patients during clinical sessions.\n\nFor their part, the Tanzanian government's scholarship administrators were happy with their engagement in the awarding process. They did say that more could be done in granting them access to completion records.\n\nMeanwhile, the Chinese officials said that Chinese universities improved their global ranking because of programmes like these.\n\nSocio-cultural differences\n\nOther than communication, there were other socio-cultural differences that the students found challenging. These included the different type of food and racism - particularly for those trained in smaller, less multicultural Chinese cities. These challenges led to students feeling isolated, homesick and lonely - particularly amongst the longer-term candidates.\n\nFinally, while the students were impressed by China's advanced technological capabilities, some found they couldn't use their new skills at home because of technology gaps. For instance, a medicine alumni used a diagnostic kit that he found very efficient during his training in China. However, the government hospital where he works was only able to get them three years after his return.\n\nI propose that collaborative research and exchange programmes be designed between Chinese and Tanzanian academic institutions. This would make them more relevant. And as China continues to invest in businesses in Tanzania, it could ensure graduates have the right training for the jobs being created.","618":"I never did make it to Twins spring training this year and I miss it Columnist Jim Souhan didn't make it to Twins spring training in Florida for the first time since 1992. It's not the perks he missed; it's the job.\n\nBecause of the pandemic, I didn't cover Twins spring training for the first time since 1992. Canceling the flight left me in the same place as so many other Minnesotans -- worrying and working from home.\n\nAs a beat writer covering the Twins for the Star Tribune, I spent almost two months a year in Fort Myers. As a feature writer and columnist, I have spent one or two weeks per year there. Having lived in Minnesota for 30 years, Fort Myers has surpassed most of the other places I've lived -- including Okinawa, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Missouri and Texas -- as a second home.\n\nThe weather? Sure. Leaving Minnesota for Florida in February or March is one of the best perks of a great job. But it's not the primary lure.\n\nThe baseball? Nah. The games are generally unwatchable and meaningless.\n\nRemember, Luke Hughes was a spring training star for the Twins. He finished his big-league career with a .218 regular-season batting average. Few jobs are won in March; most teams pick their Opening Day rosters based on past performance, not spring statistics.\n\nThe beaches? Nope. Most years, I try to have one meal within sight of the ocean, but that's about it.\n\nThe city? Fort Myers tends to be overcrowded during spring training.\n\nNo, what I like most about spring training isn't any one perk; it's the work.\n\nSpring training might be the most pleasant working environment in sports, offering the worst baseball but best conversations of the year.\n\nSpring training is the rare -- perhaps the only -- big-league sporting event during which nothing really matters. It is the rare place in sports where athletes ease toward their goals, where they tinker with their craft without the pressure of producing results. A pitcher can change his slider grip, try it out for a week or two, then change back if it doesn't work. Can you imagine the reaction if Kirk Cousins altered his throwing motion in August?\n\nDuring spring training, baseball players love to talk about how hard they work, but in reality they are being encouraged to not work too hard, to not risk injury, to not burn themselves out. So, for most of them, spring training becomes a place to think and talk the game, to discuss philosophy and strategy, without the gut-tightening pressure of an important result in the offing.\n\nBaseball always has been a sport of oral history, and the stories tend to get better and more numerous every year. In other sports, the locker room is a work and changing area; in baseball, the clubhouse is a social center as well as a work space.\n\nI was talking with Kirby Puckett at his locker early one spring morning when Dave Winfield showed up, pulled up a stool and joined the conversation. Then a rookie first-round draft pick walked in, looking worried. Puckett told him, \"Young buck, I'm going to leave my wallet filled with all this money right here in my locker. You take whatever you need, any time.''\n\nThe youngster was Torii Hunter.\n\nDuring a baseball spring training, front office executives, business-side executives, former players, national writers and the field staff regularly troop through the middle of the clubhouse, and most are happy to talk about the game they love.\n\nSpring training is the rare place and time where just about everyone seems relaxed.\n\nPart of the experience is the odd, transient, diverse, touristy vibe of Florida. It's a place so rife with randomness that writers such as Elmore Leonard and Carl Hiaasen have mined its culture for the comic and criminal intersections of carpetbaggers, grifters, locals, Native Americans, Cubans and snowbirds.\n\nSpend enough time in Fort Myers or any other place like it and you will veer from the establishments trying to attract tourists and find exceptional food in the most generic of strip malls.\n\nWhen I was younger, part of the appeal of spring training was the Florida nightlife. Over the many years of covering the Twins, what became more appealing was day life, watching players work at the craft of baseball under the Florida sun, each certain he will succeed.","619":"I planned carefully so I could keep the cash flowing in the first few months For Ian Wooding-Jones, the collapse of the company where he had worked for more than two decades provided the impetus to start his own business - and he hasn't looked back.\n\nRedbourn Auto Solutions - the car service and repair centre he started in June 2012 to offer main dealer quality and standards but at lower, independent prices - is set to cover its costs over its first year of trading. Sales have shown steady month-on-month growth, and he has expanded his core team from four to seven.\n\n\"I always wanted to run my own business,\" says managing director Wooding-Jones. \"Taking the leap was a big challenge. But when it is forced upon you, you have to make a decision, and for me it has worked out for the best.\"\n\nWooding-Jones was general manager of two Saab dealerships when the carmaker finally lost the long drawn out fight to avoid filing for bankruptcy in December 2011.\n\nHe bought a stock of car parts from the administrators - raising the money he needed from bank loans, family and savings - employed some people from his old dealerships and started selling the parts wholesale from the village of Redbourn in Hertfordshire where he lives.\n\nThe parts were sold for more than was paid for them - which kept cash flowing in during the first few months of the business and enabled him to pay rent and staff. Then he was granted planning permission to convert the premises into a car workshop, where he is busy building a customer base.\n\n\"We are offering the level of service you expect from a main dealer - but because our overheads are lower, we are not charging customers a main dealership price,\" says Wooding-Jones. \"Word is spreading fast.\"\n\nTogether with his wife, Melanie, who looks after the accounts and human resources, Wooding-Jones has been to a \"huge amount\" of networking events to help promote the business.\n\nThe car service and repair centre attracted 500 new customers in its first five months, with 10% making a return visit within that time.\n\nWooding-Jones is now focusing on developing car sales as a new strand to the business and has expanded from four core staff to seven - all hand-picked from the old Saab dealerships so he was able to select people he knew and was happy to work with - and he hopes to replicate his model as the business expands into more villages.\n\n\"We have just got to the point where the bank can see we're going in the right direction, and they've said that if you want to borrow money, we are here for you,\" he says.\n\nAsked for any tips or advice for people wanting to start a new business, Wooding-Jones says the collapse of his previous employer provided him with the push he needed to take the plunge. \"Don't just think about it and let it fester - I wish I'd started earlier.\"\n\nWebsite: www.redbournautosolutions.com","620":"I'm an MLK scholar - and I'll never be able to view King in the same light The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations\n\nDavid Garrow, the Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer of Martin Luther King Jr., has unearthed information that may forever change King's legacy.\n\nIn an 8,000-word article published in the British periodical Standpoint Magazine on May 30, Garrow details the contents of FBI memos he discovered after spending weeks sifting through more than 54,000 documents located on the National Archive's website. Initially sealed by court order until 2027, the documents ended up being made available in recent months through the President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992.\n\nThe most damaging memos describe King witnessing a rape in a hotel room. Instead of stopping it, handwritten notes in the file say he encouraged the attacker to continue.\n\nKing was once thought of as a saint beyond reproach. After his death, it eventually emerged that he was a womanizer.\n\nIf these FBI memos are accurate - and I have good reason to believe they are - we now have to ask the unthinkable: Was King an abuser? And what might this mean for his legacy?\n\nOther outlets balk\n\nThe FBI files contained some other notable information.\n\nGarrow writes that King may have fathered a daughter with Dolores Evans, a girlfriend of his who is still alive and living in Los Angeles. The memos also detail the closeness of his relationship with Dorothy Cotton, a longtime associate of King's in Atlanta and director of his organization's Citizen Education Program. It appears that the two were romantically involved.\n\nMany of these transcripts were based on audiotapes that are still sealed under a court order.\n\nGarrow had taken his findings to other outlets, but each decided against publishing them. The Guardian initially agreed to take the story, edited the piece, paid Garrow for his work and then decided the story was too risky to run. Editors at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution said they didn't want to run the piece because they couldn't listen to the actual recordings the documents were based on. Some historians have questioned Garrow's choice to publish the content of the memos and transcripts without listening to the recordings, and have pointed out that the FBI had spent years trying to undermine King.\n\nHowever, I've gotten to know Garrow and his work over the last 11 years while conducting my own extensive research into King's use of Langston Hughes' poetry. Garrow has the same reputation among historians as Bob Woodward has among journalists - that is to say, I have no reason to doubt Garrow's intentions or the accuracy of his article.\n\nKing's sexual exploits long known\n\nSoon after King's death, several members of his inner circle, including Ralph Abernathy, started publicly discussing King's philandering.\n\nAt the time, many justified his behavior by saying it was no different from the biblical David writing his psalms by day, only to be relieved at night by his concubines. Others pursued a line of defense extended to John F. Kennedy: What someone does in their own time isn't the public's business.\n\nGarrow had outlined several of King's marital infelicities in his 1986 biography of King. But he often spared the names of the women involved to protect their identities. Finally, in 2010, Kentucky State Sen. Georgia Davis Powers recounted her intimate relationship with King in her book \"I Shared the Dream.\"\n\nBut what has just emerged takes things to a whole new level: It now seems that King failed to stop a rape.\n\nMemos detail a rape\n\nDuring FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover's 48-year tenure, the agency greatly expanded the scope of its surveillance activities - often at the behest of sitting presidents. While Harry Truman worried the FBI was becoming a \"citizen spy system,\" presidents like Lyndon B. Johnson eagerly gave Hoover permission to gather information on political enemies.\n\nStarting in late 1963 and continuing until his death, the FBI had been tracking King's every move. FBI surveillance of King began with the goal of uncovering the relationship of King and his closest advisers, like Stanley Levison, with communists. But over time, the FBI started to fixate on King's sexual exploits. In an era of lenient surveillance laws, J. Edgar Hoover was able to gain unmitigated access into King's personal life.\n\nThe memos show that agents knew that King and a group including Baltimore Pastor Logan Kearse were going to be staying at the Willard Hotel in January 1964 days before he ever arrived.\n\nBy bugging the room, they were able to listen in on King and at least 11 others participated in what the FBI memos describe as \"an orgy\" on Jan. 6, 1964.\n\nThe microphones also picked up activities from the night before, when Kearse, who died in 1991, allegedly sexually assaulted one of his parishioners. According to the memos, King was in the room. The handwritten note indicates that King didn't just observe the assault - he laughed.\n\nWorse, instead of trying to stop the incident, the memos say King apparently offered advice to the perpetrator, encouraging the abuse.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nThe information contained in the memos won't be confirmed until 2027. That's when the FBI's full audiotapes, photographs and film footage of King will be unsealed per a 1977 court order.\n\nSome might doubt the FBI's trustworthiness given the agency's historic treatment of black activists. But as someone who has researched similar files, I believe Garrow's experienced approach parses each of these acts with absolute precision. As Garrow explains in his article:\n\n\"Without question [the agents] had both the microphone-transmitted tape-recording and a subsequent full transcript at hand while they were annotating their existing typescript; in 1977 Justice Department investigators would publicly attest to how their own review of both the tapes and the transcripts showed them to be genuine and accurate. Throughout the 1960s, when no precedent for the public release of FBI documents existed or was even anticipated, [the agents] could not have imagined [their] jottings would ever see the light of day.\"\n\nIt's natural to want to defend King - to say, \"let's wait and see.\"\n\nOthers might try to argue that abuse precedes abuse, and that the long legacy of slavery still informed the actions of these revered black clergy who subconsciously became like their oppressors. This legacy, of course, often included white men raping black women and sometimes disowning their children.\n\nBut I don't think any filter of rationalization can soften this portrait of King. I'm not prepared to wait eight years, and I've halted my two scholarly projects about King.\n\nI've also started thinking about what happens next.\n\nWhat will the next Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebrations look like? Will other details emerge? Will more women come forward? Will community centers, schools and streets need to be renamed? Will statues come down, or will they remain - and give fodder to those who justify keeping Confederate monuments?\n\nKing espoused nonviolence. If these memos are true, such a stance feels hypocritical.\n\nThe narrative has just changed. And if scholarship and true biographical research matters at all, one thing is clear: These FBI memos may have forever damaged King's legacy.","621":"I, Pastafari: we all have something to learn from the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations\n\nPastafarianism, also known as the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM), is in the news again with a documentary , I, Pastafari, recently screening in the United States. The religion has long been viewed as a joke. For the first time, this documentary takes the Pastafarians and their message seriously.\n\nFSM's apparent lack of sincerity as a religion (their traditional headdress is a colander, their deity an invisible spaghetti monster) has lead to the idea that they constitute no more than a satire on society. The organisation formed in 2005 following the publication of an open letter by Bobby Henderson, a recent physics graduate. In it he protested the intention of the Kansas State Board of Education to permit teaching intelligent design in public schools, in contrast to evolution. Henderson argued that the Pastafarian position on this debate should also be given equal value and consideration.\n\nPastafarianism has grown in interest and practice since. The church has sought to be recognised in a number of jurisdictions as a religion with the same rights and privileges as existing recognised religions. Along with their peculiar religious dress, they claim specific moral precepts, a deity, their own creation mythology and version of intelligent design to support their claim to be recognised as a religion like any other.\n\nShould we take Pastafarians seriously?\n\nAlthough the Pastafarians seem absurd, their headdress and doctrine highlight the very real contradictions in secular societies. They force an important question: how, in modern times, should we define a religion? They are not alone in challenging the status quo, of course. Vegans and Jedis have sought recently to be treated as religions.\n\nSo, how does the state define a religion? And why is it necessary? This are key questions, because these definitions are what lead the state to grant organised religions special status, such as opening government and parliamentary sessions for certain religions in the UK and US, reduced taxation, such as in the UK, Australia, the US or charitable status, as in the UK.\n\nIn this light, I think that the Pastafarians are worth serious consideration. The common view is that the religion is simply a parody, and a dangerous one, in that it takes attention away from those with protected beliefs, who often have statutory protections. But first the religion or belief must be recognised. And if all beliefs are treated the same, so the argument goes, then the \"serious ones\" won't get the special treatment they deserve.\n\nBut this is their precise point. Why should certain beliefs receive special protection and benefits from the state? Although the Pastafarian doctrine and arguments appear comical, they have serious intent in that they highlight the inconsistency of the way in which states treat religion.\n\nThe church's founder has argued their values include the need to \"keep religion out of government schools, keep money out of religion, that sort of thing\". They clearly state on their website:\n\nFSM is a real, legitimate religion, as much as any other. The fact that many see this is as a satirical religion doesn't change the fact that by any standard one can come up with, our religion is as legitimate as any other. And that is the point.\n\nSpaghetti movement\n\nFSM has had some limited success to date, such as authorised officiating at weddings in New Zealand, opening a government-sponsored prayer session in Alaska, and are most recently under consideration in the European Court of Human Rights. They have had some failures as well, most notably in the US, where a federal court in Nebraska ruled in 2016 that Pastafarianism is not a religion.\n\nBeyond highlighting their right to be given parity as a religion, they also raise issues related to freedom of speech. If Pastafarianism is not allowed to make a case for its status as a religion in the public sphere, then this becomes a warning. If these rights are withheld or limited, such freedoms for unconventional philosophies, especially recent ones, to access rights of freedom of speech and religion are lost.\n\nThe Pastafarians highlight that it is difficult to deny them the same rights and privileges using existing criteria for religious definition. One cannot say they have no deity. They have. They have religious texts. One cannot say they have an illogical or far-fetched dogma. They would not be alone there. They are new? So are the Mormons and Scientologists. They argue, if we are a religion, let us have the same privileges and accommodations. It is not for us to prove we are a religion, it is for you to prove we are not. In assessing their claims we must review what why governments give it special status in many secular countries.\n\nSociety and the state must consider their message, rather than mocking the messenger. Such criticism builds on increasingly disputed and shifting ground. We have something to learn from them about discussions on where religion is sited in modern society, and to review why special status is accorded. This new documentary will give many food for thought.","622":"ICC Includes Two Indian Women Umpires In Its Panel | Cricket News The number of women match officials across different International Cricket Council panels has gone up to 12 as Janani Narayanan and Vrinda Rathi of India were on Wednesday named in the International Panel of ICC Development Umpires. The announcement comes soon after the launch of 100% Cricket, a 12-month campaign anticipated to build on the momentum of the ICC Women's T20 World Cup 2020.\n\nThe campaign, launched just before 86,174 people watched the final of the ICC Women's T20 World Cup 2020 final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on International Women's Day, aims to create more excitement around the women's game ahead of the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup 2021 in New Zealand.\n\nAdrian Griffith, ICC Senior Manager - Umpires and Referees said: \"These are exciting times for women's cricket, and it is only appropriate that we have more women officials at the international level. We will work proactively with Member Boards to give female officials the pathway needed for their growth.\n\n\"I am sure Janani and Vrinda are looking forward to their time on the panel. I wish them all the best and hope they not only perform well on assignment, but continue to develop their skillset with our support as they travel along their journey.\"\n\nNarayanan, 34, who idolises the late David Shepherd of England and retired India umpire Srinivas Venkatraghavan, has been umpiring in Indian domestic tournaments since 2018.\n\nJanani Narayanan said: \"It feels great to know that Vrinda and I have been inducted into the ICC's development panel. This gives me the chance to learn from seniors on the circuit and improve in the years to come. Cricket has become part of my daily routine since the 90s and I look forward to be associated with the sport at a higher level.\n\n\"I take this opportunity to thank the BCCI for the opportunities given and the ICC for giving me this break. I would like to thank Mr Radhakrishnan, who has been my mentor since I first started umpiring.

Australia are the most successful side in the tournament's history, having earlier won the title in 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2018. Harmanpreet Kaur-led India, who entered the final after their semifinal against England was washed out in Sydney, failed to rise to the occasion in the final. They had progressed to the summit clash by the virtue of topping Group A. In the group stage, India had won all four of their matches.\n\nIn the final at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground, hosts Australia won the toss and opted to bat. They rode on Beth Mooney's unbeaten 78 and Alyssa Healy's knock of 75 runs to post a mammoth 184\/4 in 20 overs -- the highest total om a T20 World Cup final, men's and women's.\n\nFor India, Deepti Sharma top-scored with 33 runs as they lost seven of their batters for a single digit score in a tough chase.\n\nMegan Schutt led the bowling attack with four wickets, while Jess Jonassen chipped in with three as Australia bowled out India for 99 in 19.1 overs.\n\nEarlier, Healy showed intent straight away with a boundary off Deepti Sharma's first ball. She smacked two more in an eventful opening over which also saw her dropped by Shafali Verma.\n\nHer opening partner Mooney also had an early let-off, with Rajeshwari Gayakwad putting down a caught and bowled chance when she was on eight.\n\nIndia were nervous and their fielding poor, with the batswomen running quick singles.\n\nAn aggressive Healy was in fine touch and smashed two big sixes in succession off Gayakwad before bringing up her 12th T20 half-century with yet another boundary.\n\nAustralia reached 91 without loss at the halfway mark, with Healy then hitting three successive sixes off Shikha Pandey who was taken for 23 in the over. But her luck finally ran out going for another big hit, caught off Radha Yadav for 75 from just 39 balls.\n\nAt the other end, Mooney quietly went about her business to bring up her ninth T20 half-century before three late wickets fell.\n\nSkipper Meg Lanning was caught for 16, Ashleigh Gardner lasted just three balls and Rachael Haynes made only four.\n\nBut the late fightback wasn't enough to prevent Australia posting the highest score ever in a women's T20 World Cup final.\n\n(With AFP inputs)","624":"IND vs AUS: Harmanpreet Kaur Says \"Need To Play With More Focus In Big Games\" | Cricket News Indian T20I captain Harmanpreet Kaur said that the team is heading in the right direction but they need to work on how they approach big matches. India crashed to an 85-run defeat to Australia in the final of the 2020 Women's T20 World Cup at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday, collapsing to 99 all out in reply to Australia's 184\/4. This was India's first loss in the tournament, having won all four of the group stage matches before this and going through to the final after a washed out semi-final due to that record.\n\nIndia were especially hurt by Alyssa Healy and Beth Mooney's destructive 115 run opening stand. Both players were given reprieves by the fielders in the first four overs.\n\n\"The way we played in the league stages, it was outstanding. It was unfortunate to drop those catches today,\" said Harmanpreet in the post-match presentation ceremony.\n\n\"I still have a lot of faith in my team. The upcoming one and half years is important. The future is important for us. We need to stay calm and focus on the areas we need to improve, especially the fielding. We know we weren't able to win the game because of our fielding. We need to keep these things in mind.\"\n\nHarmanpreet, who turns 31 on Sunday, said that the progress that the team is making is reflected in the fact that India faltered at the semi-final in the last World Cup in 2018 and are now the runners-up.\n\n\"The future is great for us. We need to trust ourselves. I trust this team. The first game was very good, it gave us a lot of confidence. We have to keep working hard. We are in the right line, every year we are improving,\" she said.\n\n\"We just need to think of how we are going to play with more focus in big games, because sometimes, we are not able to give our best in important games. I hope upcoming years will give us a lot of glory,\" she said.\n\nHarmanpreet also said that the players are now looking forward to the Women's T20 Challenge that is expected to be held later in the year and hopefully more Indian players come through the tournament.\n\n\"This year we are hoping for some more games in the Women's T20 Challenge. That tournament is very important for our domestic cricket and we got two players from there. Hopefully, we do get more players so that they can contribute to the team,\" she said.","625":"IND vs SA 1st ODI, IND vs SA Highlights: India vs South Africa Match Abandoned Due To Rain In Dharamsala | Cricket News The first One-Day International of the three-match series between India and South Africa was abandoned due to rain in Dharamsala on Thursday.

Chennaiyin went through to the final 6-5 on aggregate, thanks to their 4-1 victory at home in the first leg.\n\nGoa started well and were dominant through the first half wherein Lucian Goian's (10') own goal and Mourtada Fall's (21') header gave the hosts hopes of a comeback in the tie. However, goals from Lallianzuala Chhangte (52') and Nerijus Valskis (59') after the restart handed the initiative back to Chennaiyin FC. Though Edu Bedia (81') and Fall (83') raised hopes of another comeback, Chennaiyin saw the game out towards the end.\n\nAs expected, the home side came out all-guns-blazing, chasing a three-goal deficit from the first leg. The Gaurs were boosted by the return of Hugo Boumous and Brandon Fernandes from injuries but the first goal of the match came from an unlikely source.\n\nGoa launched one attack after another right from the off and a good cross from the right flank by Jackichand Singh in the 10th minute undid the visitors' defence. Lucian Goian met the cross at the near post and accidentally headed the ball into his own net.\n\nWith the deadlock broken, the hosts took full control of the midfield and Chennaiyin struggled to string more than a few passes together.\n\nGoa's dream start was made even better when Brandon delivered a terrific cross into the centre of the box from the right-hand side. Mourtada Fall timed his leap to perfection and guided his header past Vishal Kaith and made it 2-0.\n\nThe hosts were dominant throughout but were dealt a blow when Boumous picked up an injury midway through the first half. He was replaced by Edu Bedia but the change didn't affect the dynamics of the game.\n\nFC Goa started the second half just as they ended the first. Jackichand was at the end of a glorious chance to net Goa's third goal when Seriton's cross from the right flank was cushioned into the path of the Indian winger by Corominas. The former Kerala Blasters forward scuffed his shot from close range and Kaith let out a huge sigh of relief.\n\nThe miss soon came back to bite the Gaurs as Chennaiyin scored against the run of play. Rafael Crivellaro received the ball on the left, cut in and unleashed a powerful shot towards the goal. Mohammad Nawaz parried the effort straight into the path of Lallianzuala Chhangte who pushed the ball into the net and stunned the home crowd.\n\nThe defence let Goa down again close to the hour mark. Crivellaro sent an inswinging corner into the box and Nerijus Valskis, who was left unmarked, headed in to make it two away goals for Chennaiyin.\n\nGoa nearly turned the game around after the 80th minute. Fall got the ball on the left and his deflected cut-back fell perfectly for Edu Bedia inside the box who slotted into the net.\n\nTwo minutes later, the defence failed to clear a long ball into the box and the keeper failed to punch it clear. Fall was alert to the opportunity and headed the loose ball into the net to set up a tense end to the game.\n\nGoa needed two more goals to secure a win but it turned out to be too much to ask for in the last few minutes.","635":"ISL: David Williams Guides ATK To Final With Win Over Bengaluru FC | Football News ATK staged a thrilling comeback to reach the Indian Super League final after a 3-1 win over defending champions Bengaluru FC in the second leg of their semi-final clash at the Vivekananda Yuba Bharati Krirangan in Kolkata on Sunday.

ATK now face Chennaiyin FC, both two-time ISL champions in the grand finale in Goa on Saturday, March 14. It was Bengaluru who took the lead through Ashique Kuruniyan (5') early in the game but Roy Krishna (30') pulled one back in the first half. David Williams then did the star turn for ATK with a brace in the second half (63', 79') to send his team through to the final against Chennaiyin FC on Saturday.\n\nAshique put the visitors into the lead as early as in the fifth minute as he got on the end of a pass from Nili Perdomo. The winger skipped past the challenge by Sumit Rathi and beat Arindam Bhattacharya at the near post to hand Bengaluru the advantage.\n\nThe winger had another opportunity to double the lead in the 19th minute. Sunil Chhetri found him in space and he cut inside from the right to see his effort go over the bar.\n\nBengaluru custodian Gurpreet Singh Sandhu was called into play when Roy Krishna trapped a ball from Prabir Das and laid it for the onrushing Williams, whose first-time shot was just about kept out by the goalkeeper.\n\nJust at the half-hour mark, the home side pulled one back. Williams found Das in space on the right and his cross towards the near post was slotted into the back of the net by Krishna with a first-time effort.\n\nAfter the break, ATK continued to see more of the ball but struggled to carve open the rigid Bengaluru defence. The visitors were happy to put bodies behind the ball and hit the opposition with quick counter attacks.\n\nIn the 60th minute, Williams was brought down by the trailing leg of Suresh Wangjam and the referee awarded a spot-kick. From the ensuing penalty, Williams sent Gurpreet the wrong way to make it 2-1.\n\nBengaluru did come close to equalizing when Chhetri's free-kick found Dimas at the near post and his attempt to flick it in went a few inches wide.\n\nAntonio Habas threw Mandi Sosa and Jayesh Rane into the mix as the Kolkata side searched for their third goal.\n\nArindam made a crucial save in the 75th minute as Suresh sent an inch-perfect ball for Kevaughn Frater but the Jamaican striker's shot from point-blank range was saved by the ATK custodian.\n\nFour minutes later, Das and Williams combined once again to put ATK ahead on aggregate. Rane sent Das to the byline down the right-wing and his cross was headed in brilliantly by Williams, beating Gurpreet all ends up.\n\nCarles Cuadrat introduced Leon Augustine for Pedromo as they looked to stage comeback. However, the visitors were repelled by a stout ATK defence who booked their berth in the final in Goa.","636":"Ice-sheet scale distribution and morphometry of triangular-shaped hummocks (murtoos): a subglacial landform produced during rapid retreat of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet | Annals of Glaciology | Cambridge Core High-resolution digital elevation models of Finland and Sweden based on LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) reveal subglacial landforms in great detail. We describe the ice-sheet scale distribution and morphometric characteristics of a glacial landform that is distinctive in morphology and occurs commonly in the central parts of the former Scandinavian Ice Sheet, especially up-ice of the Younger Dryas end moraine zone. We refer to these triangular or V-shaped landforms as murtoos (singular, 'murtoo'). Murtoos are typically 30-200 m in length and 30-200 m in width with a relief of commonly <5 m. Murtoos have straight and steep edges, a triangular tip oriented parallel to ice-flow direction, and an asymmetric longitudinal profile with a shorter, but steeper down-ice slope. The spatial distribution of murtoos and their geomorphic relation to other landforms indicate that they formed subglacially during times of climate warming and rapid retreat of the Scandinavian Ice Sheet when large amounts of meltwater were delivered to the bed. Murtoos are formed under warm-based ice and may be associated with a non-channelized subglacial hydraulic system that evacuated large discharges of subglacial water.","637":"Identification of MLKL membrane translocation as a checkpoint in necroptotic cell death using Monobodies This article requires a subscription to view the full text. If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nDysregulation of cell death by necroptosis has been implicated in human inflammatory diseases. Phosphorylation of the MLKL pseudokinase, the terminal effector in the pathway, by RIPK3 is a hallmark of pathway activation, but additional checkpoints downstream in the pathway remain incompletely understood. Here, we generated synthetic protein ligands, monobodies, against MLKL to dissect key checkpoints in the pathway. We identified monobodies that inhibit necroptotic signaling by binding to an indispensable site on the \u03b14 helix of human MLKL's N-terminal four-helix bundle \"killer\" domain, which we propose blocks recruitment of essential adaptor(s).

How truncated, how many games, I can't say at the moment.\"\n\nThe Board's top boss reiterated that safety is their top priority, a day after the IPL was postponed and the three-match ODI series between India and South Africa was also called off.\n\n\"We will monitor further. Safety is most important and with the current situation with what is going around the world and in India, with government directives, we have even postponed the remaining domestic matches.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, Kings XI Punjab's Ness Wadia said he doesn't know when the T20 event will commence.\n\n\"We cannot and no one, you know, is in a position today to say when it's going to start. We will review the situation after two to three weeks. And hopefully by then the cases will reduce,\" Wadia told reporters after the meeting with Ganguly and BCCI secretary Jay Shah.\n\nSix to seven options were discussed during the meeting. In India, there have been two deaths and more than 80 positive COVID-19 cases, resulting in a government directive to shut the fans out of sporting events to avoid large gatherings, which eventually led to a postponement and even cancellation of many sports events.\n\nGanguly said the situation will be assessed every week. \"We met with the owners, to tell them how it can happen and where do we stand at the moment.\n\nAt the moment, it is just postponed. We will assess the situation,\" he said.\n\n\"It will be reassessed every week. I can't say at the moment (about a deadline). I has to be worked around. As much as we want to host the IPL, we also need to be careful about the security.\"\n\nAsked if there is any backup plans, the former India captain said, \"I can't say anything at the moment, allow us a week, let's see how it goes around the world.\"\n\nThe decisions to postpone the cash-rich league and the ODI rubber were taken hours after the Delhi government on Friday suspended all sporting activity in the national capital due to the ever-growing health crisis. Delhi is home to the Delhi Capitals IPL franchise.\n\n\"The second option right now is that teams could be divided into two groups of four and then top four go into the play-offs. The third option is increase of double headers (played on weekdays),\" a source informed.\n\nThe fourth option is holding all matches in just a couple of centres with restricted movements of players, support staff and TV crew.\n\nAnother alternative is to play behind closed doors and have all the 60 games in a shorter time frame which will ensure that the stakeholders do not lose out truckloads of money.\n\nThe source also confirmed that shifting the tournament abroad was not discussed at all in the meeting.\n\nWadia said: \"BCCI, IPL and (official broadcaster) Star (Sports) are clear that we are not looking at financial loss.\"\n\n\"At the meeting everyone agreed that human beings come first and finance comes second. We are here to adhere to governments directives,\" Wadia added.\n\n\"No decision can be taken until there is clarity. Clarity will only be in two-three weeks. As far as your next question is will foreign players come on? I don't know. There is a ban till the April 15 and then we'll see.\"\n\nDelhi Capitals owner Parth Jindal tried to downplay the discussion on options and said that there will be another meeting later to discuss other modalities.\n\nWhen asked whether there will be more double-headers this season, Jindal said, \"We didn't discuss anything, we need to assess the situation and the health and safety of public is most important consideration.\"","639":"If MotoGP season resumes, what will it look like?

One crash, and there goes the championship.\n\nAnd how many races does it take to crown a champion anyway?\n\nMotorcycling governing body the FIM's regulations stipulate 13 - unlucky for some.\n\nDorna boss Carmelo Ezpeleta has conceded the number in 2020 may need to be less.\n\nVermeulen says just one race would suffice if you were the winner but adds more seriously: \"Four or five rounds wouldn't feel like enough to quantify a world champion, maybe seven, eight or nine and you'd start to see a pattern.\"\n\nThe former factory Suzuki rider also has concerns for the financial implications.\n\n\"Motorcycle racing, more so than other motorsport, is funded within the industry itself, the biggest income is manufacturer backing,\" Vermeulen explains.\n\n\"Right now who is buying a motorbike and who is selling any motorbikes? Where is the money coming from for the manufacturers?\n\n\"Then there's the private teams, how does this affect sponsors and the rider market?\n\n\"The majority of private teams and Moto2 and Moto3 teams are sponsored by Italian and Spanish brands.\"\n\nAcknowledging the same concerns, Dorna have now guaranteed the 'economic well-being' of independent teams by issuing 'considerable advance payments' for April, May and June.\n\nWhile the financial considerations could be unnerving for off-contract Aussies Jack Miller and Remy Gardner, Vermeulen says it could work to the younger rider's advantage: \"If the teams don't have much money they could go and get riders out of Moto2, guys that aren't going to cost them much, they could be a lot cheaper than trying to keep some of the big-name MotoGP riders.\"\n\nVermeulen, a self-confessed Scrooge, says riders and engineers should expect to take a pay cut as teams assess how many staff they need to go racing.\n\nHe also says a freeze on development could assist to lower costs including running the 2020 bikes again in 2021.\n\n\"It wouldn't change the spectacle would it?\"\n\nAnd he's right.\n\nFor now though, there are more questions than answers as MotoGP, and the world, aims to get back on track.","640":"If You Do Not Do This As a Creative You Will Not Succeed | Fstoppers How serious are you about making this crazy photography game full time? It is an amazing feeling to get to create every day, but are you forgetting to do the other eighty percent of what is needed to survive?\n\nThe difference between a successful creative and a starving artist is one thing, how much effort you put into marketing. I would even go to say, that marketing is the most important aspect, maybe even more so than the actual art if you want to live off the art. I know many talented creatives who are broke, and I know many poor photographers who are running thriving photography businesses. The only difference is, one has learned to market themselves.\n\nI feel before we go any further we have to talk about the artist mindset. The thought of being a salesperson scares most artists or they feel they do not need to sell it their art as it cheapens it. Or maybe they feel if the art is good enough, it will sell itself. Whatever the reason, we have to get out of this passive mindset and jump into a pro-active mindset. We have to learn to shout about our work, how to present it to others, find ways to get it in front of people's faces and make sure those people are the correct people. I used to live in the artist mindset myself, and it is not fun worrying about money, it is one of the biggest causes of creative block; anxiety, fear, and living from month to month. With financial stability comes creative freedom. Learning how to be a salesperson will not take anything away from your artist's credibility, but it will help you to sustain the freedom of living and creativity that you have always dreamed of. So before we move on, get it into your mind, you MUST learn how to market.\n\nSchedule Time to Market\n\nWhen I first started my marketing plan I had no idea where to start or what to do. But you have to start somewhere. I downloaded a weekly planner template from Google and crossed off one day a week as a marketing day. For the first few weeks, I used that day to watch tutorials on marketing, Google marketing techniques, and to talk to friends about their marketing strategies. I would suggest you mark off at least one full day of marketing. With a full 8 hours of focussed marketing, I am sure you will start to see the benefits early on. I usually plan two days into my week, plus I do a little marketing every other day as it comes up. Just like anything in life the more you do something the better you get at it, so the choice is yours.\n\nActive Marketing\n\nMarketing has to be very pro-active, you have to be actively looking for clients. Just because you create great art and you post it on Facebook or Instagram, it does not mean that you are marketing. Clients will rarely find you, you have to go to them. Look for a problem you can solve for a client. Find gaps in the market where you can add value. Be an artist who can solve the problem of any client and the work will come rolling in.\n\nMarketing Spokes\n\nThere are many spokes to the marketing wheel, the more spokes you have the more stable your wheel will be. Some of my spokes are:\n\nEmail Marketing\n\nWebsite\n\nBlogs\n\nSocial Media Marketing\n\nNetworking\n\nIn-person meetings\n\nCase studies\/client list\n\nPitching\n\nFollow-ups\n\nAgencies\n\nEach of these has its subcategory -- for example, Email marketing includes list building, cold emails, targeted emails, and mass emails. Every extra marketing spoke will strengthen your wheel and create a more sustainable journey. Again you have to be very proactive when marketing with these tools. Some days I will spend 6 hours or more emailing people. Some days I will only get two replies. It is about building the discipline to keep doing these things even when it feels like it might not be working. Its a game of persistence and you have to get in front of as many relevant clients, brands, or businesses as possible.\n\nThe Hidden Goal of Marketing\n\nOnce your marketing game begins to evolve, you are building lists and slowly you are starting to build up relationships with clients, you will start to realize that marketing has a hidden meaning. Yes, it is to get your work out into the world, yes it is gain more clients. But the one thing that seems to be overlooked most of the time is that marketing has a hidden goal and that is to build trust. There is no point in marketing if the people you market to never leap to hire your services or buy your work. And let us be honest, that is the overall goal. To gain the trust of these brands, businesses, and clients we need to be in a relationship, and this relationship is what you are building by proxy through your marketing. This is why case studies, blog posts, follow-ups, quick in-person chats, and networking are just as important as getting your art seen. If you can build a relationship you can earn the trust, which in turn will make pitching far easier and more likely to be successful.\n\nI hope this info sinks into any budding creatives out there thinking about doing this crazy job full time. The hard news is, it is not all photos shoots and laughter. A lot of the time you have to do the boring work, that pushes the art out. If you can get into the marketing mindset early I can guarantee you will outrun the competition who is not. Learn about pipelines, cold emails. Schedule in real marketing time, come up with systems and techniques and have the discipline to stick to them. I hated marketing in the beginning but now I enjoy the challenge, it is just another way to grow as a creative. If you can turn it into a game, find the fun in it, once you start seeing the results it will all be worth it. You have a choice, starving artist or successful creative, the choice is yours!","641":"Illinois tight end Jameson Geers commits to Gophers, forgoing offers from Iowa, Wisconsin The Gophers landed a commitment from a heavily recruited tight end Thursday, when Jameson Geers announced he has picked Minnesota.\n\nGeers, a consensus three-star recruit from New Lenox, Ill., also had offers from Iowa, Wisconsin, Northwestern, Purdue and Illinois.

Stereotyped folding in specific cortical locations could be explained by a corresponding anatomical pattern of genetic influences on cortical development, but no direct evidence supports this explanation. Here, we use high-resolution brain MRI to show the existence of the predicted pattern of genetic influences on the thickness of the cerebral cortex, leveraging the prediction that shared genetic influences during development create covariability of cortical thickness in adult neuroanatomy. Anatomically local covariability in cortical thickness has a genetic basis, is symmetric between cortical hemispheres, shows consistency across independent datasets, and may influence patterns of surface folding on the human brain.\n\nRecent progress in deciphering mechanisms of human brain cortical folding leave unexplained whether spatially patterned genetic influences contribute to this folding. High-resolution in vivo brain MRI can be used to estimate genetic correlations (covariability due to shared genetic factors) in interregional cortical thickness, and biomechanical studies predict an influence of cortical thickness on folding patterns. However, progress has been hampered because shared genetic influences related to folding patterns likely operate at a scale that is much more local (<1 cm) than that addressed in prior imaging studies. Here, we develop methodological approaches to examine local genetic influences on cortical thickness and apply these methods to two large, independent samples. We find that such influences are markedly heterogeneous in strength, and in some cortical areas are notably stronger in specific orientations relative to gyri or sulci. The overall, phenotypic local correlation has a significant basis in shared genetic factors and is highly symmetric between left and right cortical hemispheres. Furthermore, the degree of local cortical folding relates systematically with the strength of local correlations, which tends to be higher in gyral crests and lower in sulcal fundi. The relationship between folding and local correlations is stronger in primary sensorimotor areas and weaker in association areas such as prefrontal cortex, consistent with reduced genetic constraints on the structural topology of association cortex. Collectively, our results suggest that patterned genetic influences on cortical thickness, measurable at the scale of in vivo MRI, may be a causal factor in the development of cortical folding.","643":"Immunotoxin SS1P is rapidly removed by proximal tubule cells of kidney, whose damage contributes to albumin loss in urine This paper shows that the major pathway of degradation of immunotoxins in mice is rapid filtration through the glomerulus of the kidney and degradation by proximal tubular cells. It also shows that SS1P treatment damages proximal tubular cells and enhances loss of albumin in the urine, which can contribute to capillary leak syndrome, a major side effect of immunotoxin therapy. Because lysine administration diminishes kidney uptake of SS1P, it could also protect against SS1P-induced capillary leak syndrome.\n\nRecombinant immunotoxins (RITs) are chimeric proteins composed of an Fv and a protein toxin being developed for cancer treatment. The Fv brings the toxin to the cancer cell, but most of the RITs do not reach the tumor and are removed by other organs. To identify cells responsible for RIT removal, and the pathway by which RITs reach these cells, we studied SS1P, a 63-kDa RIT that targets mesothelin-expressing tumors and has a short serum half-life. The major organs that remove RIT were identified by live mouse imaging of RIT labeled with FNIR-Z-759. Cells responsible for SS1P removal were identified by immunohistochemistry and intravital two-photon microscopy of kidneys of rats. The primary organ of SS1P removal is kidney followed by liver. In the kidney, SS1P passes through the glomerulus, is taken up by proximal tubular cells, and transferred to lysosomes. In the liver, macrophages are involved in removal. The short half-life of SS1P is due to its very rapid filtration by the kidney followed by degradation in proximal tubular cells of the kidney. In mice treated with SS1P, proximal tubular cells are damaged and albumin in the urine is increased. SS1P uptake by kidney is reduced by coadministration of l-lysine. Our data suggests that l-lysine administration to humans might prevent SS1P-mediated kidney damage, reduce albumin loss in urine, and alleviate capillary leak syndrome.","644":"Impact of HPV vaccine hesitancy on cervical cancer in Japan: a modelling study Funding for human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in Japan began in 2010 for girls aged 12-16 years, with three-dose coverage initially reaching more than 70%. On June 14, 2013, 2 months after formal inclusion in Japan's national immunisation programme, proactive recommendations for the HPV vaccine were suspended following reports of adverse events since found to be unrelated to vaccination, but which were extensively covered in the media. Vaccine coverage subsequently dropped to less than 1% and has remained this low to date. We aimed to quantify the impact of this vaccine hesitancy crisis, and the potential health gains if coverage can be restored.","645":"In Berlin, hyper-gentrification has proved just how fast conflict-torn cities can change The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations\n\nModern day Kreuzberg is one of Berlin's most trendy and multicultural neighbourhoods. Its central location, dynamic mix of cafes, shops and nightlife, alongside residential streets and lucrative river views all fuse to embody a vibrant urban lifestyle. Kreuzberg encapsulates many of the remarkable elements that make Berlin one of the most attractive German cities to live in today, as well as a leading tourist destination and a hub for the international cosmopolitan elite.\n\nOver the past few decades, hundreds of thousands of people have chosen to settle in the reunified heart of the German capital. From 2012 to 2017 alone, the city grew by 243,500 people - 81% of which were foreigners. As a result, the previously peripheral and impoverished neighbourhood of Kreuzberg has, for some years, been undergoing an extreme process of hyper-gentrification. This has meant that long-term but less affluent residents have been priced out by skyrocketing demand for property, fuelled by global investors and wealthier locals. All too often, it's a process that occurs along lines of class, race and ethnicity.\n\nHyper-gentrification comes as a mixed blessing, especially in a city once torn by conflict, such as Berlin. There are positive and negative impacts on local residents. But amid such complexities, it is still regarded by ousted residents as social cleansing, as a stimulating neighbourhood life is lost to the predatory practices of the real estate entrepreneurs. Berlin is an extreme example of just how rapidly cities can respond when a new political and economic status quo asserts itself - and proof that even during peace time, there is a need for urban citizens to unite and fight injustice.\n\nThe divided city\n\nThe border within Berlin was first imposed by the Potsdam Agreement in August 1945. But it wasn't until August 1961 that the Soviet Union installed the wall, over the course of just two weeks - nominally to prevent \"facists\" from entering the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), but also to stem the flood of outward migration. Until the border was sealed, some 2.7m East Germans moved to the west.\n\nToday it's almost impossible to imagine that, just 30 years ago, Kreuzberg was at the front line of the conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States. Located on the Western side of the Iron Curtain's demilitarised border zone, the neighbourhood was a rundown frontier precinct. Sniper fire from the eastern border guards was a daily reality, and at night the area would be floodlit to detect defectors from the Eastern bloc.\n\nThough poorly maintained, the neighbourhood's cheap housing attracted migrant workers - predominantly from Turkey - who settled in Kreuzberg from the early 1970s and who still make up a significant part of its large and diverse immigrant population. This heritage survives today in the form of some local shops and a famous Turkish food market near the Landwehr Canal.\n\nMaking history\n\nThe wall stood for 10,316 days, with military fortifications dividing and tightly sealing the streets and public spaces that once formed the city's civic centre. When citizens started tearing down the Berlin wall on November 9, 1989, it marked the return of the original urban core. People flooded across the defunct border to see the other side of their own city for the first time in more than 28 years.\n\nThe powerful symbolism of this moment cannot be overstated. But the process of healing that came afterwards was arguably just as significant. Both sides of the city benefited from community groups coming together - with strong support from the federal government - to regenerate Berlin's heart, where the wall once stood. The rebuilding and renewal of the nation's capital came to represent postwar healing and remembrance, and Berlin became an international poster child for peace and optimism.\n\nBerlin's urban transformation continues to foster hope for cities still divided by national conflicts: Baghdad, Beirut, Jerusalem, Mostar, Nicosia, Kirkuk and Sarajevo - to name but a few of the most widely known cases. Though there's little chance of complete reconciliation in these cities under the current circumstances, it's nevertheless clear that, with the right political momentum, a rapid process of urban renewal can take place.\n\nBreaking down barriers\n\nThis hope is crucial, because walls can physically embed inequalities within the fabric of a city - from restricting access to basic utilities such as water and electricity (like Lima's wall of shame), to segregating citizens by ethnicity, race or religion (like Belfast's peace walls) and placing limits on minorities' control and development of (as in Jerusalem). And it's concerning that, in the 21st century, they seem to be becoming an ever more common feature of urban areas - for example, in the form of gated communities.\n\nYet bringing down the Iron Curtain overnight ended decades of bitter rivalry, which just days earlier seemed a rock-solid fact. Though inequalities still exist, Kreuzberg's pivotal shift from the front line of the Cold War, to the centrepiece of a united and vibrant urban core, has shown that urban planning and policy can be critical tools in designing an effective, attractive, functional city.\n\nOf course, the issues caused by hyper-gentrification must still be addressed. But Berlin's endorsement of a grassroots push to renationalise homes from corporate landlords, as well as measures to limit the purchase of flats for holiday rentals, seem to confirm that a strong urban planning system can work to balance the interests of various groups (public and private) and communities within the city, under an umbrella that protects the public interest, and allows the city to flourish.\n\nBerlin is proof that divided cities can become whole again, within the course of a few decades. But more than that, the city's transformation shows how vital it is for governments and citizens to be cognisant of new forms of injustice, to organise and use the tools at their disposal to confront the unique and unprecedented political, social and environmental challenges of the 21st century.","646":"In silico design and validation of high-affinity RNA aptamers targeting epithelial cellular adhesion molecule dimers This article requires a subscription to view the full text. If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nEpithelial cellular activating molecule (EpCAM) is vastly overexpressed in tumor cell membranes of certain carcinomas, and thus represents an auspicious clinical target for cancer therapies. To date, therapeutic targeting of EpCAM has principally involved antibodies; smaller, nucleic-acid based aptamers have shown great promise, but have not yet reached clinical application. Here, using experimentally validated in silico techniques, we have designed two RNA aptamers that bind EpCAM with improved affinity over existing aptamers. We confirm that these aptamers bind the EpCAM dimer, a complex distinct from and more physiologically relevant than the oft-targeted EpCAM monomer. This successful structure-based in silico approach advocates for the broad use of such methods in RNA aptamer design.","647":"In uncertain times, Virginia parents adapt to a new normal In uncertain times, Virginia parents adapt to a new normal March 23, 2020 Printer-Friendly Email Article Reprints Comments\n\nROANOKE, Va. (AP) -- Sudden statewide school closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic have led to an adjustment period for parents and students across the region.\n\nWhile school districts are being lenient with requirements, learning must continue at some level. Parents around the region are finding creative ways to keep their children engaged outside of the traditional classroom while tackling unprecedented challenges. Science experiments, outdoor adventures and more are now a part of local parents' curriculum.\n\nCassie Pillis-Gent, a mother of two sons, ages 9 and 7, has taken the impromptu opportunity to go beyond instructional packets and focus on hands-on learning. She plans to keep her sons busy with puzzles, Legos, cooking and baking, and outdoor activities.\n\n\"They will do their assignments, but I want them to get their wiggles out,\" Pillis-Gent said on March 17 from her Roanoke home.\n\nBrittany Turman, the mother of a pre-K student, said she is also trying to mix in unique lessons with traditional learning. Turman said she took her son for a walk around their Fincastle property on March 17 and then made butter in a jar as a science experiment to eat with their St. Patrick's Day dinner.\n\n\"Since my son is in preschool, there isn't much of a 'plan' for learning while closed, so I got creative,\" she said in a Facebook message. \"My son is a mover and a shaker, with a big interest in science, so I'm trying to focus on what I know he loves, slipping in the other stuff to keep skills sharp.\"\n\nLesley Harrop said it's been important to let her four children take a major role in determining the daily schedule, while ensuring it's somewhat similar to their school schedule to make the transition easier.\n\nShe's also created learning centers throughout her Roanoke County home: a math desk, story time rug, science table and art center.\n\n\"This helps set the expectations clearly for kids, and they thrive when expectations are clear and identifiable,\" she said.\n\nTACKLING PANDEMIC CHALLENGES\n\nThe shutdown has led to unique challenges that don't always present themselves during a scheduled break or even an unscheduled snow day. For some parents, their workload has increased during the pandemic. Others are struggling to find child care; many centers and afterschool programs also have closed down.\n\nTurman works from home producing digital events and said her workload has increased with cancelations amid the pandemic. \"Juggling the schedule is the name of the game over here,\" she said. Activities like virtual yoga and Pilates have helped both mom and son remain calm.\n\nPeg McGuire, a mother of two sons, ages 9 and 13, echoed Turman's comments. McGuire works in public relations and marketing, so she said she's been \"slammed\" handling client work to communicate the crisis. With two sons at home now in Roanoke, she's had to go with the flow.\n\nShe said her 9-year-old interrupted a conference call to tell McGuire the family ran out of milk.\n\n\"Because to him, that was an emergency,\" she said.\n\nPillis-Gent is a stay-at-home mom, and she recognizes her family is lucky the closure won't take them too far out of their normal routine. But some of the usual comforts that breaks bring aren't there now.\n\nUsually, her sons have play dates with their friends on school breaks. Public health officials recommend people apply social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, which means increasing the physical space between people. Play dates, for now, are a thing of the past.\n\nSocial media can bridge that gap for older students and adults, but Pillis-Gent said the younger age group is uniquely affected without social media accounts.\n\n\"They are very distant from their friends,\" Pillis-Gent said. \"I think they get hit harder in some ways than other age groups.\"\n\nThe family doesn't leave the news on 24\/7, but Pillis-Gent said they have been up front with the boys to explain what is happening and why. She also brings up positive news with them, like talking about how scientists and doctors are working hard.\n\nThe boys enjoyed talking to their teachers by phone earlier this week. \"Their eyes just lit up,\" she said.\n\nJennifer Evans is trying to stay afloat amid a slowdown in business. She's a photographer and normally would be booked up with Easter photos.\n\n\"I can't really take my daughter with me to take photos, and I can't have people come here, so we're sort of at a standstill,\" Evans said.\n\n\"It's kind of like crickets right now,\" she added.\n\nShe's trying to make the best of her situation. On Wednesday afternoon, Evans said, mother and daughter planned to bake muffins. They've also been doing yoga, art projects and playing outside.\n\nHealth care workers have also been widely affected.\n\nHarrop is a community nurse and single mom, so she has been juggling working remotely and homeschooling by herself. Her job typically involves being out in the community, but she has transitioned to virtual meetings. She said the babysitting service Care.com is offering a free one-month premium membership to health care workers.\n\nIris Park and her husband both work in the health care field and have been adapting to ever-evolving changes. Park's two children have been able to attend their usual day care so far.\n\nShould the facilities close, Park's husband can take care of them because he started to work from their Roanoke home this week, she said. Park is a community liaison for a skilled nursing facility, so she anticipates she will continue reporting to work.\n\n\"It's always stressful with the uncertainty of the virus,\" Park said.\n\nHer family is utilizing virtual fitness and karate classes to stay active. Park also wants them to maintain \"some sense of normalcy.\"\n\nEDUCATORS OFFER ADVICE, RESOURCES\n\nWade Whitehead, a veteran teacher at Roanoke's Crystal Spring Elementary School, has published a list of home learning ideas that has made the rounds on the internet. The idea, he said, was to give parents ideas \"without necessarily using the Wild West we call the internet.\"\n\n\"I feel like as soon as we buckled into triage mode, our minds went straight to, 'How can I use the internet?' \" Whitehead said in an interview on Tuesday.\n\nHe wanted to \"engage and challenge and mystify\" students, he said.\n\nWhitehead also said that some teachers have websites, which offer additional resources. Acknowledging that \"so many of our households lack internet and\/or reliable devices,\" Whitehead said there are still other options, like reading and completing the low-tech activities on his list.\n\nMany Roanoke-area parents, including Harrop, McGuire, Park and Turman, belong to a Facebook group called \"Roanoke MOMS survive CORONA.\" It had more than 1,400 members by Wednesday morning (dads are welcome, too). Parents within the group support one another and share ideas.\n\nMary Catherine Tatoy, one of the administrators of the group, also runs a website called \"Fun-A-Day\" that has free educational resources for pre-K and elementary-aged students. Tatoy has a background in early childhood education and has taught pre-K and kindergarten.

Mark Dayton on Tuesday lambasted House Republicans for what he called an \"insufficient\" education budget bill, and he said he will be calling legislators back for a special session to hammer out a new agreement on public schools spending.\n\nThe news conference followed a frenzied, last-minute push by the Legislature to pass major budget bills ahead of a midnight deadline Tuesday.\n\nDayton followed through on his earlier promise, issuing a veto letter addressed to House Speaker Kurt Daudt that said it's \"incomprehensible that estate tax cuts for millionaires and property tax relief for large corporations are higher priorities for your House Republican Caucus than investing adequately in our students and young children.\"\n\nDayton staffers and House leadership worked right up until the legislative deadline to broker a deal that would avert the governor's veto.\n\nThe DFL governor confirmed an earlier Star Tribune report that he was willing to accept $125 million in spending above the $400 million the bill contained. He said he would also drop his insistence on universal prekindergarten if Republicans had provided funding for some of his other priorities, including funding to eliminate a Head Start waiting list and additional funding for Bureau of Indian Education schools.\n\nDayton said the money would have gone to school readiness programs, a decision he said he wasn't \"thrilled\" about but that he showed good faith in negotiations with Republicans.","649":"In-game update: Byron Buxton makes progress FORT MYERS, Fla. -- Byron Buxton, who is on the rehab trail following shoulder surgery, will take live batting practice on Tuesday.\n\nIt will be the first time he's done so in camp, which is a sign that he's making progress.\n\nMore details to come.\n\nThe Twins are expected to announce their first cuts of camp today following their game against the Cardinals at Hammond Stadium.\n\nNothing major is expected, and you can probably figure out yourself who might be headed down the road. Players who have had limited appearances or who have had an injury setback back normally are the ones to get sent out.\n\nFor instance, I would guess that Fernando Romero would be on the list, since he's not in camp (customs\/visa issues) and has no chance of making the roster. Lewis Thorpe, away from camp for personal reasons, could be another cut.\n\nAlso, I checked with the Twins on the subject of disinfecting their clubhouse because of the Coronavirus outbreak. Some sports teams have ordered to have their dressing facilities disinfected because of concerns about the virus. The Twins have not done so, but they might do so if they feel the need.\n\nOnce the regular season starts, they have the clubhouse at Target Field disinfected about once a month.\n\nJosh Donaldson is appearing in back-to-back spring games for the first time, but it's probably because he's not on the long trip to Clearwater tomorrow.\n\nMiguel Sano is back in the lineup since hitting a long home run on Saturday during the game against the Tigers, a game played in his home country of the Dominican Republic.

To assess the risk of such resistance emerging, we evaluated influenza A and B viruses carrying BXM-reduced susceptibility substitutions and compared their fitness to that of their drug-susceptible wild-type (I38-WT) counterparts. The 38T\/F\/M substitutions inhibited activity of the virus PA protein, and two of them (38T\/F) hindered virus replication in cells. Even so, 38T\/F\/M viruses could transmit between ferrets, the gold-standard model for human transmission. These findings argue that there is a risk of transmission of BXM-resistant viruses from treated individuals. Whether such viruses could compete with WT viruses in spreading through the wider untreated community is less clear.\n\nBaloxavir marboxil (BXM) was approved in 2018 for treating influenza A and B virus infections. It is a first-in-class inhibitor targeting the endonuclease activity of the virus polymerase acidic (PA) protein. Clinical trial data revealed that PA amino acid substitutions at residue 38 (I38T\/F\/M) reduced BXM potency and caused virus rebound in treated patients, although the fitness characteristics of the mutant viruses were not fully defined. To determine the fitness impact of the I38T\/F\/M substitutions, we generated recombinant A\/California\/04\/2009 (H1N1)pdm09, A\/Texas\/71\/2017 (H3N2), and B\/Brisbane\/60\/2008 viruses with I38T\/F\/M and examined drug susceptibility in vitro, enzymatic properties, replication efficiency, and transmissibility in ferrets. Influenza viruses with I38T\/F\/M substitutions exhibited reduced baloxavir susceptibility, with 38T causing the greatest reduction. The I38T\/F\/M substitutions impaired PA endonuclease activity as compared to that of wild-type (I38-WT) PA. However, only 38T\/F A(H3N2) substitutions had a negative effect on polymerase complex activity. The 38T\/F substitutions decreased replication in cells among all viruses, whereas 38M had minimal impact. Despite variable fitness consequences in vitro, all 38T\/M viruses disseminated to naive ferrets by contact and airborne transmission, while 38F-containing A(H3N2) and B viruses failed to transmit via the airborne route. Reversion of 38T\/F\/M to I38-WT was rare among influenza A viruses in this study, suggesting stable retention of 38T\/F\/M genotypes during these transmission events. BXM reduced susceptibility-associated mutations had variable effects on in vitro fitness of influenza A and B viruses, but the ability of these viruses to transmit in vivo indicates a risk of their spreading from BXM-treated individuals.","663":"Influenza hemagglutinin drives viral entry via two sequential intramembrane mechanisms This article requires a subscription to view the full text.

Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nViral proteins that accomplish membrane fusion between the virus and a host cell do two things: draw virus and host membranes together and act within these membranes to induce fusion. This second property is much less well understood than the first. We have used molecular dynamics simulations approximating influenza virus fusion to obtain a model of how influenza proteins promote fusion within interacting membranes. This model helps explain previous mutational data and new experiments. Viral fusion proteins have long been thought to curve and disorder membranes; we can now specify when and how this is accomplished. This provides a better fundamental understanding of viral entry and a basis for interpreting host defenses that act on membranes to interfere with infection.","664":"Inhibition mechanisms of AcrF9, AcrF8, and AcrF6 against type I-F CRISPR-Cas complex revealed by cryo-EM CRISPR-Cas systems are widely distributed adaptive immune systems in prokaryotes that protect against invading genetic materials. To survive inside the prokaryotic host cells, viruses have developed various strategies to compromise the CRISPR-Cas systems, including the anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins. Here, we report three atomic models of AcrF9, AcrF8, and AcrF6, each of which is found to bind to the type I-F CRISPR-Cas system differently using cryo-EM. These structures guide mutagenesis and biochemical experiments to derive their mechanisms to produce anti-CRISPR activities. Our data show their diverse modes of interactions but yield the same effect in barring the degradation of the viral DNA.\n\nProkaryotes and viruses have fought a long battle against each other. Prokaryotes use CRISPR-Cas-mediated adaptive immunity, while conversely, viruses evolve multiple anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins to defeat these CRISPR-Cas systems. The type I-F CRISPR-Cas system in Pseudomonas aeruginosa requires the crRNA-guided surveillance complex (Csy complex) to recognize the invading DNA. Although some Acr proteins against the Csy complex have been reported, other relevant Acr proteins still need studies to understand their mechanisms. Here, we obtain three structures of previously unresolved Acr proteins (AcrF9, AcrF8, and AcrF6) bound to the Csy complex using electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM), with resolution at 2.57 \u00c5, 3.42 \u00c5, and 3.15 \u00c5, respectively. The 2.57-\u00c5 structure reveals fine details for each molecular component within the Csy complex as well as the direct and water-mediated interactions between proteins and CRISPR RNA (crRNA). Our structures also show unambiguously how these Acr proteins bind differently to the Csy complex. AcrF9 binds to key DNA-binding sites on the Csy spiral backbone. AcrF6 binds at the junction between Cas7.6f and Cas8f, which is critical for DNA duplex splitting. AcrF8 binds to a distinct position on the Csy spiral backbone and forms interactions with crRNA, which has not been seen in other Acr proteins against the Csy complex. Our structure-guided mutagenesis and biochemistry experiments further support the anti-CRISPR mechanisms of these Acr proteins. Our findings support the convergent consequence of inhibiting degradation of invading DNA by these Acr proteins, albeit with different modes of interactions with the type I-F CRISPR-Cas system.","665":"Inject some sparkle in to your commute with these 7 beauty podcasts I would like to receive trends and interviews from fashion, lifestyle to travel every week, by email\n\nJust when you thought we'd reached peak podcast, you were wrong.\n\nThe number of weekly podcast listeners has almost doubled in five years - from 3 million in 2013 to 6 million in 2018.\n\nAnd while we have unequivocally broadened our listening horizons, from gripping true crime to laugh-a-minute comedy duos, a new batch of shows has cropped up which are dedicated to all things make-up, skincare and wellness.\n\nEnter the world of beauty podcasts.\n\nThis assortment of beauty aficionados are channelling their expertise and opinions into episodes crammed with answers to all of the cosmetic questions you've been dying to ask (but have felt too stupid to admit to not knowing.)\n\nHosted, and co-hosted, by beauty editors, creators and influencers alike, these podcast episodes are sure to add a sparkle to even the most arduous commutes.\n\nWhen trying to decipher the useful beauty advice from the utterly useless, let only the expertise of former magazine editors Jill Dunn and Carlene Higgins, permeate your brain.\n\nTheir podcast, Breaking Beauty, lifts the lid on breakthrough trends and products, while discussing them with a bevy of beauty boffins, Glossier's Emily Weiss, Anastasia Beverly Hills founder Anastasia Soare and the Bobbi Brown to name just a few.\n\nListen here.\n\nThere's a reason this podcast regularly courts a top spot in the coveted Top 10 on the iTunes Arts charts.

Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nPhenotypic evolution is driven primarily by natural selection but the majority of differences between the genomes of related species are thought to be neutral. Because of this, linking differences in phenotype to underlying genetic changes is challenging. Here, we applied evolutionary sequence analysis methods to comprehensively identify sites that evolved under positive selection in mammals and used available protein structures to link them to molecular mechanisms. This allowed us to detect clusters of positively selected sites in proteins involved in immunity, as well as enzymes that detoxify foreign chemicals, and demonstrate that those sites tend to localize to functionally important regions. Our findings suggest that, in addition to functional similarities, there are common structural features and mechanisms underpinning adaptive evolution.","667":"Interleukin-2 druggability is modulated by global conformational transitions controlled by a helical capping switch Contributed by K. Christopher Garcia, February 14, 2020 (sent for review January 9, 2020; reviewed by Lewis E. Kay and Gerhard Wagner)\n\nAn extensive body of work has revealed that the conformational plasticity of IL-2 plays an important role in targeting the IL-2 receptor signaling axis in both agonist and antagonist mode; however, a more detailed understanding of such processes is needed for actionable value in drug development. Using mouse IL-2 as a model, our current body of work combines methyl-based chemical exchange NMR spectroscopy (CPMG and CEST) with thermodynamic measurements and immunoassays to characterize a global conformational transition to a sparsely populated autoinhibited conformational state, together with its functional significance. Targeting this minor state through mutations and small molecules can be exploited to fine tune the affinity and selectivity for different IL-2 binding partners, toward engineering novel cytokine functions.","668":"International Women's Day: Sachin Tendulkar's Tribute To \"5 Women\" Who Played \"Huge Role\" In His Life.

Before that, he was a pharmacist on remote Baffin Island in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. The surprising jump from pharmacist to adventure photographer actually makes sense when you hear Jones' story and could give hope to photographers out there who want to make the leap, but aren't sure where to start.\n\nNot long after earning his pharmacy degree, Curtis Jones realized he wasn't happy in his work. So, when the opportunity came to work on Baffin Island, Jones thought it would be the perfect chance to pay off his student loans while also expanding his horizons. He already had a lifelong love of outdoor sports like climbing, so although he would work as a pharmacist, the move sounded like an adventure right up his alley. Looking at the images Jones captured of the Canadian Arctic, it's easy to see how the stark beauty of the place inspired him to pick up photography as a hobby during his tenure. It was this hobby that landed him the kind of gig most aspiring adventure photographers would kill for.\n\nBaffin Island sits at the opening of the Northwest Passage, so meeting adventurous people was almost a given. While living there, Jones formed a friendship with Sarah and Eric McNair-Landry, a brother and sister adventuring team who needed a photographer for their snow-kite trek across the Greenland Ice Cap. They weren't worried about his lack of expeditionary experience, because they could train anyone, but they said they needed someone who would be a reliable team member with a compatible personality. As you've already guessed, he didn't turn them down. What he did do was quit his job and sell off almost everything he owned so he could afford to start training for the trip. The team completed the expedition unassisted, meaning there were no drop points for things like food or gear, a couple of days under their deadline as the first Canadians to traverse the Greenland Ice Sheet by snowkite. With sponsors like National Geographic, Jones' career as an adventure photographer was off to a resounding start, and with little more than a Canon Rebel.\n\nWith their next adventure in the Gobi desert, Jones found himself riding a wave of success and working with international sponsorship, something most adventure photographers dream about. Yet, over the course of the next three years, Jones realized that price of riding the wave so early in his career was not having time to discover whether working with large sponsors on expeditions was something he actually wanted. He said that there is a sense of urgency in that kind of work, of never really being able to rest, because there is a constant hustle of chasing sponsors and trying to find the next biggest, most unique adventure. There was always someone else right behind you ready to do it bigger. \"You have to work hard to stay relevant in that world,\" he said, \"and you realize you're replaceable.\" Companies are able to leverage social media more and more, which makes the market more competitive, even for something as niche as adventure photography. While that is a dream life for some people, Jones realized it wasn't right for him. He needed to find a way to make his new career fit his heart.\n\nJones traveled, found mentors, and experimented with different kinds of photography. He discovered he enjoyed writing and realized that his passion for the work actually lay in using photography as a way of connecting people to their environment, and through that connection, helping them understand themselves better. He began work with a social enterprise with a focus on implementing projects that improve the viability of the traditional economy, and commercial work to bring awareness to local harvesters that could form a link in the chain of a sustainable food industry that would also help small local economies. He built a company called Newfound Shores with fellow Canadian photographer extraordinaire Renee Robyn that gets photographers outside and engaged in the unique environment around Newfoundland, his home, and he leads photo expeditions on behalf of other companies that help people find their own adventures while fostering a love of the environment and admiration for the people who make their homes there.\n\nJones' path might not be the right path for every budding adventure photographer, but I think it mirrors the journey of many photographers in important ways. We all start off full of passion, but not as full of direction. Sometimes, it takes surprising sacrifices and more investment than we're prepared for, but if we're willing to chase our own idea of success, we end up exactly where we want to be, doing work we love.\n\nWhen I asked Jones what advice he would give to photographers feeling the pull of an adventurous life, he broke down some solid steps that could help them find their feet.\n\nAdventure photography is a big umbrella that covers a lot of niche work. Break down why you are drawn to the work so you know how to move forward. Is it the production and big punchy commercial images you are intrigued by? Is it telling the story of the people you photograph in extreme locations? Is it the environment? Once you know, you can begin building your plans. Start practicing that kind of work and build up a compelling portfolio that tells a story. Use other people's work as examples to get started, but focus on your own perspective and try to tell the story only you can tell. Don't wait for someone to approach you. There are a lot of photographers out there, so it probably won't happen. Start making your own projects based on things you care about. Give yourself permission to start. You don't have to be \"the guy with a tent and a camera.\" You can grab a friend and head to a local park. Think creatively about how you can use your skill and the space to tell a story. Don't wait until your work is perfect. That won't happen either. Just get started. You'll learn as you go. Approach the kind of people you want to work with. You can start with local businesses or outfitters to gain experience. As with all photography, this takes time. The investment is always heavy on the front end, but if you stay committed and remember why you love this work, you'll get there.\n\nMy favorite part about this interview was how much Jones' journey mirrors the journey of every photographer, despite being wildly different in the details. Aside from his great advice, I think the best takeaway is that it's worthwhile not to settle for some predefined idea of success. We need to spend some time in self exploration and discover why we want to do this thing called photography and how we can bend and shape it to suit our hearts. We need to realize that other things, like writing, teaching, or guiding others can become valuable contributors to our careers. And if we're willing to commit, life as a photographer is its own adventure.\n\nImages used with permission of Curtis Jones.","670":"Interview: Gita Ramjee The HIV researcher at the centre of a row over clinical trials tells Linda Nordling why she will never give up\n\nMonths have passed, but Professor Gita Ramjee still recoils at the memory of events that came close to robbing South Africa of one of its top scientists. \"There came a point when I thought: is it worth my while? I have dedicated my life to finding an HIV prevention option for the women of Africa, and these recent attempts to tarnish my efforts have been very demotivating.\"\n\nIt is fitting that we meet on a day when freak waves and high winds are causing widespread damage along the Kwa-Zulu Natal coastline. A storm of a different kind rocked her research unit recently. A storm less forceful perhaps, but more damaging to those inside.\n\nIn January, Ramjee, director of the HIV prevention research unit in Durban, received the news that a routine inspection by an external team of experts had discovered anomalies in data from a study of a potential new microbicide to protect women against HIV\/Aids. Alarmingly, more women receiving the vaginal preparation of cellulose sulphate appeared to have developed HIV, compared with the group not receiving the product. Although the numbers were very small, the external team decided to halt the trial for safety reasons.\n\nA press release was issued explaining that the treatment \"might\" increase women's chances of HIV infection. Test products were recalled from the 1,333 women participating in South Africa, Benin, Uganda and India, and Conrad, the US-based sponsor of the trial, ordered a review to shed light on what had happened.\n\nPress field day\n\nRamjee wished it could have stopped there. But it didn't. The press had a field day with what was incorrectly christened a \"botched\" trial. Some called the women testing the drug \"guinea pigs\", encouraged by the scientists to have unprotected sex using the gel as an aphrodisiac. \"I think the whole world was horrified that certain South African press could stoop so low. That they could misunderstand an issue so much,\" says Ramjee\n\nThe articles were not just damaging to other HIV prevention efforts at the unit, but to clinical trials as a whole, she says. \"Negative press such as this can destroy HIV prevention efforts. We need to have a united front, with civil society and scientists working together to address the problem and applauding volunteers who come forward to find solutions.\" But she admits her unit could have done more to prevent what happened. \"In future, I would like to do it better, get the press involved, make them understand the science and interpretation of data.\"\n\nIn the aftermath, Ramjee received strong support from her colleagues, sponsors and even from participants in the trials. The last tried to put the record straight with the press. \"Don't tell us that we are guinea pigs, we know exactly what we're doing, and can think for ourselves,\" they told the journalists. Did the press print their stories? \"No.\"\n\nBut Ramjee's heart sank. It felt like the very people she had dedicated her life to help had turned against her. \"At the time I was very, very depressed.\" But she did not give up. \"A lot of people said to me: if you, one of the best clinical trialists in the world, don't continue with this fight against HIV\/Aids, who will? So you have to motivate yourself again.\"\n\nSuch dedication to what she values most is a recurring phenomenon in Ramjee's life. Not for her the latte-sipping existence enjoyed by some of her contemporaries. \"I'm not the type of woman who likes to spend hours at shopping centres with friends,\" she says. Instead, her life has revolved around her family and her career, with the former taking precedence.\n\nPerhaps it was the many upheavals of her youth that taught her to hold on to what could always be counted on: close family and her own faculties. Growing up in Uganda, her first experience of exile came at the hands of Idi Amin, the dictator who forced all Asians out of the country in the 1970s. After a couple of years in a high school in India, the land of her ancestors, she relocated again, this time to the University of Sunderland in the north-east of England.\n\nIt was in here that she met her future husband - a South African of Indian descent. In 1981, on finishing her degree, she followed him to South Africa. It was a culture shock. In the early 80s the apartheid regime was weakening, but still held on to power, particularly in the Transvaal region, from where her husband's family came. \"It was extremely difficult for somebody used to living in a multicultural, open society. As a student in England, you didn't look at colour. You looked at people as individuals.\"\n\nIn search of more liberal surroundings, the young couple moved to Durban. Here, Ramjee felt more at ease. She felt welcomed by people from a variety of backgrounds. \"I think it was nice for them to meet somebody who wasn't thinking in the past. I felt very comfortable living in Durban at that time.\" She got a job in paediatrics at a local hospital. This put her in the way of a masters degree and, ultimately, a PhD on the kidney diseases of children, which she completed in 1994.\n\nBy that time she had two sons whom she tried - sometimes in vain - to shelter from the idiosyncrasies of South African society. \"I was so determined, coming from a multicultural society, that I would never put my child in a single-race school.\" This was easier said than done, but in the end she succeeded.\n\nThe years of her doctorate saw Ramjee make superhuman efforts to stay on top of family and career. \"I used to get up at six in the morning, prepare food, wake my children, send them off to school, do a half day of practical work, come back, pick my sons up from school, help them do their homework and send them to sleep.\" She would then herself go to sleep at 8pm only to get up again at two in the morning to write her thesis. She kept this up for a year. \"I never gave up my responsibility as a parent. Although I wanted to excel in my career, I never wanted to compromise myself as a mother.\"\n\nNascent technology\n\nThe sacrifice paid off, but in a roundabout way. After her PhD, Ramjee wanted a break, but fearful of too much leisure time, she sought out a small project that would pass the time when her sons were at school. She found a small research project evaluating the acceptability of a vaginal microbicide, at that time a nascent technology in the armoury against HIV\/Aids. This work put her in contact with local sex workers - a \"reality check\" as she calls it.\n\n\"It opened my eyes. These are good women, who are put in a position that people scorn.\" In the mid-90s, when Ramjee started working with sex workers in Kwa-Zulu Natal, 50% were HIV positive. \"These women mostly aren't doing this out of choice. The stories they used to tell us were horrific. That's when I knew I wanted to be involved in the prevention of HIV infection in women.\"\n\nWhat began as a short project evolved into a strong commitment. In the years to follow, Ramjee worked her way up through the ranks to finally head the Durban unit. She inherited a staff of 21, and quickly built this into a 300-strong organisation with an international reputation for excellence.\n\nShe is matter of fact about her success: \"Because I did so well in clinical trials, I had offers pouring in for me to do clinical research. I think the key to success is my approach to capacity building, respecting each and every member of my staff, the community, and also the fact that I delivered on the contracts. It is my holistic approach to research, where I'm not just thinking science.\"\n\nToday, Ramjee is looking ahead. The final results of a recently completed trial on a vaginal diaphragm will be out in the next couple of months and other trials are also nearing completion. There is a long way to go. \"What people don't realise is that none of the current generation of microbicides or any other prevention technology is going to be 100% effective. So whether there are microbicides or a vaccine out there or not, there is nothing that will to allow you to go have unprotected sex without the risk of infection. Not for a long, long time.\"\n\nStill, the recent crisis has taught her the importance of striking a new work-life balance. \"In a way, I feel that while I'm passionate about my work, it is too consuming a passion. I need to find a more balanced situation, where I do things that I enjoy as well.\" But finding the time to do that will be difficult, she admits. \"It's in my nature to want to excel. My calling is to find a solution. If I don't succeed in my lifetime, at least I've worked towards it.\"\n\nCurriculum vitae\n\nAge: 50\n\nJob: Director of the HIV prevention research unit in Durban, South Africa\n\nLives: In Durban with her husband, a pharmacist\n\nLikes: spas, exotic travels\n\nDislikes: insincerity and dishonesty\n\nMarried:, with two sons","671":"Intrinsically disordered protein RBM14 plays a role in generation of RNA:DNA hybrids at double-strand break sites This article requires a subscription to view the full text.

Put them together.\"\n\nMicah, a fourth-grader at Resurrection Elementary School in Dubuque, figured out the word he was trying to read was \"lost.\" Then, his mom helped lead him through a full phrase.\n\n\"So you've lost your front teeth,\" Micah read.\n\nMicah is among an estimated 5% to 17.5% of the population who has dyslexia, a language-processing disorder that causes difficulties with reading.\n\nChildren like Micah have come into focus for Iowa lawmakers in recent years, prompting them to consider a bill to help schools better serve students with the disorder, according to the Dubuque Telegraph Herald.\n\nOfficials from area schools said they do not diagnose dyslexia. However, they seek to create special-education programs that help students with reading difficulties, whatever the cause.\n\n\"I don't feel that our current system fails students with dyslexia,\" said Brenda Duvel, executive director of special education for Dubuque Community Schools. \"We're meeting the needs of many students that have reading disabilities. Could we improve and learn more? Absolutely, we could.\"\n\nTask force\n\nLate last year, an Iowa dyslexia task force released a report calling for legislators and educators \"to make immediate and transformative action to support students with characteristics of dyslexia.\"\n\nMembers of the task force found that families struggle to obtain evaluations for dyslexia and that educators might not have the necessary expertise.\n\nEducators told the task force that they needed more resources to teach students with dyslexia and that some schools seemed resistant to acknowledge the disorder.\n\nLast month, the Iowa Senate passed a bill to establish a state dyslexia board and an advanced dyslexia specialist endorsement. Area education agencies would be required to employ dyslexia specialists.\n\n\"This is legislation that's going to be looking at all kids and how do we help each of our kids to live into their best life and become their best learner?\" said state Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque, who is on the subcommittee examining the bill in the state House of Representatives.\n\nLawmakers in other states also are putting a focus on dyslexia, with the subject coming up in both the Wisconsin and Illinois legislatures this year.\n\nSupporting students\n\nIn Iowa, students don't need a specific diagnosis to qualify for special-education services, said Duvel. So students don't have to be diagnosed with dyslexia to receive additional support.\n\nAny program the district adopts is based on evidence-based research, Duvel said, noting that the district uses programs endorsed for students with dyslexia.\n\nWhile having more information about a diagnosis is never a bad thing, she believes educators are able to get students the support they need with or without dyslexia diagnoses.\n\n\"We have lots of kids that have ... lower-level support all the way to very-intensive support and plans in order to support them in the area of reading,\" she said.\n\nKathleen Konrardy, special education coordinator for Holy Family Catholic Schools in Dubuque, said it is helpful to have an official diagnosis.\n\n\"If we have students we know have dyslexia ... then we can put some of those things in place,\" she said.\n\nTara Notz, director of professional development and student learning for the Maquoketa (Iowa) Community School District, said her district has focused on increasing support for reading instruction that helps students who have challenges.\n\n\"The more support and resources and specialized teachers that we have, I think it's going to be a positive thing for our students,\" she said.\n\nLearning differently\n\nAs her son was struggling to meet developmental milestones, Christine Ripperger sought an evaluation. He eventually was diagnosed with dyslexia, as well as dysgraphia and dyscalculia, which causes issues with writing and math, respectively.\n\nFor part of kindergarten, Micah dual-enrolled at Resurrection and Bryant Elementary School in Dubuque because staff at the public school offered a program that would help her son with his dyslexia.\n\nThe arrangement did not last long, however, because the timing of the services shifted and Ripperger was told Micah would miss too much classroom work. A teacher at Resurrection later received training to work with Micah so he could be enrolled full time at that school.\n\nThough Ripperger and Micah have navigated some challenges over the years, this year, they have a system of support that works well.\n\nIn addition to receiving reading services, Micah has several accommodations, like using text-to-speech and speech-to-text functions on his computer and a scribe to help write on worksheets for him.\n\n\"That's pretty much what dyslexia is, the ability to see things differently,\" Micah said. \"You look at something, (and) this is how you see it with your eyes, but your brain looks at it differently ... so that's why you need to learn differently.\"\n\nCopyright 2020 Associated Press.

Due to their in vitro antimicrobial activity, iron-binding proteins transferrins are suspected to play a role in iron sequestration. However, little is known about the in vivo role of transferrins. Here, we found that Drosophila melanogaster exhibits infection-induced hypoferremia mediated by Transferrin 1. Due to excessive iron in hemolymph, Transferrin 1 (Tsf1)-deficient flies are hypersusceptible to certain infections. Our study reveals that nutritional immunity is an important, previously unrecognized arm of immune defense in Drosophila. Using fly and bacterial genetics, we show that Tsf1 mediates nutritional immunity by sequestering iron from the pathogens in vivo on the whole-organism level.\n\nIron sequestration is a recognized innate immune mechanism against invading pathogens mediated by iron-binding proteins called transferrins. Despite many studies on antimicrobial activity of transferrins in vitro, their specific in vivo functions are poorly understood. Here we use Drosophila melanogaster as an in vivo model to investigate the role of transferrins in host defense. We find that systemic infections with a variety of pathogens trigger a hypoferremic response in flies, namely, iron withdrawal from the hemolymph and accumulation in the fat body. Notably, this hypoferremia to infection requires Drosophila nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) immune pathways, Toll and Imd, revealing that these pathways also mediate nutritional immunity in flies. Next, we show that the iron transporter Tsf1 is induced by infections downstream of the Toll and Imd pathways and is necessary for iron relocation from the hemolymph to the fat body. Consistent with elevated iron levels in the hemolymph, Tsf1 mutants exhibited increased susceptibility to Pseudomonas bacteria and Mucorales fungi, which could be rescued by chemical chelation of iron. Furthermore, using siderophore-deficient Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we discover that the siderophore pyoverdine is necessary for pathogenesis in wild-type flies, but it becomes dispensable in Tsf1 mutants due to excessive iron present in the hemolymph of these flies. As such, our study reveals that, similar to mammals, Drosophila uses iron limitation as an immune defense mechanism mediated by conserved iron-transporting proteins transferrins. Our in vivo work, together with accumulating in vitro studies, supports the immune role of insect transferrins against infections via an iron withholding strategy.","675":"Is Gophers coach Richard Pitino's job in jeopardy? 'I don't think it's reality,' he says Gophers coach Richard Pitino said he isn't concerned about his future with the program when asked Tuesday on his radio show if he felt his job was on the line for next season.\n\n\"I don't think it's reality,\" Pitino said. \"I don't feel like that. I think [the narrative has] been created in the last couple weeks, because we lost a couple home games.\"\n\nThe Gophers (13-15, 7-11) have lost six of their last eight games to drop out of NCAA tournament contention in the last month, which included down-to-the-wire losses to Iowa, Maryland and Sunday at Wisconsin by a combined six points.\n\nPitino, who received a two-year contract extension last year after winning an NCAA tournament game, said he hasn't addressed his job status with the team at all. But he admitted that \"I'm sure it has\" been a distraction with fans criticizing him on social media more recently.\n\n\"I've got a pretty good perspective,\" Pitino added Tuesday. \"This latest one has not flustered me as much as four years ago [during the 8-23 season]. I love Minnesota. I want to be here a long time.\"\n\nThis wasn't the first time the seventh-year Gophers coach shared his thoughts publicly on if he was worried about his job after so many tough losses this year.\n\nAfter a third straight home loss falling last Wednesday 74-73 against Maryland on a last-second three-pointer, Pitino expressed confidence in the direction of the program.\n\n\"In this profession, you think about your team, you think about your family and you try to stay confident,\" Pitino said then at his postgame news conference. \"Anytime you lose close games you have to evaluate every single game. I'm very, very confident in what we're doing here. I think our guys are really good kids and are getting better.\"\n\nThe Gophers' 71-69 loss Sunday at Wisconsin was the seventh loss by single digits in Big Ten play this year. They play Wednesday at Indiana, a rematch of a 68-56 home loss against the Hoosiers on Feb. 19.","676":"Is Molitor really a 'safe' choice? I got to work one day in my rookie year at the Minneapolis Tribune and was called into the editor's office. I was actually a temporary employee at the time, working nights and doing whatever needed to be done in the sports department, and that night what needed to be done was to go to Paul Molitor's house in St. Paul.\n\nHe'd just finished his rookie season in Milwaukee and his mother, Kathy, had just found out that Paul had been named the Sporting News Rookie of the Year among American League position players. She'd called, asking if we wanted to do a story. Paul would be hone in an hour or so, Kathy said.\n\nThere was only one condition: We couldn't tell Paul that mom had told us the news.\n\nI don't remember much about the story, but I remember sitting in the living room talking about this and that and some baseball and some other stuff. We were about the same age and had longer hair than we do now. He was engaging and smart. I've only talked to him a few of times since, including once at the Metrodome to offer condolences after his mom died. (Note to young journalists: Parents are great sources. Get to know 'em. Note to readers: Yeah, I'm probably older than you.)\n\nNow, on to what's happening with the Twins. The interesting thing about much of the angst over Molitor's selection being a safe choice is that it's really no such thing.\n\nIs it safe to hire a manager who hasn't held that job at any level? A Hall of Famer when the track record of really good players-turned-manages isn't good? A guy who was a union activist in his playing days? There are all kinds of things that would make Molitor look like an outside-the-box pick if it wasn't for his connections to the Twins and to the Pohlad family. (In addition to the baseball ties, one of Carl Pohlad's grandchildren and one of Molitor's children co-own a juice bar in Uptown.)\n\nSo the choice is between being cynical about the hire or wondering -- by accident or design -- if the Twins have latched themselves to a different kind of manager who can return the team to competence. For what it's worth, he was seen as an outsider in Ron Gardenhire's tightly knit coaching staff, which Molitor joined last season. He's interesting to listen to when he's talking baseball. I suspect there will be fewer quips and more depth coming from the manager's office.\n\nAs much as anything, I'm intrigued by how some of Molitor's experiences, beyond being an excellent hitter and base runner, will have an impact on the way he'll manage. He was a moved from position to position to position early in his career to make room for others, once expressing frustration by wondering publicly whether he'd become Milwaukee's closer if the future Hall of Famer Rollie Fingers left the team. His drug issues during the 1980s have been well chronicled, and may give him a better understanding than other managers of choices facing younger players. He was around the game long enough to know the impact and influence veteran players can have on less experienced ones. Maybe having several seasons cut short by injuries taught him about keys to staying healthy that can be applied to others.\n\nI got the impression from listening to Molitor on his first day of talking about the job that he feels a different tone needs to be set with the Twins. Tone doesn't win baseball games, but being a step ahead of what's happening on the field won't hurt. I was especially intrigued to read what Brian Dozier and Glen Perkins said about learning from Molitor in this story by Chip Scoggins. You can study baseball's advanced metrics, which are a good thing, all you want -- but examples cited by the players are a lesson in how the numbers can come alive on the field.\n\nIn Terry Ryan's role, you can get blasted for whatever choice you make, especially in hindsight.\n\nIf the highlight of Molitor's tenure is the words that were spoken at Target Field on Tuesday, shame on the Twins for choosing someone who'd never managed. If the Twins had chosen Doug Mientkiewicz and that flopped, shame on the Twins for thinking that success in the low minors would mean anything in the majors. Choose a coach with a good reputation from elsewhere and you'd wonder why that guy didn't get the other jobs he was seeking. Choose a guy who'd managed elsewhere and it's the old boys' club at work.\n\nOh, and there's this one: Pass over Joe Maddon? Using hindsight, Maddon-to-the-Cubs was pretty well ordained about 15 seconds from the time he opted out of his Tampa Bay contract.\n\nHonestly, I don't know whether this is a good or bad hire -- and you don't, either. The Twins have done so many things to antagonize their fans over the last couple of years that I understand if Molitor's hiring doesn't bring you any closer to Target Field for now. What I do know is that my interest is piqued about what will follow this winter -- and what will come of it next season. Molitor and the Twins won that battle on Tuesday.","677":"Is The Lindsay-Nicole-Paris Circus Getting A 2020 Reboot? Being in quarantine means reminiscing on simpler times. Thanks to a new single, magazine shoot, and Quibi show, that time is 2006.

The Cato Institute is calling on Congress to investigate whether the FBI is spying on it and other domestic political groups, after public records requests raised the possibility that the Bureau has files on Cato and others.\n\nPatrick Eddington, a research fellow at Cato, has submitted more than 200 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for FBI files on political advocacy groups, civil liberties organizations, think tanks, and publications across the political spectrum. For about two dozen of those requests so far, the FBI said it could neither confirm nor deny whether it had collected national security or foreign intelligence records. Those organizations include the Campaign for Liberty started by former Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas); a grassroots privacy-rights group called Restore the Fourth; the Cato Institute; and Reason Foundation, the nonprofit that publishes this magazine\n\nThe well-worn \"can neither confirm nor deny\" phrase is known as a \"Glomar response.\" The term originated in a 1975 FOIA lawsuit by a Rolling Stone journalist seeking CIA records on the Glomar Explorer, a salvage ship the spy agency used in an attempt to recover a sunken Soviet nuclear submarine. A federal judge ruled that the CIA could refuse to acknowledge the existence of such records if doing so would in and of itself compromise national security. The Glomar doctrine has since spread to other federal agencies and trickled down to state and local government entities as well.\n\nThe responses Eddington received don't prove that the FBI has collected intelligence on the above groups, but Eddington says that in the 45 years since the original court decision, he's not aware of a national security case where a Glomar response was defeated in court and revealed no government activity. \"We know for a fact that Glomar invocations have been used to conceal actual, ongoing activities,\" explains Eddington, a former CIA analyst, \"and we also know that they're not passing out Glomars like candy.\"\n\nThe FBI, which declined to comment for this story, has a long history of spying on dissident political groups, from early 20th century socialists and mid-century civil rights leaders to modern environmentalists and members of Black Lives Matter.\n\nFor Eddington, any such surveillance is inimical to freedom of speech. \"Any time [the FBI] is engaged in gathering that kind of data on news organizations or on domestic groups that are exercising their First Amendment rights, that activity should be expressly prohibited in the absence of a genuine criminal predicate,\" he says.","680":"It takes a village The team behind the John Coy\/Gaylord Schanilec picture book,\"My Mighty Journey: A Waterfall's Story\" has won this year's Minnesota Book Artist award.

Premiocre What do fake Eames chairs, extra legroom, and $40 scented candles have in common?\n\nTwo years ago, while trying to rent and furnish a new apartment, I was defeated repeatedly by the answer to the question How much could it possibly cost? Getting a key cost $3,200 when it required paying a broker fee to some guy named Steve. Four planks of wood and some metal piping cost $1,499 when they were a West Elm bookcase. I had moved and bought furniture before, of course, but the financial horror is fresh every time. This go-round, the kitchen chairs were what broke me.\n\nLike a lot of young people aspiring to move upward, I was in the market for some furniture crafted by Charles and Ray Eames, the mid-century designers who helped introduce modernism to the United States. The couple's work has been central to the furniture style's American revival in the past 20 years, but if you encounter high-end interior design mostly on Instagram and Pinterest, you probably know the Eameses by their chairs. The most famous pieces include a leather lounger-and-ottoman set with a curved wooden base that's particularly beloved by men who work at start-ups, as well as a series of dining chairs with colorful molded-plastic bucket seats. Arguably the most recognizable of the latter is nicknamed the \"Eiffel\" for its trussed-metal leg structure; one of the most popular reproductions costs $595 from Herman Miller, the design's original manufacturer. I needed at least four.\n\nNearly as quickly as the internet dashed my hopes of owning the coveted chairs, it came to my rescue -- by showing me the wares inside its coat. In the days after I'd spent a few minutes browsing for the real thing, ads on Instagram, Facebook, and Google offered up identical chairs at virtually every price level from discount decor retailers such as Wayfair and Overstock. I could pay $35, $60, or $100 each for chairs with no discernible differences from one another, or from the \"Eiffel\" they were legally aping (abetted by copyright and patent laws that make it difficult to protect design as intellectual property). Absent any real information about what I'd actually need to spend to end up with something decent to sit in, I was left to decide how much it was worth to me to announce to my visitors and Instagram followers that I'm also a mildly unimaginative person who appreciates Eames.\n\nRead: The new trophies of domesticity\n\nThe presence of many nice-enough choices without any meaningful way to distinguish among them is a fundamental dysphoria of modern consumerism. Anybody can track in intimate detail how the wealthy and stylish spend their money via social media, and just when you've learned exactly what you can't have, the internet swoops in to offer a look-for-less utopia of counterfeits, rip-offs, and discount cashmere sweaters, perfectly keyed to the performance of a lifestyle that young Americans desperately want but can't afford.\n\nIt was 2017, and Venkatesh Rao, a writer and management consultant, was having lunch at a fast-casual vegan chain restaurant in Seattle when the phrase premium mediocre popped into his head. It described the sensation he was having as he tucked into his meal -- one of a not-unpleasant artificial gloss (airline seating with extra legroom; \"healthy\" chickpea chips that taste like Doritos; $40 scented candles) on an otherwise thoroughly unspecial experience. I had a similar eureka moment in early 2018, when the portmanteau premiocre came to me while I was trying to parse the discriminating features among mid-priced bed linens from several start-up brands. I found Rao's observation while checking to see whether, against all odds, I had come up with an original idea. Instead, I'd noticed something that many others also saw wherever they looked, once they had heard the idea articulated.\n\nWhen Rao mentioned \"premium mediocre\" to his wife, who was eating with him that day, she immediately got it. So did his Facebook friends and Twitter followers. \"People had started noticing a pervasive pattern in everything from groceries to clothing, and entire styles of architecture in gentrifying neighborhoods,\" he told me. Premium mediocrity, by his definition, is a fancy tile backsplash in an apartment's tiny, nearly nonfunctional kitchen, or french fries doused in truffle oil, which contains no actual truffles. It's Uber Pool, which makes the luxury of being chauffeured around town financially accessible, yet requires that you brush thighs with strangers sharing the back seat.\n\nRao pegs the beginning of premium mediocrity's ascent to the 2008 financial collapse, when cupcakes ruled the culinary landscape. The cupcake is a classic example: It's a single-serve dessert on demand, minus the true indulgence of buying or making a whole cake to enjoy over time or share with family or friends. Cupcakes look great in photos, but as has been frequently noted in the past decade, many of them are not exactly delicious. I remain unconvinced that anyone ever took genuine pleasure in eating a dry, fist-size Crumbs Bake Shop cupcake topped with a mountain of hardened buttercream.\n\nAs with many aesthetically pleasing food trends that have thrived in the era of constant internet access, the value of a deluxe cupcake isn't necessarily in its physical consumption. Instead, it's more like an edible Gucci logo belt, or a sprinkle-topped boutique hotel with a beautifully decorated lobby bar and painfully cramped showers. These goods are the least expensive way to gain temporary entry to a particular consumer class -- for example, Gucci belts cost $450, while one of the brand's bags could easily set you back $3,500. The brand's belts are not any better at belting than many far less expensive options, but they provide a conduit for a person of middling means to transport herself into the lavish life she wants, if only within the highly edited confines of a carefully staged Instagram photo.\n\nCrumbs Bake Shop expanded to 79 locations in the United States before it went out of business in 2014, but the value system that enabled it remains: A plethora of subpar options is the foundation of modern shopping. Most Millennials were too young to get a foothold in the economy before it fell out from under them, and now, confronted with the precariousness of working- and middle-class life in the decade after the Great Recession, the most many can do is playact modern success for as long as possible while hoping the real thing happens eventually.\n\nAll of the faux-Eames chairs the internet tried to sell me are props for this Kabuki theater: things you buy because they're masquerading as more exceptional than they are. Some of these products are perfectly good at fulfilling their function, but they paper over a problem of class mobility that consumer choices can't change. The market has looked upon the people it serves and said, \"Let them eat cupcakes.\"\n\nSocial strivers have been buying knockoffs in America since modern consumerism took shape, in the decades after World War II. The advent of industrialized manufacturing and mass media helped create marketing as we know it, but it's hard to imagine that the internet would be so bloated with speciously opulent mid-priced home decor and personal-wellness products if not for celebrities and, more recently, Instagram.\n\nRao is right to date the acceleration of premium mediocrity to the late 2000s, but it wasn't just the recession that drove the phenomenon. The streets of Los Angeles and New York had turned into paparazzi wonderlands, fueled by a mixture of booming tabloid sales and new blockbuster gossip blogs such as TMZ. Photographers tailed Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, and Nicole Richie while they bought lattes and spilled out of nightclubs; then journalists and bloggers detailed exactly what they were wearing, carrying, and driving for a ravenous audience, often offering up \"looks for less\" to help readers imitate what they saw. This was the first time most Americans got such an exhaustive and unvarnished look at how famous people behave when they're not on the red carpet -- a glimpse of the wealth that had previously been consigned to the pages of glossy fashion magazines, where it was cleaned up and made tasteful, or to the personal knowledge of maids, cooks, and assistants.\n\nThe meteoric popularity of Instagram in the 2010s has meant that not only can the famous detail their favorite clothes, snacks, and skin-care lines for their fans, but so can the run-of-the-mill wealthy, who sometimes amass audiences in the six or seven figures. With that many followers, the random rich can charge brands to feature their stuff -- the upshot being that, absent a notable skill or expertise, a passel of ordinary and in many cases insipid people parlay family wealth or a remunerative marriage into a business all its own. For many of us, however, luxury is only creative artifice. In previous generations, fake it 'til you make it might have meant embellishing your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to land a stable corporate job with a pension. Now it means pairing a Gucci belt with a Zara wardrobe and hoping you're hot enough to eventually hawk teeth-whitening gadgets.\n\nEven if conspicuous consumption is a less-than-reliable career path, sometimes the look-for-less products we buy work great. And when they do, you feel like you're slipping through a tear in the fabric of capitalism. My $250 bookcase displays my books -- both in real life and in photographs -- just as well as the $1,499 one I balked at buying. I recently spent $35 on a viral hair gadget that makes my hair look professionally styled in a way that my $300 blow-dryer never has. It's intoxicating to believe for a moment that maybe rich people are the ones who have been getting conned all along, spending their money on cars and vacations and sweaters that aren't that much nicer than what regular people can afford.\n\nRead: I Gooped myself\n\nEvery time I dared to dream that I had somehow hacked taste in the year after I purchased the fake Eames chairs, the chairs quickly reminded me of my hubris. Money buys you plenty of advantages in a society built to reward its accumulation, and it almost certainly buys you chairs that don't need to be flipped over once a week to have their screws tightened. That's what I regularly did until a visiting friend tumbled out of one and onto the floor, at which point my embarrassment about my own premium mediocrity overtook the financial worries that had consigned me to it. I bought solid metal dining chairs, which were more expensive than my knockoffs but less likely to fail at their one job. In the end, the internet worked exactly as it's been designed to: I caved to the thrill of a deal that felt too good to be true, and when that turned out to be the case, I went back out to shop again.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

As he tells it, \"You have to be thankful to the audience...that people are requesting your services and you're being hired to do something.\" Camil burst onto the scene, for U.S. audiences at least, playing the gregarious and charming Rogelio de la Vega on five seasons of The CW's \"Jane the Virgin.\" Now, with \"Jane\" having concluded its run last year, Camil is transitioning to a new role as an actor and executive producer for the CBS multicamera sitcom, \"Broke.\"\n\n\"Broke,\" akin to classic sitcoms like \"Green Acres,\" follows struggling single mom Jackie (Pauley Perrette) and what happens when her once wealthy sister and brother-in-law (played by Natasha Leggero and Camil) come to live with her after going broke. Camil has deep connections to the property, which initially started out as a Colombian television production. Camil played the title role when it was remade in Mexico as \"Qu\u00e9 pobres tan ricos.\" It was only natural that the series would pop back up again during a discussion with \"Jane the Virgin\" showrunner Jennie Snyder Urman.\n\nInitially, the two were collaborating on a proposed spin-off series for his \"Jane\" character, Rogelio de la Vega, but Urman was drawn to Camil's previous discussion of the plot to \"Qu\u00e9 pobres tan ricos.\" Because Snyder had an overall deal with CBS, she suggested Camil pitch the Americanized reboot as a 30-minute sitcom.\n\n\"Because I'm from Mexico and I don't know how the Hollywood industry works, I said, 'Oh, yeah, sure!'\" Camil said. But the development process was difficult. \"If I knew that the odds are not in your favor, and how difficult it is to place a show on CBS in the multicamera format, I would have said no way!\"\n\nStruggles in production aside, \"Broke\" breaks a glass ceiling at CBS. Camil is the first Latino to lead a comedy series on the network since Desi Arnaz on \"I Love Lucy\" in 1951. Camil noted that \"it's crazy\" when that factoid is brought up.\n\n\"I should not be the second one,\" Camil said. \"There should have been more, but at least here we are.\"\n\nThough the actor can't fathom putting himself on the same pedestal as Arnaz, he does believe starring in \"Broke\" is indicative of studios pushing for greater inclusion.\n\nFer Pi\u00f1a\n\nWhen the show debuted during last year's up-fronts at Carnegie Hall \"every single president of a network [was saying] 'We are going to be more inclusive. We understand diversity; we embrace diversity,\" Camil said. For Camil, \"Broke\" being on such a widely-watched network on CBS means a greater proliferation of diversity. Lines are said in Spanish and Camil sees their inclusion as \"not a gimmick, but as a very organic and natural way include the language\" in a way similar to \"Jane the Virgin.\" It's definitely progress, since a 2017 look at the amount of shows starring Latinos illustrated progress, but none of those leads were on the Big Four broadcast networks.\n\nComedy has always been a verdant landscape for Latinos going back to the Cuban-born Desi Arnaz in \"I Love Lucy.\" The recent return of \"One Day at a Time\" on Pop TV also illustrates how Latinos are able to discuss important topics with enough levity to attract universal audiences. Camil doesn't think it's fair to compare the two series as \"each show lives in its own universe and they're very different from each other.\" He hopes that audiences who enjoy \"One Day at a Time\" will give \"Broke\" a chance.\n\nFor Camil, he's made his career in the United States playing comedy but has also dabbled in practically every other genre, from action to drama. Camil's Hollywood transition was certainly a slow one, despite him working in film and television for 27 years. However, Camil looks at everything on the bright side and believes all his choices have resulted in the amazing career he has now. When he initially traveled to Hollywood for the first time, he committed to living in Los Angeles for a year. \"I'm here two months and my dear friend Rosy O'Campo, the showrunner of my last four projects in Mexico, called me,\" he said. He initially turned O'Campo down but she convinced him to come back to work on the project which was the Mexican incarnation of \"Broke.\" \"If it wasn't for that I wouldn't have gotten in contact with 'Broke.'\"\n\nHis turn as Javier in \"Broke\" contains similar comedic elements to Rogelio de la Vega, but Camil isn't afraid of being typecast. \"It would be very dumb for me, and I will say for any actor, to walk away from something that gives so much joy and pleasure to the audience,\" he says. And with the continued need for grander representation in every genre of media the time is ripe for Camil to continue shattering the barriers that still exist. He may be the second Latino to lead a comedic series, but fingers are crossed he'll inspire many more.\n\n\"Broke\" airs on CBS April 2nd.","684":"James Johnson says Wolves have no 'fake gym rats' At 33, James Johnson has been around the NBA block a few times, and he can tell when a player is a hard worker and when one is not.

The challenges are judged by reactions to the online videos or by local \"judges.\"\n\nTwist is hopeful this motivates people to stay home.\n\nTwist said she struggled with physical distancing before she started focusing on creating these challenges.\n\n\"I'm always so used to being on the go and I was driving myself crazy because I had to stay home,\" she said.\n\nAs a mother of three, Twist understands the importance of distancing.\n\n\"I have twins who have asthma so I can imagine this would be hard on their little bodies,\" she said. \"It's scary that this thing is going around and you wouldn't know you have it.\"\n\nOn Sunday, James Smith Cree Nation Chief Wally Burns issued a notice confirming that a member had contracted COVID-19 and was isolating at home.\n\n\"We're taking all precautions in a safe manner dealing with the first case,\" Burns said Monday.\n\nHe said a local pandemic response team is working with health officials to \"identify the hotspots\" and trace the steps of the 40-something-year-old man who tested positive.\n\nBurns said the man had previously been in Saskatoon and Prince Albert. He was confirmed positive on Sunday, but Burns said the man self-isolated after he began feeling sick on March 27, the same day the community declared a state of emergency.\n\n\"This virus is not a joke, anyone can get it and you don't know where you'll get it,\" said the community member who tested positive in a video posted to Facebook. \"Please stay at home.\"\n\nBurns encouraged people not to panic even if their situation seems scary or overwhelming, as the pandemic response team is preparing for a scenario where COVID-19 does spread locally.\n\n\"We have a healing lodge in our community and we're going to be utilizing that for the isolation,\" he said.\n\nBurns has urged community members to follow the public health guidelines of distancing and hand-washing. He wants his members to know that they will eventually overcome COVID-19.\n\n\"You've just gotta be patient and make sure we're looking after one another.\"\n\nLast week, Saskatchewan NDP Leader Ryan Meili said a pandemic \"doesn't respect jurisdictional boundaries\" and called on the province to offer \"more support and protection\" for First Nations and M\u00e9tis people in the province.\n\n\"We know these communities are at higher risk, with crowded housing, elevated levels of poverty and higher rates of illness,\" Meili said Friday.\n\nThe NDP called on the province to increase testing in the north and on reserves, ensure health care workers have personal protective equipment and increase communication with First Nations and M\u00e9tis leaders. The party also raised concerns about food security in remote communities, noting a lack of resources means people have to travel frequently for necessities.\n\nPremier Scott Moe said last week he has had \"a number of conversations\" with First Nations Chiefs throughout Saskatchewan about \"safeguarding those communities and how we can work mutually to ensure that we are doing everything we can to prevent COVID-19 from entering.\"\n\nMoe said he expected more conversations to come in the days ahead.","686":"Javelin Thrower Shivpal Singh Becomes 2nd Indian After Neeraj Chopra To Qualify For Tokyo Olympics | Athletics News Indian javelin thrower Shivpal Singh has qualified for his maiden Olympic Games in Tokyo this year by breaching the qualification mark at an event. Shivpal became the second Indian javelin thrower after star athlete Neeraj Chopra to qualify for the Tokyo Olympics. The 24-year-old Shivpal crossed the qualifying standard of 85m by hurling the spear to a distance of 85.47m in his fifth attempt to win gold in the ACNW Meeting at the McArthur Stadium late on Tuesday.\n\n\"Shivpal Singh qualifies for #Olympics @Tokyo2020 with a performance of 85.47m in Men's Javelin in #SouthAfrica,\" the Athletics Federation of India tweeted.\n\nAnother Indian Akshdeep Singh finished third with a best throw of 75m. Four athletes took part in the event.\n\nChopra had qualified for the Tokyo Games with a throw of 87.86m at another ACNW League meeting in January.\n\nBoth of them are currently here for a training stint. Shivpal has a personal best of 86.23m while winning a silver medal in the Asia Championships in Doha last year.\n\nHe also took part in the prestigious Diamond League meeting in the Oslo leg (Norway) last year, finishing eighth with a throw of 80.87m.\n\nBesides Shivpal and Chopra, men's national record holder 20km race walker KT Irfan, Avinash Sable (men's 3000m steeplechase) and the country's mixed 4x400m relay team have qualified for the Tokyo Games.\n\nNational record holder Annu Rani also won the gold with a best throw of 61.15m in women's javelin throw in her first competition of the year.\n\nHer effort was, however, well below the Tokyo Olympics qualifying mark of 64m.","687":"Javier B\u00e1ez catches for Twins' starter Jos\u00e9 Berr\u00edos, looks like a natural By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy\n\nYou gotta think wherever Javier B\u00e1ez plays on defense, he's going to succeed. The Cubs infielder has emerged as one of the best shortstops in the game, but we've seen him flash the leather at second and third base time and time again.\n\nHeck, if the Cubs put B\u00e1ez in the outfield, it'd be unwise to bet against his ability to succeed. Based on one video, the same can probably be said about El Mago behind the plate.\n\nMLB Puerto Rico tweeted a video Monday of B\u00e1ez catching for Twins All-Star starter Jos\u00e9 Berr\u00edos, his brother-in-law. Unsurprisingly, B\u00e1ez - who played catcher in high school - looks like a natural.\n\nB\u00e1ez has never caught a big league game, but he was the Cubs' emergency catcher in 2016 when Kyle Schwarber was sidelined with a knee injury.\n\nThe Cubs will never put B\u00e1ez behind the dish due to the risk of injury, and there's a lot more to the position than catching and throwing.

Archer, on Monday, posted an image of the message he received on Instagram and said he could not understand why someone would make such comments. \"I (have) given a lot of thought about reacting to this and I hope no one else has to deal with stuff like this on a regular basis, it isn't ever acceptable and should be addressed properly in my opinion,\" he wrote in one of his Instagram stories.\n\n\"I will never understand how people feel so freely to say these things to another human being, it baffles me,\" he added.\n\nThis is not the first time that the 24-year-old, who helped England win the 2019 World Cup, has been subjected to racial abuse.\n\nHe was racially abused at the end of the first Test against New Zealand last November after he scored a second-innings 30 during England's defeat in Mount Maunganui.\n\nAfter the end of the match, Archer had tweeted: \"A bit disturbing hearing racial insults today while battling to help save my team. The crowd has been amazing this week except for that one guy.\"\n\nNew Zealand Cricket had taken action and in January, they had banned a 28-year-old man, who admitted the offence, from attending international and domestic games in the country for two years.\n\nThe right-arm pacer has been out of action since January with an elbow injury.","692":"John Cena's body transformation from 2018 to WrestleMania 36 is seriously impressive John Cena returned to WWE after 15 months away from the ring on Sunday night, facing off with 'The Fiend' Bray Wyatt at WrestleMania 36.\n\nThe 16-time world champion has been on hiatus since January 2019 and competed in a Firefly Fun House match, which many fans think stole the show.\n\nThere was very little actual wrestling and it was more of a cinematic experience, with The Fiend delving deep inside his opponent's mind to gain a psychological edge.\n\nIt began with Cena revisiting various eras of his career - including his Ruthless Aggression debut - and we even saw him as a member of NWO in WCW Monday Nitro.\n\nBizarre right?

He had asked for $4.4 million. Last season, Berrios earned $620,000 while winning 14 games.\n\nIf Berrios had won his case, it would have been a record for a contract awarded via arbitration to a first-year eligible pitcher. That contract still would have fallen well short of the $7.25 million contract Dallas Keuchel got with Houston in 2016, when the 2015 AL Cy Young Award winner reached agreement with the Astros before going to an arbitrator.\n\nOn Twitter, Berrios (@JOLaMaKina) thanked the Major League Baseball Players Association, which supported his quest for a record reward, and his agents, the Wasserman Media Group: \"Feels good to be well represented, but feels even better to have a dream team represent you! THIS IS MY DREAM TEAM! No matter what the final result is! Thank you @Wasserman, @mlbpa & everyone who was part of this for all the hard work and support!\"\n\nIf Berrios does not sign a long-term contract he will be eligible for free agency in 2023.\n\nThe Twins didn't go to arbitration with their other six eligible players. In January, first baseman Miguel Sano got a three-year bridge contract, with a fourth year option, that takes him through all his arb eligible seasons. That deal is guaranteed for $30 million and could be worth $41 million.\n\nOther arbitration-eligible players the Twins signed in January were:\n\n*\u202fByron Buxton, who will earn $3.075 million next season, a 75.7% increase over the $1.75 million the center fielder was paid in 2019.\n\n*\u202fReliever Tyler Duffey signed for $1.2 million, more than double the near-minimum salary he earned last summer.\n\n*\u202fCloser Taylor Rogers' pay will nearly triple to $4.45 million from 2018's $1.525 million.\n\n*\u202fOutfielder Eddie Rosario will receive $7.75 million, an 85% raise from his $4.19 million salary in 2019.\n\n*\u202fReliever Trevor May, who can become a free agent at the end of the 2020 season, will earn $2.205 million, a 145% increase from last year.\n\nAll five players quickly agreed to contracts at salaries between what the team proposed and what they asked for in arbitration, a practice that has long been relatively routine for the Twins.","694":"Judge Criticized Ron DeSantis Appointee and Ended Up Getting Suspended for 'Insubordination' Judge Criticized Ron DeSantis Appointee and Ended Up Getting Suspended for 'Insubordination'\n\nA subordinate judge who issued an opinion that was critical of his Gov. Ron DeSantis-appointed supervisor was sanctioned and suspended last Wednesday.\n\nAdministrative Law Judge (ALJ) John Van Laningham called out Division of Administrative Hearings Chief Judge and Director John MacIver in the footnotes of a decision. Van Laningham accused the DeSantis appointee of making improper \"ex parte communications\" in a case concerning a horse racing-and-betting track.\n\nThe supervising judge, MacIver, was strong-armed into office by the governor in February over the GOP-controlled Florida legislature's surprisingly strong disapproval.\n\n\"I've talked to a lot of folks in the process, and there are a couple of areas where there was some concern,\" said State Sen. Ed Hooper, a Republican. \"I just didn't have a level of comfort bringing that confirmation forward, because that has my name on it.\"\n\nReporting at the time suggests that MacIver's perceived deficiencies-and \"concern\" expressed by the Florida Senate-were his seven years' worth of time spent as a lawyer and his lack of courtroom experience. Other concerns, however, sprung up as well. Per an article in the Tampa Bay Times:\n\n[W]hat MacIver lacked in experience, he made up for in connections. Most of his time as a lawyer has been spent working for former Gov. Rick Scott or DeSantis, and he's a chapter president of the Federalist Society, whose conservative judicial philosophy is shared by DeSantis.\n\nDuring his interview with DeSantis and the Cabinet, MacIver raised eyebrows by repeating Federalist Society talking points and mentioning stripping away powers the administrative judges have held for decades.\n\nIn 2019, MacIver told DeSantis that his goal would be to hire \"the correct [Administrative Law Judges] who have the correct judicial philosophy,\" which he described as \"apolitical.\" At the time, MacIver led his local chapter of the Federalist Society, the most prominent and influential conservative legal organization in the country.\n\nDeSantis eventually appointed MacIver anyway.\n\nVan Laningham's footnotes cut to the quick of MacIver's own stated reason for being in charge of the obscure but powerful state agency.\n\nAccording to ALJ Van Laningham, MacIver began reviewing other judges' orders and commenting on them before they took effect-an extraordinary turn of events which suggests the Federalist Society's MacIver has made good on his promises.\n\nAccording to the Tampa Bay Times, MacIver has been engaged in such a review since he was appointed by DeSantis last October.\n\nALJ Van Laningham called attention to MacIver's comments by writing that they \"are, or might be, ex parte communications prohibited by\" Florida law. The legalese term \"ex parte\" is Latin for \"one-sided\" and generally refers to communications between a judge and only one party to a case or controversy.\n\nThe Florida law on point reads, in relevant part:\n\n34-17.016 Ex Parte Communications.\n\n(1) A Commission member shall not initiate nor consider any ex parte communication relative to the merits of a pending referral proceeding by:\n\n(a) A public employee or official engaged in prosecution or advocacy in connection with the matter;\n\n(b) A party to the proceeding or any person who, directly or indirectly, would have a substantial interest in the proposed action of the Commission, or his or her authorized representative or counsel; or\n\n(c) A referring agency or any other individual who has personal knowledge of the facts underlying the proceeding, or his or her authorized representative or counsel. Nothing in this subsection shall apply to advisory staff members who do not testify on behalf of the Commission in the proceeding or shall prohibit Commission members who are contacted by any of the above persons from referring them to Commission staff or the Commission Advocate.\n\nVan Laningham, the ALJ, added that he was simply \"erring on the side of caution\" by putting his criticism in the footnotes of the horse track decision and said \"any party desiring to rebut this communication shall be allowed to do so in accordance with\" the relevant statute.\n\nAfter that order was issued, however, Van Laningham was slapped with charges of \"insubordination and misconduct.\" His five-day suspension took effect last Wednesday. But the administrative law judge, a 20-year veteran known for his caustic orders, intends to fight the sanctions.\n\n\"[The department's] decidedly negative reaction to Judge Van Laningham's truthful disclosure of a public record in the interests of full transparency to the litigants is both puzzling and concerning,\" Van Laningham's attorney Daniel Bean wrote.\n\n\"It is highly concerning that [the department] appears to take the position that an [Administrative Law Judge] is prohibited from exercising his independent decision-making authority to analyze and interpret a statute and determine its applicability,\" Bean continued.\n\nAdministrative Law Judge Li Nelson, who co-authored the suspension recommendation, cast aspersions about Van Laningham's true motivations, doubting \"his assertion that he truly believed Judge MacIver's comments to be ex parte communications.\"\n\n\"There was no intent to attack the director's practice,\" said Jackie Van Laningham, the judge's daughter, an attorney who works for Bean, said in a statement. \"We'll move forward, but obviously our position is there was no misconduct or insubordination and no directive or order that was violated.\"","695":"Judge tosses convictions in case championed by Maya Moore Maya Moore has always been known for hitting the big shot on the grandest stage. She just got the biggest assist of her career.\n\nA judge on Monday overturned the 1997 burglary and assault convictions of a Missouri man, Jonathon Irons, whose case has been championed by the Lynx star to the point she stepped away from her career to help the family friend.\n\nCole County Judge Dan Green found the defense for Irons provided enough evidence to prove he was wrongfully convicted, a decision first reported by the Jefferson City News-Tribune. He has been serving a 50-year prison sentence stemming the non-fatal shooting of a homeowner in the St. Louis area when Irons was 16.\n\nMoore called Irons after Monday's court hearing. When he answered the phone, Moore and a group of supporters cheered to let him know the judge had ruled in his favor. Irons thanked his supporters and even broke into song at one point.\n\nSome 23 years after the incident, Irons could be freed within 30 days of the judge's order, unless the St. Charles County prosecutor's office decides to retry him. The judge also stayed his order pending a review by the Missouri attorney general's office, which could decide to appeal.\n\n\"It's a surreal feeling, it hasn't sunk in yet,\" Moore said in a telephone interview with the AP. \"It will when he walks out those doors. It's like we got to the Final Four, but still have some work left to do. I have mixed emotions as I'm elated it happened but the decision could have been made so much faster.\"\n\nThe Lynx star put her career on hold last season to help Irons. The four-time WNBA champion said last month she planned to sit out a second season and miss the Tokyo Olympics this summer. She told the AP those plans haven't changed despite the court ruling.\n\n\"'My decision to take another year was bigger than this case,\" she said. \"But obviously this case was in the forefront of my mind. I'm looking forward when this is done to finally getting some rest and time with my family.\"\n\nMoore was surrounded by friends and family when Irons called and she told him: \"You're coming home.\"\n\n\"He was over the moon praising hallelujahs and thanking the lords,\" she said.\n\nMoore, who was born in Jefferson City, Missouri, and a collegiate star at Connecticut, said all her success on the basketball court prepared her for the court case.\n\n\"My basketball experience helped me navigate this battle,\"she said. \"To have a long-term goal is like going through a season: you need to have poise and trust different teammates to do their job. A lot of the skills I've been able to display on the basketball court helped me have what I needed to navigate this taxing and emotional process.\"","696":"Jump Shot director Jacob Hamilton on why Kenny Sailors resonates with NBA All-Stars Director Jacob Hamilton tells FanSided about the man behind the jump shot and sharing early cuts with Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant.\n\nJump Shot tells the story of the man who invented the jump shot. Not a lot of people realize someone had to invent such a ubiquitous part of the game, but check the tape and yes, there is a before and an after and one man who brought the jump shot to the basketball court. That man is, most agree, Kenny Sailors.\n\nBut Sailors is more than the man who invented the jump shot, and that was the story director and documentarian Jacob Hamilton wanted to tell. Sailors lived a full life, as a player, teacher, man of faith, basketball coach and longtime advocate of the women's game. And it was these parts of Sailors story that resonated the most when Hamilton shared early cuts of the documentary with Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant. Both immediately wanted to be involved.\n\nLike most people, I had never heard the name Kenny Sailors. I originally came across his story back in June 2011 and immediately knew there was something special there. What initially piqued my interest was the idea that someone actually \"invented\" the jump shot. I did some research and quickly learned that not only was Kenny one of the early pioneers of the jump shot, but that he was still alive and living in Laramie, Wyoming.\n\nWhat was the most surprising thing you learned during your research?\n\nWhile discussing the possibility of his participation in the documentary he told me, \"All people want to do is discuss my jump shot and basketball. There are plenty of other things that I have done in my life that I am more proud of. I was a coach, high school teacher, big game guide and outfitter, a father, husband, marine, and a man of faith.\" My response to his statement was, \"Kenny, this is the film I want to make!\"\n\nKenny played an instrumental role in developing, pioneering, and popularizing what we now know as the modern-day jump shot. Something we take for granted every time a high school kid, a college athlete, or NBA\/WNBA player steps on the court. The jump shot is the primary offensive weapon of the modern game. Kenny is a man who defined the game, but when you sit down and have a real conversation with him, you'll quickly conclude that the game never defined who he was. In a world driven by social media, selfies, and \"look at me\" culture, there was something admirable and so refreshing about Kenny to me.\n\nHow did you decide how to balance Jump Shot as a story of Kenny's life vs. Jump Shot as a story of the invention of the jump shot? In other words, how did you decide how much of Kenny's life to cover in the documentary?\n\nA vast majority of documentaries that are featuring a story of the past rely heavily upon archival material. This is something that always limits a filmmaker. And while there's nothing wrong with this approach, I have always been more drawn to documentaries that are more character driven. A good portion of Kenny's story and the origin of the jump shot take place in the past, but I wanted to weave in the past with the present. Access to capture Kenny living today provided us with the opportunity to make a more dynamic and compelling film. Instead of the film telling the audience his story, we could let the audience experience Kenny's stories for themselves.\n\nThere's no shortage of stories we could have shared about Kenny's life. There were several scenes and stories that we left on the cutting room floor because we didn't have enough archival material to support the story or it interrupted the pacing of the overall film we were trying to tell. Every scene, basketball or non-basketball is intentional and helps develop Kenny's character and propel the story forward.\n\nHow did Steph Curry, Kevin Durant and Dirk Nowitzki get involved?\n\nEach one of these guys came to the project in different ways. A close friend of ours happens to be the Chaplain for USA Basketball (Coach Mo). He, Steph, and KD have formed a close relationship through their years with USA Basketball. We were fortunate enough to share an early version of the film with Steph and his team at Unanimous Media. We hoped that \"maybe\" we could interview Steph for the film, but we weren't expecting Steph to ask us how he could be more involved with the film beyond the interview! Obviously, Steph connected with the film because of his love for basketball, but it was Kenny and what Kenny stood for i.e. his love for family, God, and how he was a champion for women's basketball, etc. that most attracted Steph to the film. These conversations led Steph to become an executive producer.\n\nI was able to take a rough cut of the film to KD's house with Coach Mo and two of my producers. It was an incredible moment for our team. We were nervous, as this was a rough cut of the film with no modern players involved, but we were confident in the story and how well it would line up with KD's character. Something special happened that night in the Oakland hills. KD fell in love with Kenny, as there are very similar life moments that they both share. There were instances where KD would scrub back and forth in the film watching Kenny on the court, replaying how he moved, and talking about how these are things he was trying to do! After the film ended, KD stood up and said, \"All right guys, what do I need to do to be a part of this? It's beautiful!\" We were all in tears. There is something about Kenny Sailors that moves in your soul. Again, Kenny brought people together.\n\nDo you have any standout stories about filming with those players or the experience of introducing them to the story of Kenny?\n\nGetting to introduce Kenny's story to these legends was an absolute dream. I never really thought we'd have these opportunities laid out in front of us, but that's the exciting part about making documentaries... the discovery.\n\nFor me, the biggest shock was getting to share the film with both Steph and Kevin. They were so moved by Kenny's life and recognized the importance of getting his story out there, upon the film's completion each one of them asked us how they could help. It blew our minds!\n\nWhere does the campaign to get Kenny into the Hall of Fame stand today?\n\nIt's tough to say. The rules of how one is selected into the Hall of Fame seem to change regularly. I'd like to hope that the selection process will continue to take shape and create more opportunities for pioneers, like Kenny, to be recognized for their contributions to the game. I think creating a more transparent selection process similar to the Baseball Hall of Fame would be a huge win. As far as I'm aware, Kenny is on the ballot this year, but having played so long ago it's a challenge to find people to be a voice for him. Now that we've been able to introduce Kenny's story to some powerful names in the basketball world, we hope their voices and influence help turn the tide.\n\nAre there any other unsung basketball legends whose stories you're interested in telling?\n\nThere absolutely are! I'm not sure what's next for me. I love living in the sports world, but I might look outside the sport of basketball on the next project. I hope to circle back around someday to basketball, but it'll be nice to shake things up and do something a little different.","697":"Jupiter's Storm Is a Sunburn? The ruddy color of Jupiter's Great Red Spot is likely a product of simple chemicals being broken apart by sunlight in the planet's upper atmosphere, according to a new analysis of data from NASA's Cassini mission. The results contradict the other leading theory for the origin of the spot's striking color -- that the reddish chemicals come from beneath\n\nThe results are being presented this week by Kevin Baines, a Cassini team scientist based at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, at the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Science Meeting in Tucson, Arizona.","698":"Jury finds Washington County deputy Brian Krook not guilty of manslaughter in shooting death of armed and suicidal man Washington County's Brian Krook acted reasonably, jurors find.\n\nA Washington County jury on Thursday acquitted deputy Brian Krook of second-degree manslaughter in the shooting death of an armed and suicidal man in 2018, returning its verdict only a day after hearing closing arguments in the case.\n\nThe jury sided with the defense's version of Krook as a hero who was \"stone cold innocent\" in Lake Elmo on the night of April 12, 2018, when the deputy confronted and then fatally shot -- without warning -- 23-year-old Benjamin Evans, a Lake Elmo firefighter upset about an ex-girlfriend, after lengthy negotiations.\n\nJury foreperson Susan Strandlof said she didn't want to elaborate on the trial or the verdict. \"It was a just verdict,\" she said.\n\nBut Evans' parents said they were devastated by the verdict, believing for the past two years that there would be justice for their son's death. The evidence speaks for itself, said his mother, Kim Porter.\n\n\"We believed that Mr. Krook was most certainly guilty of the crime of murdering our son,\" she said.\n\nThe jury made its decision after asking Thursday morning to review videos of the incident, including an enhanced version prepared by the prosecution that more clearly depicted Evans.\n\nThe videos were shown several times at trial, and the enhanced video, said Krook's attorney, Kevin Short, very clearly shows \"exactly what our client saw and perceived\" -- that Evans pointed his handgun at officers.\n\nKrook's trial was the third in recent memory in which a Minnesota law enforcement officer faced criminal charges for an on-duty shooting. Short said he believed the grand jury indicted Krook because of the way the case was presented, including expert testimony that Short said the defense impeached at trial.\n\n\"One of their experts said, said incredulously, this man, this young man, with this gun presented a risk of danger only to himself and to no one else. A categorically absurd statement,\" said Short.\n\nSpeaking for Krook, Short said his client was \"profoundly appreciative of what this jury has done from beginning to end in undertaking this service.\"\n\nKrook, who has been on paid leave since his indictment, can now return to work.\n\nThe trial, which opened last week, hinged on the question of Krook's perception of danger: Was he justified in shooting a man who was kneeling in a public street while pointing a handgun at his right temple and negotiating with another Washington County deputy?\n\nEven though he held the gun to his head, Evans also was pointing it at the deputies when he turned his head and torso from side to side. Krook, in the minutes before firing, noted the movement to another deputy: \"Ramirez, I'm getting uncomfortable with him turning his head, just so you know.\"\n\nKrook fired two volleys of shots at Evans, the first while Evans was kneeling and the second about 20 seconds later. Krook and other deputies had rushed to the fallen Evans and were standing within a few feet of him when Evans, who was still holding the gun to his head while lying on his side, dropped his arm to the street. He was still holding the gun and its barrel pointed at the deputies again as his arm moved.\n\nShort said the key evidence in Krook's defense was the video that showed Evans' final moments. Evans refused at least 50 commands to drop his handgun during his 39-minute encounter with police.\n\nEvans' mother said she felt that the law enforcement community banded together to protect Krook and that the prosecution was right to accuse three of Krook's colleagues of perjury when they said in court that they felt threatened by Evans.\n\nThose statements, Prosecutor Thomas Hatch argued, conflicted with what the deputies told the grand jury months earlier.\n\nShort said after the jury's verdict was reached that he took \"great umbrage\" at the perjury accusations. The officers' statements to the grand jury were taken out of context by the prosecution, he said.\n\nWashington County Sheriff Dan Starry said he was proud of his deputies and called for public healing after a difficult trial.\n\n\"The loss of life in any call we respond to is never the desired outcome, though I am glad that we have courageous men and women that are willing to put their lives on the line every day to protect our citizens,\" he said.\n\nBrian Peters, executive director of the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association, called it \"unconscionable\" that prosecutors put Krook on trial \"for making a difficult decision, based 100 percent on his training.\" Sean Gormley, executive director of Law Enforcement Labor Services, the state's largest law enforcement union, agreed.\n\n\"This was a terrible tragedy for the family and friends of Benjamin Evans -- and extremely traumatic for the responding officers,\" Gormley said. \"We need to stop trying to make criminals out of police officers who are asked to respond to dangerous, no-win situations involving persons who don't put down their guns.\"\n\nEvans had never had a mental breakdown like the one he had the night he died, his parents said.\n\n\"Never. That was one of the things that shocked us when we got the phone call,\" said his father, Bill Evans. \"We were like 'What do you mean? You've got to be kidding.'\u2009\"\n\nBill Evans, a retired firefighter from the West St. Louis County (Mo.) Fire Department, said Benjamin worked for several years as a firefighter in Missouri before moving less than a block from the Lake Elmo Fire Department, where he hoped to eventually get hired full time. He left behind a 3-year-old daughter.\n\nBenjamin Evans grew up in the first responder culture. According to his parents, he spent his first Christmas at the fire station with his dad when he was just 5 weeks old and was riding on fire trucks after joining the Explorers at 14.\n\nA hockey injury just before Benjamin's senior year in high school in suburban St. Louis wrecked his chances of joining the Marines, and he was in basic training for the U.S. Air Force when he wrecked his knee. His parents said he pursued a firefighting and EMT work out of a dedication to public service.\n\n\"He lived to serve in any capacity that he could,\" Porter said.\n\nBill Evans said he worked thousands of calls with police officers and responded to many people threatening suicide. He said things could have ended differently for his son if deputies had given him just a bit more time.\n\n\"We all run into situations in our life where we find it very, very difficult and need some help,\" said Evans. \"The part that hurts the most for me, I've done thousands and thousands of calls, and the one time that I needed the service for the first responders to step up for my child, they let him down. They failed him.\"","699":"Kansas City-St. Joseph adds priest's name to abuser list KANSAS CITY, Mo.

Meanwhile, Jake Layman has been cleared to practice following assessments from multiple foot specialists.\n\nLayman has been out since tearing a ligament in his toe in a game Nov. 18 against Utah. He has missed the last 39 games since.

He finished with 21.\n\n\"It felt good,\" Martin said. \"Just going out there, playing free. Just playing free. Just playing my game the same way I play in the G-League.

Basketball has taken care of a lot of people's lives. When you get this opportunity, you want to go out there and have fun, be aggressive.\"\n\nBoth took that to heart on Sunday. Their future with the team is up in the air past this season since they are on two-way deals, but both have been making the case to get permanent NBA deals. Perhaps that hunger to prove themselves is contributing to their play.\n\n\"You're able to see it. It's very noticeable,\" said their frequent Iowa teammate Naz Reid. \"They want to be noticed and they're putting their foot on people's necks as people say. I just want them to keep doing the things they're doing.\"\n\nWith the Wolves in full-on evaluation mode, they should get the opportunity to prove themselves more over the next two months, so long as they don't go over their 45 allotted days with the NBA squad.\n\n\"It's a different set of travel circumstances, games, a lot of things [in Iowa],\" coach Ryan Saunders said. \"When you get around the NBA club, I know those guys appreciate being here, playing in these games and competing and so they come in with a great mindset, great attitude and great intensity and it does rub off on the group.\"","703":"Kenny Rogers: The Photographer | Fstoppers If you have an ear for music or you're tuned into pop culture, you're likely aware that Kenny Rogers passed away last week. Did you know that he was also an avid photographer? Did you know that Rogers was inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum?\n\nTo be clear and upfront, I'm a big fan of Rogers' troubadour-like approach to performance. His music spins in our house at least once a week. Surprisingly, I wasn't aware of his passion for photography.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nI can't begin to wrap my head around this, but last Friday was the 40th anniversary of the release of #TheGambler as a single! I remember the b-side on the 45 was \"Momma's Waiting.\" I had no idea at the time what this song or THE GAMBLER album release (to come a few weeks later) would do for my career, but I am forever grateful to Don Schlitz for writing a song I never get tired of singing!\n\nA post shared by Kenny Rogers (@_kennyrogers) on Nov 18, 2018 at 10:20am PST\n\nIn an interview with Billboard Magazine, Rogers said:\n\nI've never considered myself a great singer, but I am a great storyteller.\n\nRogers didn't just tell stories with his songs; he told them with his camera as well.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nThe #photographer Kenny Rogers.\n\nA post shared by Kenny Rogers (@_kennyrogers) on Mar 12, 2016 at 3:30pm PST\n\nI don't want you to dismiss this as one more celebrity who picked up a camera without investing themselves. Don't ignore this as one more celebrity who used their fame and access to take snapshots of their equally famous friends. If you did that, you'd be wrong. Take a look.\n\nRogers was fond of saying that while he was on the road 24\/7, week in and week out, he'd have hours to explore the highways and byways of America.\n\nEventually, he started to do his exploring with a camera -- singing version of Robert Frank, if you will.\n\nI found out that I only worked an hour a day. I'd go out at night, and I'd do my show, and I'd have 23 hours and nothing to do. So, we'd get up in the morning and get in the car, and Gene, my road manager, and I, we'd drive around...\n\nRogers studied photography with the likes of George Hurrell, Yousuf Karsh (one of the most highly regarded portrait photographers of all time, just in case you're looking for credentials), and John Sexton (a lauded landscape photographer who was once Ansel Adams' assistant, if you're still looking for credentials).\n\nThrough dozens of interviews, Rogers was happy to share the lessons he learned from these masters.\n\nKarsh told me how to capture the personality of a celebrity. You talk to them, make them feel at ease. Keep your eye on their eyes, and keep your hand on the shutter release. When you see them totally relaxed, that's when you shoot.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nRemembering the legendary Little Jimmy Dickens on his birthday.

I think that is good advice for all photographers.\n\nKenny Rogers' The Thumb.\n\nRogers was a student of Adams' techniques and often spoke about using his Zone System. In particular, he often noted that this, one of his favorite images, was a product of the Zone System.

It means they are not posing, but rather being who they truly are. It's honestly such a great trick.\n\nI think that Rogers' story about how he managed to capture Ray Charles in such a unique and honest way is my favorite of all the stories being retold this past week. It reminds me of Karsh and Churchill or Avedon and Prince Edward and Wallis Simpson. Portrait photography at its peak.\n\nI told Ray that I wanted to shoot photos of him while he was in motion going back and forth to capture that famous sway, and Ray said he couldn't do that on command, so I told him a dirty joke, and that's what I got.\n\nKenny Rogers' Ray Charles.\n\nRogers also had several photography monographs published over his lifetime.\n\nKenny Rogers - This Is My Country\n\nCover image of Kenny Rogers' This Is My Country, Amazon.\n\nYour Friends and Mine\n\nKenny Rogers' America\n\nCover image of Kenny Rogers' America, Amazon.\n\nKenny Rogers: American Beauty\n\nCover image of Kenny Rogers' American Beauty, Amazon.\n\nI want to leave you with one last quote from Rogers talking about the difference between a photograph and art. It seems, at least to me, to sit well with most of what is discussed in the comments here at Fstoppers.\n\nI think art, if you're capable of one art, you understand -- you know, the difference between a snapshot and a photograph is where you take it from. A snapshot of the Golden Gate Bridge is wonderful, but if you're a photographer you get down on the side and you find a way to give it some lines, and some movement, and that's the difference.\n\nKenny Rogers' Lincoln Memorial.\n\nAll images used with permission or embedded from Rogers' IG account or Amazon.\n\nThank you, SKH Music, Rogers' publicists.","704":"Kevin James goes to Vegas, forgets to pack the comedy in 'Paul Blart 2' Video (02:33) : In this sequel, Paul Blart, the security guard, is headed to Las Vegas.\n\nA recent public service announcement reminds residents of drought-plagued California not to waste precious resources by leaving the water running while they're brushing their teeth. But who's going to speak out against the flagrant and wanton misuse of talented comedians in \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2?\"\n\nI've given up hope on Kevin James, who long ago made a devil's bargain with the soul-crushing destroyers of cinema at Adam Sandler's Happy Madison shingle, but why did he have to drag down Ana Gasteyer and Loni Love, two exceptionally funny women wasted here in nothing roles and shaming wigs? And how could Nick Bakay, whose extensive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 includes Joel Hodgson's innovative and hilarious \"The TV Wheel,\" share a screenplay credit (with James, of course) on a movie whose chuckles (six, I counted) are outnumbered by helicopter shots of the Wynn resort in Las Vegas?\n\nSee video: Kevin James Tackles Sin City in 'Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2' Trailer (Video)\n\n(Incidentally, having sat through \"The Hangover,\" \"Last Vegas,\" \"21,\" \"Think Like a Man Too\" and more Vegas movies than I care to count, I hereby challenge filmmakers to create an establishing shot of the city's skyline that doesn't look like it was distributed to every production by the Convention & Visitors Authority.)\n\nPaul Blart -- imagine Inspector Clouseau, only husky, not French, and not funny -- tells us in the opening narration that the triumphs of the previous movie were short-lived; his wife left him after six days of marriage, and his beloved mother was soon thereafter hit by a milk truck. (Actresses Jayma Mays and Shirley Knight had the good sense to flee this movie in the first five minutes, a strategy audience members would be wise to emulate.)\n\nHis spirits are lifted by an invitation to Las Vegas for a convention of security officers, and he sets out to Sin City with daughter Maya (Raini Rodriguez, \"Austin & Ally\") in tow. After all the personal losses her dad has suffered, she's hesitant to tell him that she just got into UCLA, all the way across the country from their home in New Jersey.\n\nAlso Read: 'Unfriended' Scares Up $656,000, 'Paul Blart 2' Rolls to $450,000 at Thursday Night Box Office\n\nUnbeknownst to the blustery, bumbling Blart, the Wynn hotel where the convention is happening is also hosting Vincent (Neal McDonough, sleepwalking through yet another bad-guy role), who is planning to steal the casino's art treasures, including van Gogh's \"Sunflowers.\"\n\nThese two storylines, plus some interplay with Blart's fellow rent-a-cops, all of whom are condescendingly portrayed for maximum freakishness, somehow fill up 94 minutes at the hand of director Andy Fickman, who previously anointed the world with \"Parental Guidance\" and \"You Again.\"\n\nAlso Read: Kevin James and 'Paul Blart' Hope 'Furious 7' Runs Out of Gas at Box Office\n\nThe closest \"Paul Blart 2\" gets to actual comedy is in its use of James (and some strategic stunt doubles) somersaulting and flipping around despite his apparent ungainliness, but even that joke gets trotted out so often that it loses whatever impact it might have had. I watched the film with a paying, opening-night audience (Sony was happy to slap its name on almost every cell phone and watch featured in the movie, but they didn't want to share this film with critics in advance), and the place was mostly silent as a tomb, save for the featured-in-the-trailer gag in which Blart runs smack into a plate glass window.\n\nThe humor level in the film is so moribund that it doesn't even inspire groans or eye-rolling; instead, it figuratively puts its hands on your shoulders and pushes you deeper into your theater seat until you've been completely subdued by all the nothingness it has to offer. Cinematically speaking, it's like having a riot squad beanbag shot directly at your solar plexus.","705":"Khalil Mack, Julius Peppers Picked For NFL 2010s All-Decade Team Current Bears linebacker Khalil Mack arrived in Chicago with an impressive resume that he continued to build upon. In 2014, the Oakland Raiders selected the 6'3'' 269-pound linebacker out of the State University of New York at Buffalo with the fifth overall pick. He quickly became one of the NFL's fiercest defenders, piling up 40.5 sacks and 304 tackles in four seasons and winning the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award in 2016. The Bears traded for Mack before the 2018 season, signing him to a six-year $141 million deal, the richest to date for an NFL defender. He's tallied 21 sacks and 94 tackles over two seasons for the stronger Chicago defense. Mack has been selected to five straight Pro Bowls.\n\nJulius Peppers' career spanned most of the last two decades. The Carolina Panthers drafted the 6'7'' 295-pound defensive end in the 2002 NFL Draft with the second pick of the first round. By the time the Bears signed him to a six-year $91.5 million contract in 2010, Peppers was already a member of the 2000s NFL All-Decade Team and still among the NFL's premiere pass rushers. He would continue to excel in Chicago, picking up 37.5 sacks, 175 tackles and three Pro Bowl nods in his four years with the team, all while never missing a regular-season game. The Bears released Peppers after the 2013 season, but the aging defender remained a productive and durable pass rusher. In three seasons with the Green Bay Packers and two more with the Panthers, he collected 41 more sacks.\n\nDevin Hester, the Bears' second-round pick out of Miami in 2006, arrived in town as a cornerback but made his presence felt as a return specialist. Opposing teams quickly learned to kick away from Hester, who returned three punts and two kickoffs for touchdowns in his rookie season. Hester's success in the return game continued well into the 2010s.\n\nCordarrelle Patterson secured his reputation as a dangerous return man with the Minnesota Vikings. In 2013, in his second NFL game, the wide receiver out of Tennessee retuned the opening kickoff 105 yards against the Bears. In Week 8, this time against the Green Bay Packers, Patterson returned the opening kickoff 109 yards. The latter set an NFL record for the longest play that can never be broken. Patterson joined the Bears for the 2019 season, averaging 29.5 yards on his 28 kick returns, one of which went 102 yards for a touchdown.\n\nThe selection committee first started picking all-decade teams in 1969 to celebrate the NFL's 50th season.

However, the virus occurred less often than in adults.\n\nThe Australian reports the data, which examined about 150,000 laboratory confirmed US cases in adults and children from February 12 through April 2, mostly echo reports from China about how COVID-19 affects children.\n\nOf the 150,000 laboratory confirmed US cases, 2500 of them - about 2 per cent - were children, it said.\n\nWhile most children did not become severely ill, three have died.\n\nThe Australian reports cases were more common in older children and teens but serious illness appeared to be more common in infants.\n\nCases were also slightly more common in boys than girls.\n\nThe authors cautioned many details were missing from paediatric cases so the report should be considered preliminary.\n\nCDC's report stated the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms which clear up in a few weeks for most people.\n\nHowever, for some - especially older adults and people with existing health problems - it can cause more severe illness including life-threatening pneumonia.\n\nTo date, there have been 1.3 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide and 70,000 deaths.\n\nOf those cases, the US tops the charts with 340,000 reported infections and more than 10,000 deaths.\n\nThe Australian reports the authors stressed \"social distancing and everyday preventive measures\" were recommended for all ages, as people without symptoms, including children, were likely playing a role in transmitting the virus.\n\nThe findings come just days after doctors urged parents not to be alarmed by overseas reports of children dying of COVID-19, stressing it remains an absolute rarity - despite at least one Australian baby having to be hospitalised with the virus.\n\nIn the past two weeks, an infant aged under 12 months died in the US, as did a 12-year-old girl in Belgium and a reportedly otherwise healthy 13-year-old boy in the UK.\n\nSince the beginning of the outbreak, reports have stated the virus seems to affect older people the most and many young people who test positive experience only mild symptoms or none at all.\n\nSA Health confirmed one eight-month-old baby who tested positive for COVID-19 had been hospitalised but since discharged.\n\nOther state health departments were asked if any people with the virus aged under 20 had been admitted to hospital but they had either not replied or were unable to supply data at the time of going to press.\n\n\"The vast majority of young people who have tested positive have no symptoms, or trivial symptoms,\" University of Melbourne epidemiologist Professor John Mathews told News Corp.\n\n\"Clearly young people have less severe infections and we think - although we can't prove it at the moment - they probably transmit less virus to other people.\"\n\nProf Mathews said it was unclear why some children who tested positive for COVID-19 were getting sick when the majority remained asymptomatic.\n\n\"Every biological rule you can think of, there are always exceptions,\" he said.\n\n\"But the reassuring thing for children at the moment is they're very unlikely to get ill, and even if they do get ill, the chances of a severe infection or even death is very low.\"\n\nChildren tended to have less severe infections than adults because of \"innate community\", which diminished as people got older, Prof Mathews said.","709":"Kids coming back from college full of learnin' and COVID Ting!

Sure, she wanted to get out of the house, live on her own, and for some reason \"setting up residence in the garden shed\" didn't appeal.\n\nTing! So this happened. Lol.\n\nShe sent a screenshot of a message from the college saying they were switching to online-only classes for a month, due to the Current Situation. It says that if you were away on break, keep your filthy germ-ridden self where you were. (I'm paraphrasing.)\n\nWith all the classes online, there was no reason for her to sit in her dorm. She wanted to wait out the situation at home, and these were happy words to read.\n\nOf course! Come home. You'll have to stay in your room with plastic over the door and we'll push meals through the crack between the door and the floor, but, hey, that means lots of pizza.\n\nTing! WHAT\n\nI've ticked over into that demographic where the disease can be really bad, and you're coming from a place with lots of confirmed cases, so if you could Uber from the airport and take a quick dip in the big vat of bleach in the garage before going upstairs, that would be great. Your mom is still in the low-mortality demographic, so she'll give you a hug for both of us.\n\nI was kidding, of course, but not entirely so. I told her to get airline reservations immediately, because I imagined the airport would be like the scene in \"Casablanca\" when everyone's trying to flee Paris as the Nazis approach. (And while we're on the subject, it always made me a bit nervous when Rick took so long saying goodbye to Ilsa. It's the last ride out before Nazis. Give her a quick peck on the lips, and get on board.)\n\nAnyway. There still were flights, so all was good. But here's the thing: The college insists that the students will get all the necessary instruction online. But the parent who is writing the checks thinks: If this is a perfectly acceptable substitute, why do we have to send our kids off to distant cities to attend expensive institutions with big ivy-covered buildings? You're telling me that one can learn things outside of the traditional campus environment? No!\n\nOf course, there's more to college than that. There's the hothouse atmosphere of intellectual inquiry, as opposed to being at home where I walk around wearing a hat that has two beer cans attached to the side with straws, singing the \"Hee-Haw\" theme. I get that. But I decided to text the university to ask a reasonable question: Because you've turned into YouTube, is there any chance of a rebate?","710":"Kids sale: Save big on clothing and more at top children's retailers -- Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed's editors.

If the Olympics had happened this year as scheduled, we wouldn't have got one, since a coach for three to four months wouldn't make sense. Now, BAI might get one to help us.\"\n\nFlandy played a big part in helping Chirag-Satwiksairaj break into the world's top 10 last year, courtesy of their Thailand Open victory and a semi-final run at the French Open.\n\nBut Satwiksairaj admitted they wouldn't have made it to this stage without Kim Her, either.\n\nFollowing their remarkable triumph over 2018 world champions Li Junhui-Liu Yuchen in the Thailand Open final, Satwiksairaj paid tribute to Kim Her.\n\nIn an interview with The New Indian Express then, Satwiksairaj recounted how Kim Her turned him and Chirag from enemies to friends.\n\n\"We had different partners. We played against each other and did not like each other at all, \" said Satwiksairaj.\n\n\"So when Tan (Kim Her) brought us together, it was quite weird. Chirag is from a big city (Mumbai), I am from a small town in Andhra Pradesh.\n\n\"There was a big communication gap. Tan brought in the comfort that is required for partners to gel together. He taught us how to communicate with each other.\"\n\nChirag chipped in: \"Only two months into our partnership, Tan told us that in two years we would be in the top 30. I didn't believe it, but it happened.\n\n\"I would have been content just playing these top-level tournaments. To win is something that I have still to come to terms with. All credit goes to Tan as coach. He was compassionate and paid special attention to us.\"\n\nChirag-Satwiksairaj were the world No. 20 when Kim Her bade farewell to the BAI.\n\nOne of their notable achievements under Kim Her was winning silver at the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games, making them the first-ever Indian medal winners in the event.","712":"Kitchen range hoods are for all kitchens, not just above gas ovens Every home should be equipped with a ducted kitchen range hood. I've always known that it's a good idea to have an exhaust fan in the kitchen when cooking with gas stoves, but gas stoves aren't the only offender. Any cooking appliance in a home, gas or electric, will introduce pollutants into the air that are bad for you. I recently read a great 31-page white paper on ducted range hoods, and this blog post is the CliffNotes version of that information.\n\nA ducted range hood is a one-trick pony; it's a device dedicated to removing pollutants from the home while cooking. Re-circulating range hoods that blow air back into the home are nearly useless.\n\nAlso, a ducted range hood is not a combination microwave\/hood fan that exhausts to the exterior.\n\nWhile better than nothing, a combination microwave\/hood fan that vents to the exterior is not as effective as a dedicated range hood. Currently, no microwave range hoods comply with ASHRAE Standard 62.2-2016 for airflow or noise. This doesn't mean they can't be used... but they're not the best option.\n\nThe louder a range hood, the less likely people are to use it. The quieter the better. Look for a fan with a sone rating of 3 or less while operating at 200 cubic feet per minute (CFM) or higher. This is quiet enough to not drown out a normal conversation.\n\nThe job of a range hood is to remove pollutants from the air. The most effective range hoods are the ones that allow the least amount of pollutants to escape into the air. A well-designed range hood will have the following characteristics:\n\nI said bigger is better, but I'm referring to the footprint of the hood, not the size of the fan. With all things being equal, a higher CFM fan will outperform a lower CFM fan, but you don't want to go nuts. If you use a fan that's too large, you'll have an energy penalty to pay. For every cubic foot of air that's removed from a home, a cubic foot of outdoor air comes back in. This is no big deal when it's nice outside, but when it's hot or cold outside, the heating or cooling system in your home will have to work harder when the kitchen fan runs.\n\nEven more importantly, however, is the potential safety issue that an oversized kitchen hood fan can create. When you have a ton of air getting sucked out of the home that has to be replaced, where does the replacement air come from? It should come in through a makeup air duct, which is typically the same thing as a combustion air duct, but not always.\n\nWhen kitchen hood fans get especially large, the building code may require an oversized make-up air duct with a motorized fan to force makeup air into the home, and some of these systems may have duct heaters as well. As I'm sitting here writing about this, it sounds ludicrous to me, but I've seen it done on many homes. It's just good building science. Check out Makeup Air for Tight Houses for more on that topic.\n\nWhen there isn't enough makeup air brought into the home, the big bully kitchen fan will steal air from something else in the home. The obvious, feeble choice would be a natural-draft water heater vent, which simply relies on the buoyancy of hot exhaust gases to get the flue gas up and out of the home.\n\nWhen the kitchen fan wins that battle, you have a serious safety issue in the home. The fix is to make sure the water heater and kitchen fan never have to compete for air. This is done by using an appropriately sized passive duct or powered makeup air in some cases.\n\nHere in Minnesota, we have a complicated formula to calculate makeup air. I blogged about this back in 2013, and not much has changed since. Check out my blog post on that topic for more info: How to Determine if Makeup Air is Required and the 300 CFM Myth.\n\nFor people in other parts of the country that use a less amended version of the national mechanical codes, you can head on over to section M1503.6 of the 2018 code to find this text:\n\nM1503.6 Makeup air required. Where one or more gas, liquid or solid fuel-burning appliance that is neither direct-vent nor uses a mechanical draft venting system is located within a dwelling unit's air barrier, each exhaust system capable of exhausting in excess of 400 cubic feet per minute (0.19 m3\/s) shall be mechanically or passively provided with makeup air at a rate approximately equal to the exhaust air rate. Such makeup air systems shall be equipped with not fewer than one damper complying with Section M1503.6.2.\n\nEvery home should ideally be equipped with a properly installed, properly maintained, ducted range hood. If you don't have a one it's not a defect, but it worth considering an upgrade if a kitchen remodel is going to take place. Also, remember to use the range hood when you're cooking anything, and use the back burners when possible.","713":"Kobe Bryant 'had such a giving heart,' per Jamal Crawford Jamal Crawford couldn't stop crying when he heard that Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant had passed away.\n\nBryant and Crawford had a pretty close relationship. In fact, Crawford said that the Lakers icon \"had such a giving heart\" in an interview with Brandon \"Scoop B\" Robinson.\n\n\"Kobe was just out-of-this-world good. He was out-of-this-world competitive. He was brilliant and he had such a giving heart.

He was always giving and that was him,\" Jamal Crawford said about the Lakers great.\n\n\"Like when he came to my Pro-Am, I asked him when are you leaving and people were trying to shoo him off and rush him off and he said, 'I'm going to watch Jamal play.' He had his plane, he brought his family with him. He could've had any reason or any excuse to leave, but he didn't. He came. And that's some of the things that people don't see.

Text:\"...this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out\" (Acts 1:18)\n\nDesperation, according to Douglas Borton, 'is like stealing from a mafia; you stand a good chance of attracting the wrong attention' These words aptly describes the ministry of the desperate Judas Iscariot. Judas Iscariot was one of the disciples of our Lord Jesus Christ. Perhaps in Jesus' pursuit to deliver him from the innate spirit of dishonesty, he was the only disciple that Jesus entrusted with a department - he was the Minister of Finance or the Chief Accounting Officer of Jesus Christ's ministry. He was a man who saw Jesus raise the dead, saw the storm stilled, he was not on leave when the lame walked, the blinds' eyes were opened in his presence, he was a part of the commissioning to go and heal the sick and had a part in the testimonies that followed. Unfortunately for this man of history, he started life very promisingly but lived perfidiously and had a disastrous end.\n\nWhat separated Judas Iscariot from the other disciples was that firstly he was not only dishonest, but was deceitful and had a penchant for stealing from the ministry's purse. At Bethany, when Mary, the sister of Lazarus, broke the costly ointment to honour Jesus Christ, Judas Iscariot hid behind financial expediency and deceitful religiousity to lampoon Mary for that memorial act, which he regarded as a wastage, by saying that \"...Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein\" (John 12:4-6).\n\nThe other aspect of his life that eventually led to his dastardly end was that, for self-serving purposes, he \"...went unto the Chief priests, And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him\" (Matthew 26:14-16). Judas did not only collect money from the Chief priests but he saw to it that Jesus Christ was handed over to them and killed. When Jesus Christ returned from the Mount of Olives where He went for agonising prayers, the multitude came to Him with swords and other dangerous weapons, \"...he that was called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto Jesus to kiss him. But Jesus said unto him, Judas, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?\" (Luke 22:47-48). Judas Iscariot betrayed the Son of man with a kiss - a kiss! For dollars-and-cents reasons, he mortgaged his today and destroyed his glorious tomorrow.\n\nJudas Iscariot didn't learn from his forebearers like Gehazi who could have been one of the greatest prophets in history, if not for covetousness and betrayal of trust. Like Gehazi, Judas ended his life and ministry unceremoniously. Instead of having a memorial like the other disciples that never built personal houses but have reward of having monuments named after them today and eternal homes as a worthy icing, Judas Iscariot collected the money but never enjoyed the benefits to be derived therefrom, \"...he purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out\" (Acts 1:18). What happened to both of them gives credence to God's word in Jeremiah 17:11 that, \"As the partridge sitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not; so he that getteth riches, and not by right, shall leave them in the midst of his days, and at his end shall be a fool\".\n\nFew years ago, there was a woman who had a very wonderful marriage but never knew the true personality of her husband until he died. At the funeral service for the deceased, a strange woman walked inside the church and the man's family members asked her, to the uttermost shock, amazement and unbelief of the guests, to take her seat beside the weeping widow, as the man's second wife, together with her two sons that were obvious carbon copies of the deceased. In same way was a couple whose economy was quite harsh and they lived everyday managing the meagre resources available to them. It was when the woman died that the man discovered the financial worth of her deceased wife. To his utter consternation, the woman had a house from which she was collecting rents monthly, vehicles that she was using for commercial purposes and several bank accounts that were loaded with huge sums of money. Beloved in Christ, please note that every act of dishonesty, betrayal, backstabbing and deception will end in calamity!\n\nIn this world that is bereft of backstabbers, God is calling you to repentance as nothing lasts forever. As an employee, are you having honest dealings with your employers or trying to cut corners? - remember Judas Iscariot! As a married person, is your kiss romantic or a set up strategy? Are you living honestly or deceitfully with your spouse? Does your spouse know you and your net worth or will he\/she know only after death has come for you? As a friend, are you relating honestly with your friends or ready to sell them for pieces of silver? Are you wise in your own eyes forgetting that \"there is a way that seems right unto a man, but the end are the ways of death\"? (Proverbs 16:25). Judas betrayed with a kiss and died ignominiously and same went for Gehazi. It is my desire and prayer that your end shall be greater than your today. You shall fulfill divine destiny, in Jesus' name.\n\nBeloved in Christ, as we continue this Passion week and on the verge of ending this year's lent of glory manifestation, Jesus is enjoining you to amend your ways before it is too late, make a firm commitment to begin to live honestly and righteously with people that God has used to give you a lift up in times past, don't revel in treachery but start to live peaceably with all men (Hebrews 12:14; Romans 12:18).\n\nPrayer: Oh Lord, teach and continue to direct my steps so that I don't destroy your purpose for me through desperation and love of money, in Jesus' name.","716":"Lactate dehydrogenase inhibition synergizes with IL-21 to promote CD8+ T cell stemness and antitumor immunity Current approaches for producing T cells for adoptive immunotherapy for cancer rely on interleukin (IL)-2-based strategies that generate large numbers of tumor-reactive T cells but also drive the cells toward terminal differentiation and exhaustion, thereby diminishing their effectiveness. By characterizing the metabolic effects of IL-2 versus IL-21, a closely related cytokine that expands cells but lacks the detrimental effects of IL-2, we identified a pivotal role of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in regulating CD8+ T cell effector differentiation. Remarkably, LDH inhibition combined with IL-21 enhanced the formation of T memory stem cells and mitochondrial fitness while suppressing programs of exhaustion and senescence and markedly enhancing antitumor responses. These findings have potential therapeutic implications.\n\nInterleukin (IL)-2 and IL-21 dichotomously shape CD8 T cell differentiation. IL-2 drives terminal differentiation, generating cells that are poorly effective against tumors, whereas IL-21 promotes stem cell memory T cells (T) and antitumor responses. Here we investigated the role of metabolic programming in the developmental differences induced by these cytokines. IL-2 promoted effector-like metabolism and aerobic glycolysis, robustly inducing lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and lactate production, whereas IL-21 maintained a metabolically quiescent state dependent on oxidative phosphorylation. LDH inhibition rewired IL-2-induced effects, promoting pyruvate entry into the tricarboxylic acid cycle and inhibiting terminal effector and exhaustion programs, including mRNA expression of members of the NR4A family of nuclear receptors, as well as Prdm1 and Xbp1. While deletion of Ldha prevented development of cells with antitumor effector function, transient LDH inhibition enhanced the generation of memory cells capable of triggering robust antitumor responses after adoptive transfer. LDH inhibition did not significantly affect IL-21-induced metabolism but caused major transcriptomic changes, including the suppression of IL-21-induced exhaustion markers LAG3, PD1, 2B4, and TIM3. LDH inhibition combined with IL-21 increased the formation of T cells, resulting in more profound antitumor responses and prolonged host survival. These findings indicate a pivotal role for LDH in modulating cytokine-mediated T cell differentiation and underscore the therapeutic potential of transiently inhibiting LDH during adoptive T cell-based immunotherapy, with an unanticipated cooperative antitumor effect of LDH inhibition and IL-21.","717":"Landscape Photography Is so Much More Than the Wide Angle View | Are you guilty of only using a wide angle lens for landscape photography? If that is the case or you just want some confirmation that both a standard zoom and a telephoto lens also work, you might want to check out this video.\n\nMy main view and perspective of my landscape photography since I started has been that of the typical wide shot with a strong foreground element leading up and into the scene, where an epic mountain or waterfall made up the focal point. It is a powerful and attention-grabbing view and indeed still a perspective I enjoy in many cases, but recently, I have found myself drawn towards the longer focal lengths. There are several reasons to use longer focal lengths in landscape photography.\n\nI mention in the video that by using a longer focal length, it is easier to give a sense of the massive scales we are trying to capture in landscape photography. No matter whether you use a wide or a long lens, it is essential to have contrasting elements of different sizes within the photo. It can be a human against a glacier, a tree against a mountain wall, or a car against a big desert dune. However, by using the long lens and moving away from the subjects of your scene, it is easier to make the compressed view where the background and foreground element looks closer together, and you thereby get a more realistic sense of the difference in scale. I show this effect with several different examples.\n\nOne might ask if you compromise the sense of depth by \"compressing\" the scene, but worry not! There are also ways to create a strong sense of depth with the standard zoom and telephoto lens. I cover this too in the video above. Check it out and let me know how you feel about using longer focal lengths for landscape photography.","718":"Large Format Is Still Completely Unrivaled: 8x10 Versus Fuji GFX 100 Video of Large Format Is Still Completely Unrivaled: 8x10 vs Fuji GFX 100 (5DS R &amp; X1D II) Part 2\n\nPreviously, we compared a 4x5 film camera to the Canon 5DS R, and the film camera was able to produce incredible results. We mostly focused on the differences in depth of field for that comparison. With 4x5, you're able to produce beautiful bokeh and extremely shallow depth of field. In this latest video, we decided to look at the differences in resolution.\n\nIn our latest video, Anete and I were testing an 8x10 large format film camera from a company called Intrepid Camera. We decided the best way to properly test it was to put it up against some of the best digital cameras currently on the market. The digital cameras we settled on were the Canon 5DS R, the Hasselblad X1D II and the Fujifilm GFX 100, which we received from Hire a Camera.\n\nPersonally, I was really interested to see how the GFX 100 compared against large format. This is because in my view, the GFX 100 is one of the best medium format cameras currently on the market. The GF lenses also produce really sharp results, and I thought this would be the perfect system to compare.\n\nWhen it comes to the large format side of things, 8x10 is huge. The film size is so large that the crop factors are somewhat ridiculous. For example, when you're shooting at f\/22 on large format, the depth of field equivalent on full-frame (if you're trying to match the frame) would be somewhere around f\/2.8. This is great when you need a super shallow depth of field; however, it can be a huge pain when you need more depth of field. Exposure times can run away with you, and this is one of the major issues that can make shooting with large format inconvenient.\n\nNonetheless, the results you can produce with large format really are in a different league. Check out the full video to see how all four systems compare to one another.","719":"Late-life costs of raising sons in bighorn sheep Senescence, the physiological decline associated with aging, is pervasive in nature. The age at onset and rate of senescent decline vary widely among species, among populations of the same species, and even among individuals within the same population (1). Understanding the reasons for this variability is of great importance for the field of biogerontology, as well as from an evolutionary and ecological perspective (2). In evolutionary terms, senescence can be explained by a decline in the strength of natural selection with age (3). Because not all individuals survive to the oldest ages, genes with late-acting negative effects are able to accumulate in the genome [mutation accumulation (3)], and genes that confer an advantage in early life may spread even if they are costly in later life [antagonistic pleiotropy (4)]. The disposable soma theory can be considered as a physiological manifestation of antagonistic pleiotropy and posits that optimal resource allocation between growth, maintenance, and reproduction comes with fitness consequences late in life (5). Both antagonistic pleiotropy and disposable soma theories therefore predict trade-offs in performance between early and late life (6), and high resource allocation to reproduction early in life is expected to be associated with accelerated senescence (4, 5). Douhard et al. (7) examine whether the rate of senescence in a wild population of bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) is dependent on allocation of resources to reproduction in early life, testing key predictions of evolutionary and life-history theory (Fig. 1).","720":"Lawsuit Against Universal Music Over 2008 Warehouse Fire Is Dismissed Several high-profile musicians sued UMG last year over the loss of archived recordings\n\nA federal judge has dismissed several iconic musicians' lawsuit against Universal Music Group over a 2008 warehouse fire that destroyed archived recordings, The New York Times reports. The lawsuit was filed by Soundgarden, Steve Earle, Hole, and the estates of Tupac Shakur and Tom Petty last year in response to a Times investigation of Hollywood warehouse fire that reportedly destroyed many master tapes.\n\nFollowing the case's filing, all of the plaintiffs dropped out of the lawsuit except Tom Petty's former wife Jane Petty. Hole dropped out in August \"based on UMG's written assurances to Plaintiffs' counsel that no Hole master recordings were lost in the fire.\" Soundgarden and Tupac's estate pulled out last month.\n\nToday, Judge John A. Kronstadt dismissed Jane Petty's claims without prejudice. The judge argued that Petty's former label MCA (a subsidiary of UMG) owned Petty's masters. The judge ruled that Jane Petty therefore couldn't sue.\n\nIn legal filings, UMG lawyers named 19 specific artists who had archived material damaged or destroyed in the fire, outlining where specific digital replacement copies existed. Universal's lawyers claimed that the plaintiffs' lawyers were \"irresponsibly conflating lost assets (everything from safeties and videos to artwork) with original album masters in a desperate attempt to inject substance into their meritless legal case.\" Universal has consistently disputed the Times' initial report.\n\nHoward King, one of the lawyers representing plaintiffs, responded: \"Universal claimed 17,000 artists were affected by the fire when they were suing for damages. Now that they face a lawsuit by their artists, they claim a mere 19 artists were affected.

(AP) -- The family of a boy is suing a police officer who mistakenly fired his weapon inside a southern New Mexico middle school and nearly hit the student.\n\nThe family recently filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court against officer Francisco Estrada and the Las Cruces Police Department, the Las Cruces Sun-News reports.\n\nAuthorities say Estrada accidentally fired his gun in December inside his office at Picacho Middle School, where he was assigned as a resource officer. Officials say Estrada was alone in his office and the gunshot struck no one.\n\nBut according to court documents, the bullet came within inches of striking a 13-year-old student. The lawsuit says the bullet came so close that the boy's hearing was damaged.\n\nThe family alleges that the child has been too traumatized to return to school and is enrolled in the Las Cruces Public Schools' program for homebound students.\n\nSurveillance footage from the hallway also shows a bullet penetrating the wall of the principal's office into a hallway just 43 seconds after three individuals passed the spot.\n\n\"The defendant intentionally violated basic firearm safety by pointing his gun at innocent children,\" the family's attorney Margaret Strickland told the Sun-News. \"If we are going to allow armed police into our schools, we must hold them to a high standard, and that means accountability.\"\n\nThe family is seeking compensatory and punitive damages. Their lawsuit names both Estrada and the Las Cruces Police Department.\n\nLas Cruces police spokesman Dan Trujillo says Estrada is still with the department. He says police couldn't comment on pending litigation.\n\nCopyright 2020 Associated Press. All rights reserved.

It is the capacity to influence, inspire, rally, direct, encourage, motivate, induce, move, mobilize, and activate others to pursue a common goal or purpose while maintaining commitment, momentum, confidence and courage.\n\nThere are different kinds of leadership required for different times. Scholars have pointed out that the period of crisis requires charismatic leadership with a combination of intelligence, purpose, grace under pressure and consideration for followers.\n\nPoor leadership can make a crisis situation worse especially if impending threats are ignored, wrong decisions made or impression created in the mind of citizens that the leaders do not care.\n\nLeadership during crisis aims to minimise impact, save lives, protect property and infrastructure and restore public trust on government. This requires initiative and imagination especially if the crisis is new like Covid-19.\n\nSome scholars have provided a framework for leadership in times of crisis.[iii] According to the framework, a leader needs to focus on the following ten issues during crisis:\n\nEarly recognition of the crisis and the threat it poses.\n\nFacilitating a collective understanding of the nature, characteristics, consequences, potential scope and effects of an evolving threat.\n\nMaking strategic decision in a timely manner after some form of due process.\n\nOrchestrating co-ordination among government agencies, private sector and citizens especially those affected by the crisis.\n\nAdopting a systems approach to the crisis looking at all its dimensions and connections.\n\nProvide authentic hope and confidence to the people.\n\nProvide mass communication in a timely manner. Ensure correct information at all times as one wrong information can jeopardise all the efforts.\n\nRender accountability. Explain what is being done and why. Provide cost of action and services rendered.\n\nLearn as you implement. Learn during the crisis about what is working and after the crisis on what has worked for future purposes.\n\nEnhance resilience. Prepare individuals and organisations for resilience and the ability to absorb shocks, recover quickly, adapt and respond to situation.\n\nThis framework can be applied to Covid-19 and other crises. Response to Covid-19 will be effective if the threat is recognised early and response put in place in terms of good health system, testing and treatment and prevention and control measures.\n\nIf delay happens at the initial stage, the spread will go out of hand with disastrous consequences. If people do not understand the level of threat, they will respond negatively to prevention and control measures. If strategic decision of lock down is not taken on time, the disease will overwhelm the health system especially if the system is weak.\n\nIf there is no co-ordination and engagement with citizens, government will roll out programmes with citizen opposition. If authentic hope and confidence is not given to people, some will not understand why they should make sacrifice that a lock down requires.\n\nIf correct information is not provided in a way that it will get to all, rumour mongering and fake news will thrive. If account is not rendered periodically and transparently, support from citizens cannot be assured.\n\nIn the Nigerian case, many citizens are already annoyed that corporate bodies, banks and wealthy individuals are donating money to government. If we do not learn quickly what works, we will not be able to replicate in other places.\n\nThe isolation and treatment centre in Lagos has come out with great results. We must learn quickly why this is so and how it can be replicated in the other 35 states and FCT.\n\nFinally, we need to prepare individuals and organisations for resilience as we respond to the Covid-19 crisis and other crisis in the future.","723":"Leak reveals that iOS 14 will include Android features that iPhone users have long wanted In the long-running smartphone OS war known as iOS vs. Android, one of the biggest complaints about Apple's mobile OS is that it is not as customizable as Android.

In addition, when enrolling personal care assistants, DHS does not verify that they meet all requirements in state law. In a small number of cases, this resulted in some children under age 16 working as PCAs in violation of state law. The agency also did not take timely action to fully investigate hundreds of suspected cases of fraud and abuse, according to the 122-page report.\n\nAt the same time, the auditor's report found that DHS has made progress over the past decade in preventing fraud in the program. The agency has implemented electronic controls that have been \"generally effective\" in preventing payments for claims that asserted personal care assistants worked more than 24 hours in a day or consecutive 24-hour days, which the legislative auditor's office identified as obvious signs of fraud when it last reviewed the program in 2009.\n\n\"Over the past eleven years, DHS and the Legislature have made changes to strengthen the oversight\" of the program, wrote Legislative Auditor James Nobles. \"However, opportunities for improvement remain.\"\n\nFounded four decades ago, the personal care assistance program has long been considered an essential element of the state's social safety net. Approximately 44,000 Minnesotans received home care services in 2018 through the program, which is funded through Medicaid, the state-federal health insurance program that covers 1.1 million Minnesotans.\n\n\"Without this program, the lives of Minnesotans would be fundamentally impacted, and in some cases, lives would be at risk,\" Gertrude Matemba-Mutasa, assistant commissioner for Community Supports at the DHS, said in testimony Monday before a Senate committee.\n\nThe legislative auditor's findings come at a time when the state's largest agency is trying to restore public confidence in its management practices. That confidence has been shaken by revelations of a series of costly financial missteps in the state's Medicaid program.\n\nSince early last summer, DHS officials have acknowledged that repeated breakdowns in internal controls caused the agency to make more than $100 million in overpayments for substance-use treatment services. At legislative hearings, Jodi Harpstead, the incoming commissioner of the $18.5 billion DHS, has pledged to shore up internal controls at the agency.\n\nIn a written statement issued Monday, Harpstead said, \"We support continuous improvement efforts in all DHS programs and are proud of the strides we have made in overseeing PCA services across Minnesota since the last OLA audit in 2009.\"\n\nHowever, she cautioned, \"We are concerned that additional requirements could make it more difficult for people to find assistance and for providers to stay in business. We will work with the Legislature to find the right balance of regulatory oversight and program flexibility in the best interests of the people served.\"\n\nMuch of the legislative auditor's report focused on inconsistencies within the state's system for determining eligibility for PCA services, which can result in people receiving different levels of assistance. \"It is important to have reasonably consistent assessments ... to ensure equal access to services,\" Jodi Rodr\u00edguez, a project manager at the legislative auditor's office, said in Senate testimony.\n\nFor decades, county social workers used a paper-based system for screening who was eligible for PCA and other services through Medicaid. Then in 2013, the state launched an automated system, known as MnChoices, that was meant to standardize the evaluation process. However, DHS has not required all agencies to use this new system, which means that people across the state are still being evaluated with two separate tools with varying requirements. The result is a lack of uniformity: For instance, all county assessors who complete assessments through MnChoices must be certified and undergo training, while assessors who still use the legacy, paper-based system are not required to do so.\n\nIn addition, the auditor found problems within the state's MnChoices system that can also lead to inconsistent results. Assessors who use the tool, for instance, are given the flexibility to vary the order and phrasing of the questions in the automated tool. As a result, people can receive different amounts of PCA services based on who is using the MnChoices tool, the auditor found.\n\nThe auditor's findings echo those of a Star Tribune investigative report last fall, which found multiple problems with the state's high-stakes system for determining eligibility for Medicaid services. Across the state, the investigation found, access to this assistance was often arbitrary and unpredictable -- dependent on where people lived rather than on individual need.\n\nDHS is developing a revised version of MnChoices, and the department plans to require all county agencies to use it for evaluating people for services. However, DHS does not expect to roll out the new version until at least 2021.\n\nThe legislative auditor's office also found that not all personal care assistants underwent background studies and training before providing services, as required under state law. Some of the PCAs did not meet the state's minimum age requirements. The auditor found 48 children who were enrolled as personal care assistants before their 16th birthday, which is not allowed under state law. The auditor also found nearly 180 personal care assistants under 18 years of age who were affiliated with at least two PCA agencies, which also is not allowed.\n\nThe auditor's office made 20 recommendations for improving oversight and consistency in the program, including that the DHS establish a firm timeline for requiring assessors to use the MnChoices tool for all PCA assessments. The auditor also recommended that the Legislature require the DHS to regularly evaluate the consistency of assessments, among other measures.\n\n\"The concern about consistency and about fraud has been a perpetual problem for years,\" said Sen. Jim Abeler, R-Anoka, chairman of the Senate Human Services Reform Finance and Policy Committee. \"It is disappointing that we have still have to be discussing this.\"","726":"Leicester vs Aston Villa: Jamie Vardy, Harvey Barnes Help Leicester Thrash Aston Villa 4-0 | Football News Brendan Rodgers hopes Leicester can kick on from a confidence-boosting 4-0 thrashing of Aston Villa, thanks to doubles from Harvey Barnes and Jamie Vardy, and secure a place in next season's Champions League. The Foxes had won just one of their previous seven Premier League games, but remain in third and restored an eight-point advantage over fifth-placed Manchester United in the battle for a top-four finish. \"The last few games we haven't been at our level. In terms of attacking, we were much better this evening. After the first goal we went on and played very well,\" said Rodgers.\n\n\"Early on you could see our confidence wasn't where it has been. The only way you regain that confidence is hard work and these players have been brilliant.\"\n\nDefeat leaves Villa rooted in the relegation zone and there was little from the visitors to suggest they can save themselves in the final 10 games of the season.\n\nNo side has conceded more goals in the Premier League this season than Villa and it was easy to see why as Leicester passed up a host of simple chances from poorly defended set-pieces early on.\n\n\"We started the game quite well but then we didn't defend corners well enough and we had a big mistake for the (first) goal,\" said Villa boss Dean Smith.\n\n\"Individual mistakes are costing us. We need to get better.\"\n\nPepe Reina was a spectator when Villa stunned Leicester to reach the League Cup final in January and Dean Smith's decision to recall the Spaniard in place of Orjan Nyland backfired for the opening goal five minutes before half-time.\n\nThe former Liverpool goalkeeper raced well outside his box, but was beaten to the ball by the pace of Barnes, who kept his cool to fire into an unguarded net.\n\nIheanacho then missed a great chance to double Leicester's lead early in the second half and the Nigerian may find himself back on the sidelines in the weeks to come as Vardy refound his scoring touch.\n\nThe former England striker started on the bench as he returned from injury and had only been on the field four minutes when he grabbed his first goal in 10 games from the penalty spot after Tyrone Mings was adjudged to have handled Barnes's cross.\n\nVardy was back in the groove and doubled his tally 11 minutes from time when he found space at Reina's near post to move two goals clear in the race for the Premier League golden boot.\n\n\"The injury over seven or eight weeks had curtailed him but his running and movement were back to what we are used to from him,\" added Rodgers on his top scorer. \"He got his reward for his hard work.\"\n\nBarnes then also smashed home his second of the evening from Marc Albrighton's low cross.","727":"Lennie James is electrifying in the clever, gripping Save Me Too - r... If you want to know how Nelly (Lennie James) is doing 17 months on from the disappearance of his daughter, Jody, you only need look at his coat. When we first met him in the 2018 drama Save Me, his trademark yellow puffa was fresh on, full of sunshine and hot air. Now, much like Nelly, it is grimy and deflated but still in one piece.\n\nIt's inevitable that the early scenes of Save Me Too (Sky Atlantic) don't have the paralysing tension of its critically adored predecessor, though that's not a complaint. At the start of the first series, Nelly was hauled out of bed and into a police station to be told his estranged 13-year-old daughter had gone missing; she had left behind a video in which she told her mother, Claire (Suranne Jones), that she was going to meet her dad. Only it turned out the man she had been talking to online was not Nelly and she was walking into a trap laid by sex traffickers.\n\nThe second series delivers a more creeping anxiety as Nelly, who we first see sitting in a car with bloodied hands, focuses his attention on Grace (Olive Gray), the girl he inadvertently rescued at the end of the first series and could be the key to finding Jody. Grace is 14 and hooked on the drugs supplied by Gideon (Adrian Edmondson), a sixtysomething man who she once called her boyfriend. Nelly needs to get to Gideon, who he suspects knows of Jody's whereabouts, and who was last seen auctioning off girls to the highest bidder. Nelly needs to get to Gideon, who we last saw auctioning off girls to the highest bidder and who he reckons knows Jody's whereabouts. In order to find him, Nelly approaches Gideon's wife, Jennifer (Lesley Manville), a woman rendered hollow by the realisation that her marital role was not that of a soulmate but a smokescreen for her husband's basest urges.\n\nOnce again, James is electrifying as Nelly, the flawed and infuriating protagonist who seeks forgiveness for his absence by returning his child safely to her mother. Nelly's intentions are good and his commitment unexpected, but he is also impulsive, self-interested, a serial screw-up. Where Blanche DuBois famously depended on the kindness of strangers, Nelly depends on the neighbours on his estate for a roof over his head, for the use of a car, for a tenner or a pint. Before to all this, he'd have been the last person you went to in a crisis.\n\nIt can be hard to take your eyes off James here, but not to would be to miss some quietly brilliant performances, among them Stephen Graham as Melon, a convicted sex offender who insists he has been rehabilitated, and Alice Feetham as his young wife Bernie, who is now pregnant. At a scan they find out they are having a girl; Melon is delighted but Bernie's plastered-on smile masks a concern she dare not voice. But it's the script, written by James, that truly takes the breath away: clever, gripping while never slipping into clich\u00e9. The existence of Save Me Too could be seen as superfluous, an unnecessary stringing out of a near-perfect thriller. However, our hero's failure to find his child first time around is an apt reflection of his character - a well-meaning man who so often falls short. It stands to reason that Nelly would stubbornly keep up the search, a would-be saviour in a tatty polyester coat.","728":"Lesley Nneka Arimah wins the Caine Prize for African Writing Lesley Nneka Arimah, who lived for many years in Minnesota, has won the 2019 Caine Prize for African Writing for her short story, \"Skinned,\" which was published by McSweeney's. \"Skinned\" had previously won the National Magazine Award for Fiction.

Naval missions, training programmes, capital investment and capacity building projects were among the responses to the threat. States in the region also started to focus on the dangers and opportunities associated with the sea.\n\nKenya and Djibouti, two states directly affected by piracy, achieved widespread reform of their domestic maritime sectors through new national initiatives and assistance from external partners. Djibouti's President Ismail Guelleh recently commented during talks with Kenya on security and trade links that\n\nWhat happens in Somalia has an immediate impact on all of us.\n\nAt its height, between 2008 and 2012, it is estimated that Somali piracy cost the Kenyan shipping industry between US$300 million and $400 million every year. This was as a result of increased costs (including insurance) and a decline in coastal tourism. It also damaged Djibouti's maritime industry, financial sector and international trade.\n\nThe upsurge of piracy after 2005 had a number of causes. It grew from poverty and lawlessness in Somalia alongside opportunity and a low risk of getting caught. By 2013 the threat had been reduced. This was due to a combination of naval patrols, private armed guards, self defence measures on board ships and capacity building efforts ashore.\n\nHistorically, most states in the Horn of Africa have struggled with limited capacity to address maritime insecurity. Their naval assets, training, human resources, institutional and judicial structures, monitoring and surveillance have all been critically underfunded.\n\nBut the international response to piracy - and the investments and partnerships that emerged - have helped some states to improve in these areas.\n\nMore importantly perhaps, since the decline in piracy attacks, Kenya and Djibouti have been paying more attention to policies around maritime governance and \"blue\" economic development. This relates to sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, job creation and ocean ecosystem health. The refocus marks a shift from traditional investments related to land based conflict and land borders.\n\nIn a recent article, I examine how Kenya and Djibouti reformed their domestic maritime sectors following a decline in acts of piracy. The study sheds new light on the limitations and challenges facing domestic maritime sectors in Africa as well as some of the innovative approaches taken.\n\nA key point is that blue economic growth is not possible without addressing security threats at sea. This includes building a robust maritime security sector, improving ocean health and regulating human activity at sea in a more sustainable way.\n\nInternational partnerships\n\nMany of the new developments in the region have been supported by international partners. The Djibouti Navy and Coastguard work closely with the US Navy. Together, for example, they are developing capacity for stopping and searching suspicious vessels. This is important in countering the illicit trafficking in people and smuggling of migrants through Djiboutian waters.\n\nDjibouti has also benefited from Chinese direct investment, which accounts for nearly 40% of the funding for its major investment projects. Chinese state-owned firms have built some of Djibouti's largest maritime related infrastructure projects. These include the Doraleh Multipurpose Port, a new railway connection between Djibouti and Addis Ababa, and the opening of China's first foreign military facility.\n\nThis is a clear example of Beijing prioritising its growing economic and security interests in Africa. And advancing its \"massive and geopolitically ambitious\" Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nKenya, too, has received international assistance and investment. This includes support to set up the Regional Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre in Mombasa. Organisations like the International Maritime Organisation have led training for staff from the centre and for the Kenyan Navy.\n\nThe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime has provided law enforcement training for the Kenyan Maritime Police Unit. It also opened a new high-security courtroom in Shimo La Tewa, Mombasa, for cases of maritime piracy and other serious criminal offences.\n\nNational refocus\n\nAt a national level, there is evidence of a fundamental shift towards building a more secure and sustainable domestic maritime sector.\n\nFor example, Kenya has created a new coastguard service. Its job is to police the country's ocean territory and to ensure that Kenya benefits from its water resources. The country has new naval training partnerships, maritime capacity building projects and an implementation committee to coordinate \"blue economic\" activities. These include fisheries, shipping, port infrastructure, tourism and environmental protection.\n\nFor its part, Djibouti has rapidly developed its maritime sector and recognised the financial benefits of leasing coastal real estate. The country has an ambitious development plan titled \"Djibouti Vision 2035\". This sets out its aspiration to become a maritime hub and the \"Singapore of Africa\". It's trading on the fact that it has a similar strategic position along one of the world's busiest shipping lanes.\n\nAll of these approaches require robust laws and regulations governing human activities at sea. They also call for a capable and flexible coastguard and navy to enforce these regulations and secure coastal waters against threats such as piracy, fisheries crime and the illicit smuggling of drugs, weapons and people.\n\nThe way forward\n\nThere are lessons in the Horn of Africa experience for other regions of Africa facing similar maritime insecurities. One example is the Gulf of Guinea.\n\nThe first lesson is that there's a need to convince coastal states with weak maritime capacities of the untapped potential of the blue economy. Even reputational damage can harm tourism, development and investment in coastal regions. This was clearly illustrated in the case of Kenya.\n\nBlue economic growth needs a safe and secure maritime environment for merchant shipping in particular. It can also help alleviate poverty in coastal regions, provide alternatives to criminal livelihoods, and allow local communities more ownership of issues that affect them.\n\nUltimately, maritime security and blue economic growth need to be considered as a unified policy issue.","730":"Light and bright fashion finds for spring The overall tone for 2020 has been heavy.

For a week the internet abounded with pictures of selfish jackwads pushing a Costco cart laden with bales of Charmin, answering the question of whether the men who pushed aside small children to get on a Titanic lifeboat were, in fact, reincarnated. Apparently so!\n\nYou ask: Will there be opportunities for different kinds of shaming? Yes. There's sanitizer shaming. If you find yourself in a store that got a shipment, and you see someone taking all the containers like a roulette table winner pulling in all the chips, you should most definitely shame them. But how?\n\nGlaring? In the Before Times, glaring was satisfying, because, by gosh, you let them know what you thought. Your eyes were like wood-burning tools, etching nasty thoughts. You might even huff or snort, or make a huffy snort.\n\nAlas, I must inform you: Snorts or huffs are useless against these people now.\n\nIf you want to get aggressively passive-aggressive, you might say, \"Well, I guess someone's hands are more important than everyone else's hands.\"\n\nOr: You could fake a huge sneeze. Then you explain: \"Allergies! I get a reaction to selfish people whose entitlement keeps useful products out of the hands of the vulnerable population.\"\n\nThat should make them put some back on the shelf. If not, try a glare. But not a huffy glare -- we have to save that for vaccine-line-cutter shaming.","733":"Lileks: What could possibly be the problem with us all telecommuting? The upside of living in a world of plague and financial-markets chaos? We have computers now. Note: This is also the downside, but let's think positive.\n\nUnlike the people who suffered through the Spanish Flu, we can telecommute. In 1918, people who worked from home had to conduct their business with messenger pigeons and semaphore flags, which wasn't very efficient. Your boss sent you a message via bird, and as you walked to the window, you saw the pigeon smack into your window hard, fall and end up three stories below in the trash bin. \"Aw, it went to my junk folder.\"\n\nThere's a popular belief that you're safe from infection if you stay home, but only if you stay off social media. If you hang around Twitter and Facebook, you end up thinking that COVID-19 can be transmitted by looking at Chinese takeout menus, or Italian travel packages, but it can be cured by essential oils. Do you have an essential oil? You wonder. Are there nonessential oils? What if I rub a little 3-in-One lubricant on my pressure points?\n\nThen you remember that part of working from home -- a very important part, your boss might say -- involves \"working,\" so you call up your e-mail and leave the window open.\n\nEveryone's working from home, it seems. Here's where I envision that ending up:\n\nI need to get the oil in my car changed, and the shop has a sign that says they are all working from home. Addresses are listed. I drive to one of the places -- it is an apartment -- and he does the oil change in the living room while I sit in the kitchen and read old magazines about shooting birds. He says I need a new oil filter; good thing he has a closet full of them.\n\nAfter that I need some gas and milk, so it is off to the convenience store. Same thing; the clerks are working from home. I have to go to two places. The first house has the gas -- the clerk had filled up his bathtub with EcoBoost Regular, and we use a siphon to get it into my car. \"Hey, what about my grocery store rewards?\" Oh, right. I tap my phone number on his forehead, and he thinks for a few seconds and then calculates the discount.\n\nThe milk run is about a mile away. On the way there, a car almost hits me when it blasts through a red light. But, wouldn't you know it, there is a police officer working from home on the corner, and he runs out and gives the guy a ticket.\n\nThe convenience store clerk is working from home like everyone else. I get some milk out of her fridge. The chips and candy bars are stacked up on the sofa. I tell her this is all an overreaction. \"I mean, what are the odds we'll get it? Oh, and one lottery ticket, please.\"\n\nLater that evening, I am cooking dinner and a dish towel gets too close to a burner and catches on fire. Before I get it doused, some sparks hit the napkin rack, and before you know it, the kitchen is a conflagration. Dang! I dial 911 before I think: \"Oh, yeah, right\" -- So I drive to the 911 operator's house, get the address of a fireman, then take my kitchen to a townhouse downtown, where a guy hoses it down with the spray nozzle from his sink.\n\n\"It's nice to work at home, isn't it?\" I say. \"I don't know why we don't do this all the time.\"\n\nHe gives me this strange look, like I am some guy who thinks all jobs consist of sitting in a chair and moving your fingers on a keyboard. Obviously, that's not so. But the important jobs, sure. I mean, without people sitting in chairs and moving their fingers over keyboards, what would get done?","734":"Lineup adjustment helps lead to go-ahead basket for Jordan McLaughlin MIAMI - Down the stretch in the Timberwolves' 129-126 victory over the Heat, coach Ryan Saunders made a lineup decision he hasn't made much since the Wolves acquired point guard D'Angelo Russell.\n\nHe played Russell and backup point guard Jordan McLaughlin together in the final minutes.\n\nThe move paid off, with McLaughlin scoring the go-ahead layup with 8.5 seconds to play.\n\nSaunders said he made the move to help alleviate some pressure on Russell.\n\n\"They were blitzing D'Angelo in pick and rolls, trying to get the ball out of his hands,\" Saunders said. \"So I figured we'd get him off the ball a little bit, and Jordan is a good pick and roll player as well. He's got a toughness about him, especially late in the games, he's an unflappable guy.\"\n\nIt continued a strong stretch of play for McLaughlin, who is on a two-way contract. McLaughlin is averaging 11 points and 5.3 assists over his last seven games.\n\n\"They were basically shadowing [Russell] and that's why coach put me in the game to handle the ball, try and get him off the ball, maybe set pin downs for him and stuff like that,\" McLaughlin said. \"We tried doing that and we had the hammer screen where Jake slipped and got fouled [leading to two free throws that put the Wolves ahead 125-124. All the attention was focused on D-Lo, and it allowed us to get other options with me being the playmaker.\"\n\nMcLaughlin has been doing a decent amount of that of late of the Wolves. The Wolves haven't engaged McLaughlin in talks about solidifying his place on the roster permanently a source said, but McLaughlin has been making a strong case that he belongs in the NBA.","735":"Linking bedrock discontinuities to glacial quarrying | Annals of Glaciology | Cambridge Core Quarrying and abrasion are the two principal processes responsible for glacial erosion of bedrock. The morphologies of glacier hard beds depend on the relative effectiveness of these two processes, as abrasion tends to smooth bedrock surfaces and quarrying tends to roughen them. Here we analyze concentrations of bedrock discontinuities in the Tsanfleuron forefield, Switzerland, to help determine the geologic conditions that favor glacial quarrying over abrasion. Aerial discontinuity concentrations are measured from scaled drone-based photos where fractures and bedding planes in the bedrock are manually mapped. A Tukey honest significant difference test indicates that aerial concentration of bed-normal bedrock discontinuities is not significantly different between quarried and non-quarried areas of the forefield. Thus, an alternative explanation is needed to account for the spatial variability of quarried areas. To investigate the role that bed-parallel discontinuities might play in quarrying, we use a finite element model to simulate bed-normal fracture propagation within a stepped bed with different step heights. Results indicate that higher steps (larger spacing of bed-parallel discontinuities) propagate bed-normal fractures more readily than smaller steps. Thus, the spacing of bed-parallel discontinuities could exert strong control on quarrying by determining the rate that blocks can be loosened from the host rock.","736":"Lions And Legendary Running Back Barry Sanders React to Al Kaline's Death The Detroit sports family suffered a tough loss on Monday when Detroit Tigers legend Al Kaline passed away, and Detroit Lions legend Barry Sanders as well as his former team had a lot to say about it.\n\nIn the aftermath of Kaline passing away, Sanders hopped on Twitter and provided a great message to Detroit and sports fans everywhere. As he said, it is tough to lose Kaline.\n\nIn addition to Sanders, the Lions themselves revealed a statement which revealed their sympathies for the loss of the Detroit baseball legend.\n\nObviously, Kaline was embedded in the fabric of the city deeply, and the football team embraced him.\n\nIn a decorated career, Kaline is known for being one of the rare athletes who stuck with his original team through thick and thin. After coming to the Tigers in 1953, he played with Detroit until 1974 racking up 18 All Star game invites. He was the American League's batting champion in 1955, and won the World Series in 1968. In his career, Kaline had 3,007 hits and won 10 Gold Gloves. After his career was over, he worked closely with the Tigers' front office.\n\nMajor League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred released a statement which celebrated the life of Kaline:\n\n\"Many of us who are fortunate enough to work in Baseball have our short lists of the players who mean the most to us. Al Kaline was one of those players for me and countless others, making this a very sad day for our sport. A lifelong Tiger, Al was a true gentleman and one of the National Pastime's most universally respected figures. I appreciated his friendship, humility and the example that he always set for others since he debuted as an 18-year-old rookie.\n\n\"On behalf of Major League Baseball, I extend my deepest condolences to Al's wife, Louise, their family and friends, his admirers and the generations of Tiger fans who looked up to him.\"\n\nKaline will be missed by everyone thanks to what he did on the field and off.\n\nTo see Sanders run the ball for Lions fans through the years was to believe given what he was able to do with the team on the field. Sanders routinely had the quickness and deft ability to break plenty of ankles on the football field and remains one of the greatest highlights in the game fans love watching even years after his retirement. Athleticism is something that came naturally to Sanders, no matter whether he was on the grass or the hardwood, something that was revealed recently.\n\nWith the Lions, Sanders rushed for 15,269 yards and 99 touchdowns. He was routinely thought of as the best running back in the league, and would have shattered plenty of NFL rushing records had he decided to keep playing. Sanders, however, walked away from the game in 1999 on the eve of training camp, which stunned the Lions and all of their fans. The parties then went through a frustrating split for multiple years, based mostly upon the fact that the franchise made him pay back part of his contract amid retirement. It is a situation not unlike what is happening with Calvin Johnson currently.\n\nSince, time has healed all wounds and Sanders has patched things up with the Lions and has become engaged in their alumni group. He also makes several visits a year to games the team is playing in, and was recently named to Detroit's All-Century team, which is a major feather in his cap given what he was able to do as a team leader and a dominating force in the franchise.\n\nAs a result of his early retirement, Sanders maintains his health and vitality and looks phenomenal. It's not a stretch to say that he could possibly still grind out some tough yards in the league at this point in time.\n\nNow that Kaline has passed on, it's possible Sanders will have to take the mantle as Mr. Detroit.","737":"Lithoquest Diamonds Inc.: Lithoquest Diamonds Announces Extension of Its Non-Brokered Private Placement Not for distribution to the United States news wire services or for dissemination in the United States\n\nVANCOUVER, BC \/ ACCESSWIRE \/ April 6, 2020 \/ Lithoquest Diamonds Inc.

Addressing this experimental bottleneck, we developed a strategy to quantify dissociation constants for lipid-protein interactions and transmembrane flip-flop rates of native lipids in live-cell experiments. Using a combination of plasma membrane-specific photochemical probes and mathematical modeling, we demonstrate that, for diacylglycerols as a model lipid class, the inherent lipid structural diversity caused by variations in acyl chain composition determines lipid protein affinities and transbilayer kinetics. In fact, subtle chemical differences change these values by orders of magnitude. Our approach represents a generally applicable method for elucidating the biological function of single lipid species on subcellular scales.","740":"Liverpool vs Atletico: Atletico Madrid Reach Champions League Last Eight | Football News Champions League: Marcos Llorente's extra-time double helped Atletico Madrid grab a 3-2 win on the night over Liverpool and 4-2 victory on aggregate.\n\nAtletico Madrid stunned holders Liverpool to reach the Champions League quarter-finals on Wednesday as Marcos Llorente's extra-time double helped grab a 3-2 win on the night and 4-2 victory on aggregate. A terrific defensive display took Diego Simeone's men to extra time after Georginio Wijnaldum's first-half header drew Liverpool level at 1-1 in the tie. And although Roberto Firmino briefly put Jurgen Klopp's hosts ahead, Llorente struck twice in nine minutes before Alvaro Morata added further gloss to the scoreline. For much of this season, Liverpool had looked like an unstoppable juggernaut as they powered towards the Premier League title and a potentially successful defence of the Champions League.\n\nBut in the space of just three weeks, Jurgen Klopp's team have unexpectedly lost their way and the slump has shattered their bid for a seventh European Cup and an unbeaten Premier League campaign.\n\nWhen Liverpool arrived in Madrid for the first leg on February 18, they were on the crest of a wave.\n\nBut a limp 1-0 defeat there was an unsettling glimpse of what was to come as the Reds' run of 18 successive Premier League wins was ended by lowly Watford in a stunning 3-0 defeat.\n\nA 2-0 FA Cup fifth round defeat at Chelsea would be partially excused by Klopp sending out a slightly weakened team.\n\nLiverpool still looked shaky in a narrow 2-1 success against struggling Bournemouth on Saturday, yet they should have been out of sight before Atletico authored their incredible comeback.\n\nThe hosts had 26 shots in the first 90 minutes but could only manage one goal from Georginio Wijnaldum thanks to their poor finishing and the inspired form of Atletico keeper Jan Oblak.\n\nThat forced extra time and when Roberto Firmino scored his first Anfield goal of the season Liverpool were 2-1 up on aggregate.\n\nYet Adrian's mistake was punished by Marcos Llorente to give the Spaniards hope and Llorente netted again before Alvaro Morata capped the epic collapse.\n\nLiverpool will still win the title but the shock on Klopp's face was clear to see.\n\nAdrian blunders again\n\nJust 167 seconds after Roberto Firmino appeared to have put Liverpool on course for the quarter-finals, Adrian's howler gave Atletico a lifeline that turned the tie on its head.\n\nThe Liverpool goalkeeper made a total hash of a routine kick downfield and booted the ball straight to Joao Felix.\n\nAtletico striker Felix picked out Llorente and he cut inside to fire back past Adrian.\n\nIt was a hammer blow that Liverpool could not recover from, underlining just how much Klopp's side missed the injured Alisson Becker.\n\nAdrian, 33, has been guilty of other errors this season when he has stood in for Alisson this term and once again he fluffed his lines.\n\nAlisson is sidelined with a hip injury suffered in training prior to Liverpool's FA Cup defeat at Chelsea and former West Ham keeper Adrian was guilty of allowing Willian's shot to slip through his grasp into the net in that clash.\n\nWhile Liverpool look certain to win the Premier League regardless of who is in goal, Alisson is not expected back in the short term, giving Klopp a headache as he considers whether to keep faith with Adrian.","741":"Liverpool vs Bournemouth: Live Streaming, When And Where To Watch | Football News Liverpool will look to extend their 22-point lead at the top of the table when they take on Bournemouth at home.\n\nLiverpool will look to get back to winning ways when they take on Bournemouth at home on Saturday. After going on a remarkable winning streak, Liverpool are going through a sudden dip in form, having lost three of their last four matches. First, they lost to Atletico Madrid in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16. Then, Watford dashed their hopes of an invincible season in the league with a 3-0 win before Chelsea ended their treble dreams by dumping them out of the FA Cup. However, Liverpool would fancy their chances against 18th-placed Bournemouth as they look to go 25 points clear of second-placed Manchester City, who take on Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday night. \"Of course winning gives you confidence, losing costs you confidence, that's completely normal,\" Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said before the match. \"It's how you get back on track immediately and you can do that not by hoping that things are now clicking even better than the game before so we have just to work really hard.

THE English Premier League is in limbo; nobody knows when or how the league will resume. Liverpool are poised right on the brink of clinching a historic and long-awaited title. But for now they, like everyone else, must wait.\n\nThere is widespread agreement in the game that Liverpool are deserving champions and that the title should be theirs however the season is concluded. A 25-point lead at the top and only one league defeat all season demonstrate their dominance.\n\nPremier League bosses and club officials met again last week (via video conference) for a further round of talks on everything from the timing of a possible resumption of football to collective cuts to players' wages.\n\nBut all planning is currently taking place amid more unknowns than even Donald Rumsfeld conceived.\n\nWhat we do know is that a clear commitment remains to completing the 2019-2020 season. Some of the reported proposals for doing so - matches played behind closed doors in one or two cities with squads kept in isolation throughout, or even a suggestion of decamping en masse to China to finish the season - go beyond clutching at distant straws.\n\nThe official statement released following the meeting said that the \"season will only return when it is safe and appropriate to do so\", which I suppose is a relief that they've ruled out the safe and inappropriate option.\n\nHowever it happens, I expect Jordan Henderson to get his well-washed hands on the Premier League trophy at some point in the not too distant future. It could easily be July though until the next fixture is played.\n\nAnd hard though it is to plan for anything at the moment, Liverpool will already be well advanced in their planning for next season. Getting to the top is one thing; staying there is even harder.\n\nWho knows what turmoil the current situation is going to cause in the transfer market? But just as the shops will reopen, so too will the transfer window. Players will be bought and sold, especially among the big clubs who should emerge relatively unscathed from the emergency of the epidemic.\n\nJuergen Klopp appears to be contemplating some squad rebuilding: fringe players such as Xherdan Shaqiri, Adam Lallana, and Dejan Lovren have all been linked with Anfield exits and are unlikely to be part of the effort to retain the title in the next campaign.\n\nPersonally, I would keep Shaqiri and think he has been underused. He provides a creative spark and something different while appearing to be both willing and capable of doing so coming off the bench. That's a valuable player to have in the squad.\n\nIt's not only those who regularly find themselves on the bench who might leave. Liverpool's form and success over the past couple of years means that some of their stars are highly prized by other clubs.\n\nSadio Mane is the one I imagine will attract the most interest during the next transfer window. He has been strongly linked with Real Madrid and not surprisingly as he has been Liverpool's most important player this season.\n\nAs Klopp looks to refresh his squad, a large transfer fee received may be deemed worth it. Any bid for the most exciting young talents in Europe such as Jadon Sancho will have to be a large one.\n\nThinking about such moves and the sums of money involved makes it all the more disappointing that Liverpool have placed some of their non-playing staff on furlough so that the government will pay most of their wages during the crisis.\n\nLiverpool can still afford to buy Sancho; they can still afford to pay all of their staff.\n\nCraig Wilkie.

This is down from a year under a policy that came out in 2015 and from an earlier lifetime ban, dating from the height of the AIDS crisis. The shorter deferral period is meant to encourage donations amid a shortage of blood and plasma due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nA Washington Blade reporter asked Trump about the new policy during Friday's White House Coronavirus Task Force press briefing, and the president didn't object to the policy but said it didn't come from him. \"I didn't know anything about that,\" he said, according to the Blade. \"That was done by the FDA, very capable people at the FDA.\"\n\nLog Cabin, which had praised Trump for the easing of restrictions, adhered to that position despite his remarks. \"On March 19, President Trump ordered the 'removal of outdated FDA rules and bureaucracy,'\" Log Cabin Managing Director Charles Moran told the Blade. \"That's exactly what happened when the FDA issued its relaxed guidelines. ... So yes, I stand by my statement that he had a role in this.\"\n\nSince the FDA statement is only a recommendation and nonbinding, some blood banks may choose to keep more stringent regulations, LGBTQ activists noted last week. Activists have also called for a donation policy based on individual risk factors for HIV and other blood-borne infections rather than one based on group identity. All donated blood products are screened for such infections, although there is a period in which recent infections can't be detected.\n\nGLAAD said Trump should have used the Blade's question as an opportunity to urge the adoption of a risk-based policy instead of an identity-based one. \"The inclusion of this issue in such a prominent venue is a signal to the FDA that the LGBTQ community will not stop fighting this ban until all of us can donate blood without restrictions,\" a spokesperson told the Blade. \"Trump could have used this press conference to stand with LGBTQ Americans as well as the leading medical and scientific experts who are now calling on the FDA to end the three month deferral. However, given his poor track record on LGBTQ issues and listening to science, his non-response was disappointing but not surprising.\"\n\nLucas Acosta, national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, also issued a statement on the matter, saying, \"LGBTQ people are not Trump's priority. Never have been, and by every indicator, never will be.\"","744":"Longitudinal changes in DLPFC activation during childhood are related to decreased aggression following social rejection Edited by Susan T. Fiske, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ, and approved March 3, 2020 (received for review August 30, 2019)\n\nSocial rejection can result in negative self-evaluation, and individuals often display aggression for the purpose of self-protection. Regulating aggression after social evaluation in a socially adaptive way is an important prerequisite for establishing and maintaining social relationships. Here, we study the behavioral, neural, and genetic mechanisms of aggression regulation following social evaluation in middle childhood. This developmental phase marks important changes in both brain maturation and developing (online and offline) social relations. Our study showed that longitudinal changes in neural activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were associated with longitudinal changes in aggression regulation. These findings provide insights into how children experience social evaluation and how they control emotions following rejection.","745":"Looking at the 2019-20 Florida Panthers By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy\n\nWith the 2019-20 NHL season on hold we are going to take a look at where each NHL team stands at this moment with a series of posts examining their season.

Having Huberdeau, Aleksander Barkov, Evgenii Dadonov, Mike Hoffman, Brett Connolly, Noel Acciari and Frank Vatrano is a nice luxury. That's a group of forwards that most teams would love to have. So, why haven't the Panthers had much success over the last few seasons?\n\nComing into this season, many expected the Panthers to finish in a Wild Card spot and it's easy to see why. They hired Joel Quenneville, we already talked about their offensive ability and they added free-agent goalie Sergei Bobrovsky for $10 million per season. Still, they found themselves outside of the playoff picture when the NHL went on pause.\n\nThere's a few major issues right now.\n\nFirst, their overall defense hasn't been good enough. Only two Eastern Conference teams (Ottawa and Philadelphia) have given more goals than Florida (280). Offense has spiked over the last couple of seasons, but the truly elite teams are the ones that can shut the game down when they have an advantage. The Panthers clearly can't do that yet.\n\nWhether or not spending $70 million on a goalie works out remains to be seen. Bobrovsky's first year in Florida didn't go as well as anybody expected. At the pause, he had a 23-19-6 record with a 3.23 goals-against-average and a .900 save percentage.\n\nSome of that might be him adjusting to a new team and new city and some of it might be the show quality that his teammates are giving up in front of him. No matter what the reason is, he has to find his game in a hurry if the Panthers are going to compete for a playoff spot this year, next year and beyond.\n\nHighlight of the Season\n\nThere was a stretch of games at the end of 2019 where it seemed like Huberdeau was unstoppable. He put together back-to-back four-point performances on Dec. 16 and 20, and he added another four-point night on Dec. 29 when he dominated the Montreal Canadiens. He accumulated 16 points during that six-game stretch.\n\nHuberdeau probably had the quietest 90-plus point season ever last year, but he's become a household name now.\n\nMORE PANTHERS:\n\n* Panthers' biggest surprises, disappointments\n\n--\n\nJoey Alfieri is a writer for Pro Hockey Talk on NBC Sports.

Goff, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY, and approved February 21, 2020 (received for review December 3, 2019)\n\nLentiviruses encode accessory proteins to manipulate their host cells in order to efficiently replicate and evade antiviral defenses. Interestingly, most lentiviral Nefs down-regulate CD3 from the surface of infected T cells to perturb immune responses. However, for reasons that are incompletely understood, HIV-1 and its simian immunodeficiency virus ancestors lack this function. Here, we report that engineering HIV-1 for Nef-mediated down-regulation of CD3 reduces Env-dependent HIV-1 infectivity, resulting in less efficient cell-to-cell spread and replication. Our data suggest that HIV-1 may have evolved to lose the CD3 down-modulation function of Nef in order to allow T cell activation and to boost viral replication, possibly at the cost of less effective immune evasion and increased pathogenicity.","748":"Lower Key Stage 2 Teacher A top Prep School on the Hertforshire borders require an Lower Key Stage 2 teacher from September, 2020.

The Academy Award-winner appeared on Amy Schumer's podcast 3 Girls, 1 Keith to talk about his early ambitions as an aspiring filmmaker including wanting to adapt the hero to the big screen.\n\nTarantino confessed a Luke Cage film interested him between making Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994). He grew up idolizing the hero having Laurence Fishburne in mind for the role before his friends talked him out of it. \"There was a time before all this Marvel s*** was coming out. It was after Reservoir Dogs. It was before Pulp Fiction and I had thought about doing Luke Cage. Growing up I was a big comic-book collector, and my two favorites were Luke Cage: Hero for Hire, later Luke Cage: Power Man, and Shang-Chi: Master of Kung Fu.\"\n\nAs it turned out, a debate over casting Fishburne and Wesley Snipes ruined his dream project. \"What dissuaded me ... was my comic-geek friends talked me out of it, because I had an idea that Larry Fishburne would've been the perfect guy to play Luke Cage. But all my friends were like, 'It's got to be Wesley Snipes.' And I go, 'Look, I like Wesley Snipes, but Larry Fishburne is practically Marlon Brando. I think Fish is the man.' And they're like, 'Yeah, but he'd have to get in shape in a big way. Snipes is that way already!' And I go, 'F*** that! That's not that important! F-ck you, you ruined the whole damn thing!'\"\n\nTarantino moved on building his own universe stylistically recreating his childhood favorites from filmmakers he followed in his youth. When Cage finally got the live-action treatment, the director didn't think much of the modernization of the character on the Mike Colter-starred series. \"Well, frankly, to tell you the truth, I might be one of the pains in their asses because I love the way the character was presented so much in the '70s,\" Tarantino admitted at the time. \"I'm not really that open to a rethinking on who he was. I just think that first issue, that origin issue ... was so good, and it was really Marvel's attempt to try to do a blaxploitation movie vibe as one of their superhero comics. And I thought they nailed it. Absolutely nailed it. So, just take that Issue 1 and put it in script form and do that.

Now, she not only catches lobster, she also delivers it to customers in the Lunenburg area.\n\n\"We have this list and a trap will come up, and we'll say, 'Oh, that's a five-pounder, that's for Martha.' Some people are very specific about their orders,\" Atkinson told CBC's Information Morning on Monday.\n\nFor her, nurturing a hyper-local market is a way to keep a piece of Atlantic Canada's lucrative lobster fishery chugging along, even as the pandemic shuts down markets in Asia.\n\nAtkinson said taking orders and doing deliveries is definitely more work, but it's paying off -- and not just for her bottom line.\n\n\"I think it's important that we remember .... where our food comes from, so this is a super direct way of getting food from the ocean directly to people,\" she said.\n\nThe seafood industry is an essential service, which means fisheries workers and processors can continue to operate as long as they follow public health orders. Despite calls by processors to close Atlantic Canada's lobster fishery this year, Canada's fisheries minister said Friday that it will remain open.\n\nAtkinson is selling lobster for $8 a pound at the wharf and offering \"contactless\" delivery for customers near Lunenburg.\n\nShe said a couple in LaHave, N.S., celebrating their anniversary recently met her in a Bridgewater, N.S., parking lot to pick up their order.\n\n\"You feel like you're doing something illegal sometimes, but it's a lot of fun. We're actually enjoying it,\" she said with a laugh. \"We have more orders now than what we're catching, so we're getting a bit behind.\"\n\nCommercial fishers can apply for a fish vendor permit through the provincial Department of Environment to sell their catches from the wharf or by delivery.\n\nThe department said it has issued 28 permits since March 16 -- 13 were new permits to sell live lobster, while 15 were renewals.\n\nIn 2019, the department renewed a total of 50 live lobster permits, but didn't get any requests for new permits.\n\nStephen Bond, co-chair of the Lobster Fishery Area 33 advisory committee, is taking the opposite approach.\n\nAbout a week ago, the Chester Basin, N.S., fisher decided to haul up the majority of his traps, although he's kept a handful in the water to feed his family and friends.\n\n\"It's tough because it's not just my family. My crew relies on the boat and the income and stuff as well,\" he said. \"Nobody wants to walk away from doing business and trying to make some money.\"\n\nHe applauds what Atkinson is doing, but said it's not feasible for him given the size of his boat and crew.\n\n\"There's the select few, I'll call them, that are able to follow Gail's model or a smaller business model working with some of the local community, but it certainly doesn't cover off the market that we're missing,\" he said.\n\nHe's among a group of people in the industry who've wanted to see the fishery remain open. Still, Bond said that in some areas of LFA 33, 80 to 90 per cent of boats have voluntarily stopped fishing.\n\n\"With such diverse business models throughout the whole industry, it seemed unfair to close it for people who might have been able to make some money through the spring here,\" he said.\n\nBernadette Jordan told CBC News last week that the federal government is looking at ways to address the collapse of the lobster market in places like Asia by developing markets closer to home.\n\nShe also said that supports such as the Canada Emergency Response Benefit, which opened today for applications, and 75 per cent wage subsidies will help harvesters in the meantime.","751":"Lutsen Resort announces it will close until April 30 DULUTH - Lutsen Resort will close Sunday through the end of April, the latest hit to the hospitality industry that's shutting down amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe popular destination, which overlooks Lake Superior, put about 70 of its 90 employees on unpaid leave, general manager Clair Nalezny said Thursday.\n\n\"It wasn't an easy decision,\" said Nalezny, who said that it was one made with the safety of guests and staff in mind. \"Our intention is absolutely to tighten our belts and reopen.\"\n\nAcross the country, hotels and other tourists attractions are bracing for an economic blow as events and trips are canceled in light of officials' encouragements that the public to hole up at home to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nJust last week, Lutsen Resort was seeing an uptick in reservations as the federal government discouraged travel to Europe, Nalezny said.

The White Sox, stocked with young talent and veteran offseason acquisitions, were expected to take a big step forward in their rebuild this season. Follow along as we play out the first few months of the season.\n\nComing off of a sweep of the Red Sox at Fenway Park, the White Sox returned to Guaranteed Rate Field to take on the cellar dwelling Seattle Mariners, who started their season with a 1-9 record.\n\nThe first inning seemed to look all too familiar for Dylan Cease as he started the game with two hits given up, putting runners at second and third. Cease dug his feet in and battled to strike out the next three batters to get out of the jam. The young righty reached 99 mph on the gun in his daytime start, but was pulled by Rick Renteria with only 85 pitches through 4 1\/3 innings with seven strikeouts and one earned run.\n\nWith the game tied at 1, Renteria went to the pen with Kelvin Herrera, but he struggled once again in relief giving up two runs in the fifth.\n\nThe White Sox lone run came in the bottom of the second when Eloy Jimenez hit a solo homer to left field, his fourth of the season. That extended his hitting streak to nine games. Later in the frame, Nomar Mazara hit a towering shot to center field only to be robbed by Seattle's Dom T-Williams at the wall to end the inning and ultimately the Sox scoring.\n\nThe White Sox did threaten in the ninth with two outs. Edwin Encarnacion forced a walk followed by a Yasmani Grandal single, which extended his hit streak to seven games. With two aboard, it was Jimenez with the chance to create some magic, but he popped out to right field to end the contest and the White Sox win streak.\n\nResult: Mariners def.

If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nPrevious research has produced mixed results concerning cortical representations of taste categories. The main objective of the present study was to test for task- and concentration-invariant maps in human insular cortex through an information-based approach. We tested identical participants in two functional MRI (fMRI) experiments on different days and successfully decoded patterns of fMRI activity associated with each specific taste category in all participants across distinct behavioral tasks and time, suggesting robust task-invariant taste representations in all individual participants. Most importantly, low- and high-concentration taste-preferring representations showed very little overlap, contradicting the notion of an exclusively topological organization in insular cortex based only on taste identity.","763":"Malaysians make own face masks PETALING JAYA: Due to a shortage of surgical masks, washable fabric masks are becoming an alternative for Malaysians.\n\nSome Malaysians have started making fabric masks and distributing them to those in need as well as teaching others how to make them.\n\nDesigner Adam Liew has been making cloth masks and has contributed them for free to three hospitals and also a training centre for special needs.\n\nHe prefers and recommends using poplin cotton fabric when making the cloth mask.\n\n\"Poplin is primarily made from 100% real cotton, making it lightweight but still retaining its strength.\n\n\"The most important for the mask is that it must be made with a double layer with an air-filter, which allows you to replace it with non-woven fabric, antibacterial wet tissues (fragrant and alcohol-free),\" he said.\n\nLiew however pointed out that his cloth masks were not medical-grade or approved by the Health Ministry.\n\nMeanwhile, he said a common misunderstanding was that cloth masks could be made of any type of fabric.\n\nHe said tightly woven fabric was recommended such as plain weave.\n\n\"Examples of plain weave fabrics are calico, taffeta, Habutai silk, viole, cotton shirting and muslin,\" he said.\n\nLiew, who started researching cloth masks in early March, said he created them based on online articles and materials.\n\n\"If anyone with sewing skills would like to explore making cloth masks, I am more than glad to help with my knowledge,\" he said.\n\nSewing studio Maker's Habitat founder Ching Ng meanwhile posted a popular tutorial online on how to sew a washable fabric mask.\n\nHer video on YouTube, which was posted on March 10, now has about three million views.\n\nThe mask in Ng's tutorial has a filter pocket where a non-woven material, which acts as a filter, is inserted and can be replaced regularly.\n\nIn an interview with a regional portal, Ng said the easiest non-woven material would be dried wet wipes or brand new polyester floor wipes.\n\nShe said the cost to make a fabric face mask was estimated at between RM6 and RM7, adding that old cotton clothing could also be used if they were washed beforehand.\n\n\"Anyone with basic sewing skills, even our beginner level students as young as eight years old, can attempt it,\" Ng was quoted as saying.\n\nProf Dr Moy Foong Ming of Universiti Malaya's medical faculty's department of social and preventive medicine had said the government should rethink the use of face masks.\n\nIn a letter to The Star on April 3, Dr Moy said while universal use of face masks should be considered if there was adequate supply, research on the effectiveness of cloth face masks, which were reusable after washing, should be encouraged.\n\nIt was time for the government to make rational recommendations on the appropriate use of face masks to complement other public health measures, she said.\n\nThe Health Ministry has reiterated that only those who are unwell or caring for the sick need to wear a mask.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recently advised the use of simple cloth face coverings in public settings.\n\nThe CDC said cloth face coverings made from household items such as a normal scarf, bandana, hand towel or old t-shirts could be used as an additional, voluntary public health measure while surgical masks should be reserved for healthcare professionals.","764":"Male critical after police-involved shooting in Brampton  A male victim has sustained life-threatening injuries following a police-involved shooting in Brampton.\n\nIt happened on Sawston Circle Monday evening, in the area of Edenbrook Hill Drive and Bovaird Drive.\n\nPeel Regional Police said they responded to a call about shots fired at around 5:20 p.m.\n\nPolice at the scene told CP24 that there was some sort of interaction between police and a man.\n\nPeel Regional Paramedic Services said they found a male victim with life-threatening injuries at the scene.\n\nThe province's Special Investigations Unit (SIU) has been called in to probe the incident.

Beasley was a revelation in his first night as a Timberwolf. He connected on 7 of 13 three pointers for 23 points. His 20 first-half points were the most in a half by a Wolves player in his debut.\n\nIt was Beasley who sent the night into overdrive, connecting on three consecutive threes late in the second quarter to help but the Wolves up by 22 at the half.\n\n\"I was in the zone,\" Beasley said. \"I couldn't see anybody or hear anybody, and it just felt good.\"\n\nBeasley languished in the rotation in Denver, but the Wolves see him as a potential long-term fit for how they want to play. He's a 38% career three-point shooter, and topped out at 40% a season ago. With the Wolves he promises to play major minutes, the most of his career. He played nearly 29 on Saturday.\n\n\"I'm always thankful for opportunities,\" Beasley said. \"I've been putting in the extra work to make sure that they don't regret it. I want to make sure that when I come in, I'm the best player I can be.\"\n\nHe looked pretty good in game one.\n\nIn his locker, Beasley keeps photos of the NBA playoffs logo and the Larry O'Brien Trophy, motivation for his end goal. Even though the Wolves are nine games in the loss column behind the No. 8 seed Grizzlies, Beasley is serious about the Wolves making a playoff run. And he says it with such conviction that you believe him too.\n\n\"We're in a playoff race right now -- 31 games left,\" Beasley said. \"It's not over. I'm pushing to get into the playoffs. Straight up. Shoot for the moon, get stars. If we don't make the playoffs, we ended a great season going into another season.\"\n\nIf Beasley keeps that up, he'll at least help provide an optimistic outlook for the Wolves headed into next fall.","767":"Man dies after being mauled by shark A shark has killed a Queensland parks and wildlife officer during a work trip at the southern end of the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nPremier Annastacia Palaszczuk has paid tribute to the 23-year-old, who died in hospital on Monday night a few hours after he was mauled near North West Island.\n\n\"My understanding is he was employed by the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service,\" the premier told reporters on Tuesday.\n\n\"Once again a family out there is grieving for a young man who tragically has lost his life in this horrific shark attack.\n\n\"A lot of his work colleagues, I understand, were very upset today.\"\n\nThe man was in the water, returning to a charter vessel with others when he was attacked.\n\nPolice have told AAP it was \"not a social swim\", indicating he died in the course of doing his job.\n\nA doctor and paramedics sent to the scene fought hard to stabilise the man so he could be flown to the Gladstone hospital for surgery.\n\nBut he died from leg and arm injuries on Monday night.

Klein, 32, of Chaska was charged in Hennepin County District Court with two counts of first-degree assault on a peace officer and a felony weapons count in connection with the encounter at the retail outlet in the 8000 block of N. Lakeland Avenue, northeast of Interstate 94 and Hwy. 169.\n\nKlein was charged by warrant as he recovers in a hospital from police gunfire to a leg and a hand. No officers were wounded.\n\nHe left prison in August and was under supervised release after being sentenced in 2013 in Scott County for drug, weapons and counterfeiting currency offenses. Klein also has two earlier drug possession convictions in Minnesota and one for fleeing police.\n\nOn Wednesday evening the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) identified the officers involved as Charles Cudd, a 14-year Brooklyn Park department veteran, and Dane Lazenberry, who shot and wounded Klein. Lazenberry has been in law enforcement for five years, including the past year with the department.\n\nAccording to the charges, based on investigation by the BCA:\n\nPolice were called to the store about a suspected shoplifter. Officers also learned that Klein was there buying \"a large amount of ammunition and wearing a holster.\"\n\nCudd spoke with Klein outside the store and ordered him to halt. Klein, instead, walked away and defied the officer's orders. The officer shot Klein with a stun gun, but it \"had minimal effect.\"\n\nKlein began running and then shot at the officer, prompting return gunfire.\n\nLazenberry ran after Klein and shot at him. The suspect pointed a gun at a vehicle in the lot before turning toward the officer \"with the handgun still drawn.\"\n\nLazenberry shot at Klein again, this time wounding the suspect.\n\nPolice recovered Klein's handgun and the ammo belt with numerous rounds of ammunition.\n\nThe suspect \"pulled a gun on me out there and started shooting, and I returned gunfire,\" Cudd told one of his superiors.\n\nThe encounter was connected to a suspected armed carjacking that morning at an Enterprise car rental office in nearby Brooklyn Center, according to emergency dispatch audio.\n\n\"Driver of the car said the suspect pointed a gun directly at her and told her to get out,\" a dispatcher was heard saying. \"She's at home now in Minneapolis.\"\n\nTwo people who were with Klein were briefly detained and released, the BCA said.","770":"Manchester United leading race to sign Jadon Sancho Manchester United are leading the race to sign Jadon Sancho from Borussia Dortmund when the transfer window re-opens this summer.\n\nDortmund are willing to sell Sancho, who turned 20 on Wednesday, and senior figures at the Bundesliga club believe Old Trafford is his most likely destination.\n\nBut the competition for Sancho's signature remains fierce, with Liverpool and his boyhood club Chelsea among those monitoring the situation.\n\nSancho is thought to be keen on playing in the Premier League, having left English football in an \u00a38m move from Manchester City three years ago.\n\nAs part of that deal, City have a first refusal clause on the England international and are able to match any offer accepted.\n\nDortmund are expected to demand a fee of around \u00a3100m for Sancho, who only signed a new contract at Signal Iduna Park in August.\n\nSancho's terms are only due to expire in 2022 but the Bundesliga club have accepted that he is likely to leave since late last year.\n\nUnited are long standing admirers of Sancho, having prioritised him as a target this time last year and explored the possibility of making him a marquee signing last summer.\n\nOle Gunnar Solskjaer has typically favoured signing young or peak-age British players, with Harry Maguire, Daniel James and Aaron Wan-Bissaka joining for a combined sum of around \u00a3140m.\n\nSancho falls into the same category and would represent another high-profile signing, following the January arrival of Bruno Fernandes from Sporting for a fee rising up to \u00a372m.","771":"Marlon James trash-talks dead writers in new podcast A podcast, you say?

The causative bacteria can be found in patients' intestinal tracts days before dissemination, and cohort studies suggest reduced LOS risk in breastfed preterm infants through unknown mechanisms. Reduced concentrations of epidermal growth factor (EGF) of maternal origin within the intestinal tract of mice correlated to the translocation of a gut-resident human pathogen Escherichia coli, which spreads systemically and caused a rapid, fatal disease in pups. Translocation of Escherichia coli was associated with the formation of colonic goblet cell-associated antigen passages (GAPs), which translocate enteric bacteria across the intestinal epithelium. Thus, maternally derived EGF, and potentially other EGFR ligands, prevents dissemination of a gut-resident pathogen by inhibiting goblet cell-mediated bacterial translocation. Through manipulation of maternally derived EGF and alteration of the earliest gut defenses, we have developed an animal model of pathogen dissemination which recapitulates gut-origin neonatal LOS.","777":"Max Kepler makes spring debut as Twins face Red Sox at Hammond FORT MYERS, FLA. -- Another Twins regular will make his spring training debut today when Max Kepler appears in right field today against the Red Sox at Hammond Stadium.\n\nThe Twins have taken it easy with a number of players, including Kepler, who had some back and chest issues slow him down late last season. Not only is Kepler back in the lineup, he's batting in the leadoff spot with Josh Donaldson batting second. Kepler was pretty good in the leadoff spot last season, and there are some who believe you should not mess with what worked.

Last week I wrote that minor league pitcher Charlie Barnes was one of 16 members of his family to get a degree from Clemson. I looked up old info, before three more family members, including his brother graduated. That's 19 from the Barnes clan to go through Clemson. That's impressive.\n\nAs for the other Twins regulars: Marwin Gonzalez, coming off of right knee surgery, should be close to appearing in a game. Jorge Polanco should follow Gonzalez and Byron Buxton after that.\n\nI sense that there will a lot of careful thought as to when to let Buxton play.

In fact, BigDyn is the most potent known endogenous modulator of one such receptor, the acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC), but the mode of action remains unknown. In this work, we employ a broad array of technologies to unravel the details of where big dynorphin binds to ASIC and how it modulates its activity. As both BigDyn and ASIC are implicated in pain pathways, this work might pave the way toward future analgesics.\n\nAcid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are proton-gated cation channels that contribute to neurotransmission, as well as initiation of pain and neuronal death following ischemic stroke. As such, there is a great interest in understanding the in vivo regulation of ASICs, especially by endogenous neuropeptides that potently modulate ASICs. The most potent endogenous ASIC modulator known to date is the opioid neuropeptide big dynorphin (BigDyn). BigDyn is up-regulated in chronic pain and increases ASIC-mediated neuronal death during acidosis. Understanding the mechanism and site of action of BigDyn on ASICs could thus enable the rational design of compounds potentially useful in the treatment of pain and ischemic stroke. To this end, we employ a combination of electrophysiology, voltage-clamp fluorometry, synthetic BigDyn analogs, and noncanonical amino acid-mediated photocrosslinking. We demonstrate that BigDyn binding results in an ASIC1a closed resting conformation that is distinct from open and desensitized states induced by protons. Using alanine-substituted BigDyn analogs, we find that the BigDyn modulation of ASIC1a is primarily mediated through electrostatic interactions of basic amino acids in the BigDyn N terminus. Furthermore, neutralizing acidic amino acids in the ASIC1a extracellular domain reduces BigDyn effects, suggesting a binding site at the acidic pocket. This is confirmed by photocrosslinking using the noncanonical amino acid azidophenylalanine. Overall, our data define the mechanism of how BigDyn modulates ASIC1a, identify the acidic pocket as the binding site for BigDyn, and thus highlight this cavity as an important site for the development of ASIC-targeting therapeutics.","779":"Mechanism of murderous mushrooms paves path for parasitic helminth halt This article requires a subscription to view the full text.

Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\n\"In the animal kingdom, the rule is, eat or be eaten\" (ref. 1, p. 20). We will expand academic Thomas Szasz's statement to include the fungi, because in the multifaceted interactions of fungi and nematodes, this is often a steadfast rule. Indeed, soil systems that appear inert or lifeless to the naked human eye in reality teem with microscopic life dominated by interactions between nematodes and fungi. Numerous free-living Bursaphelenchus nematodes are mycophagous (2), and beetle-associated Pristionchus pacificus has expanded its dietary range to include consumption of fungi in addition to bacteria and other nematodes (3). Parasitic Deladenus nematodes are even commercially used for their mycophagous phase to keep fungus Amylostereum in check; however, the fungus has responded with hyphal invasion through the worms' vulvae (4). Indeed, P. pacificus has also been on the receiving end of predation: Myriad mushrooms have evolved various capabilities to capture worms, often when times are dire and nitrogen contents are low. These predation techniques include adhesive and ring traps that target different nematode developmental stages, such as in the case of Arthrobotrys, a well-studied nematode-trapping fungus (5). Other fungi use infective spores that either bind to the nematode cuticle or are ingested (6). As explored in PNAS by Lee et al. (7), the eatable oyster mushroom Pleurotus ostreatus of the Basidiomycota uses yet another mechanism by employing toxin-induced paralysis to kill its prey. ...","780":"Mechanistic approaches for chemically modifying the coordination sphere of copper-amyloid-\u03b2 complexes This article requires a subscription to view the full text.

Our work presents a mechanistic strategy to modify the coordination sphere of Cu(II) bound to A\u03b2 using a chemical reagent by promoting copper-O chemistry, which can inhibit Cu(II) binding to A\u03b2 and alter A\u03b2's aggregation and toxicity. Our multidisciplinary studies demonstrate a direction for modulating copper-interacting amyloidogenic proteins.","781":"Mechanistic basis for microhomology identification and genome scarring by polymerase theta Repair of chromosome breaks by polymerase theta-mediated end joining (TMEJ) requires short sequence identities in flanking DNA (microhomologies) -- a sequence-context constraint that is unique among DNA repair pathways. Though microhomologies have a central role in TMEJ, it has been uncertain whether an organized mechanism to identify them even exists. Using a combination of chromosomal and extrachromosomal substrates, we describe how polymerase theta efficiently locates microhomologies when present, and creates them de novo when absent. We show how this generates a pattern of microhomology-mediated end joining products that is sufficiently distinct from other end joining pathways and that it can be used as a biomarker for TMEJ activity in cancer genomes.\n\nDNA polymerase theta mediates an end joining pathway (TMEJ) that repairs chromosome breaks. It requires resection of broken ends to generate long, 3' single-stranded DNA tails, annealing of complementary sequence segments (microhomologies) in these tails, followed by microhomology-primed synthesis sufficient to resolve broken ends. The means by which microhomologies are identified is thus a critical step in this pathway, but is not understood. Here we show microhomologies are identified by a scanning mechanism initiated from the 3' terminus and favoring bidirectional progression into flanking DNA, typically to a maximum of 15 nucleotides into each flank. Polymerase theta is frequently insufficiently processive to complete repair of breaks in microhomology-poor, AT-rich regions. Aborted synthesis leads to one or more additional rounds of microhomology search, annealing, and synthesis; this promotes complete repair in part because earlier rounds of synthesis generate microhomologies de novo that are sufficiently long that synthesis is more processive. Aborted rounds of synthesis are evident in characteristic genomic scars as insertions of 3 to 30 bp of sequence that is identical to flanking DNA (\"templated\" insertions). Templated insertions are present at higher levels in breast cancer genomes from patients with germline BRCA1\/2 mutations, consistent with an addiction to TMEJ in these cancers. Our work thus describes the mechanism for microhomology identification and shows how it both mitigates limitations implicit in the microhomology requirement and generates distinctive genomic scars associated with pathogenic genome instability.","782":"Meet Reverie, a resilient vegan cafe with 'mind-blowing' community support The recent opening of Reverie Cafe + Bar (1517 E. 35th St., Mpls.) is less than a debut and more of a reincarnation.\n\nCo-owners Jeffrey Therkelsen and Kirstin Wiegmann started their plant-based restaurant in 2015, moving into a former coffee shop at Nicollet and Franklin Avs. in Minneapolis.\n\n\"We took over someone else's two-year lease,\" said Wiegmann. \"We saw it as an opportunity to get into the game.\"\n\nWhen their lease wasn't renewed, the couple started to search for a new location, but nothing fit their criteria.\n\nThat's when they decided to buck tradition and hit the road with a food truck.

They were terrifying, but they failed to win the war against the Entente.\n\nWorld War I's stalemate on the Western Front ushered up varied solutions. The Allies developed tanks for traversing no man's land to get at the enemy. But tanks had faults: Artillery could stop them, so could mechanical problems and difficult terrain; and they could not get the job done without lots of infantry.\n\nAcross the trenches, Germans had little regard for tanks and produced but few models. The main effort by the Germans lay in the application of the Hutier Taktik, the forerunner of the Blitzkrieg of 1939-1940. The Hutier demanded a narrow front, advancing without regard to the security of the flanks. Follow-up troops were detailed to deal with strong points that had been by-passed. It was an approach that worked well on the Eastern Front, but less so against the entrenchments in the West because the French and British armies were more stable and because the Germans could never amass enough stormtroopers.\n\nGermany Turns to Heavy Artillery\n\nSo from the time of the Battle of Verdun in 1916, the Germans looked to one of their strong suits: their ability to produce very heavy artillery of superlative quality.\n\nRecommended: Why Glock Dominates the Handgun Market (And Better than Sig Sauer and Beretta)\n\nGeneral Erich Ludendorff, head of the Supreme War Council, was approached by naval officers commanding the very heavy guns on the Western Front (in almost all armies, large-caliber railway guns were served and maintained by naval personnel). Their proposal was to introduce guns capable of firing a shell 100 kilometers, or 62 miles. Such guns would require a heavy commitment in funding, materiel, personnel, and technological resources.\n\nLudendorff has been depicted as a cold, reserved officer lacking imagination. But in this instance the man immediately grasped the possibilities. At that time, Paris was only 90 kilometers, or 60 miles, behind the Allied lines and would be vulnerable to such weaponry. It was the hub of the railway network of France. It was the major industrial center of the French armaments industry and, of course, the political capital and administrative center of the French government. Ludendorff recognized an attractive target when he saw it.\n\nHe reasoned that artillery with the capacity to blast Paris might be the German answer to the horrors of the frontal assault. Instead of battering at Allied trenches, punishing Paris would be the means to destroy the heart of France; the rest of the body would wither on the vine. The lesson of Verdun was engraved on the hearts and minds of both sides. Commanders as well as fighting men were increasingly reluctant to launch a frontal assault. Thus Ludendorff was quite taken with the possibility of going over the lines instead of trying to go through them.\n\nDazzled by the proposed technological leap, the projected results of such massive guns were aggrandized, and the ballistic limitations were minimized. All artillery manuals contain \"dispersion tables\" that provide mathematical calculations of the predicted fall pattern of shells. Dispersion is caused by many factors including air temperature and density, temperature of propellant, age of launching explosive, apparent and actual wind over the trajectory of the shell, plus a host of other esoteric variables. In addition, the rule of thumb is that the higher the charge level, the greater the breadth of dispersion. Firing the charge necessary to reach Paris would engender an extreme dispersion factor. It was quite possible to hit a target the size of Paris, but pinpoint accuracy was just not in the cards. Nevertheless, German planners believed that because the French were a volatile people, the effect of Paris coming under artillery fire would be devastating.\n\nDoing the Math\n\nThe assembly of dispersion tables is a laborious procedure requiring a tremendous number of man-hours devoted to calculations, now performed by computers. The amount of labor required to manually assemble dispersion tables is staggering, and the end product is error prone.\n\nDispersion is an accepted factor, and any battery servicing a target has to fire groups of shells to achieve any expectation for a respectable number to be on target. But with such long ranges as anticipated by the proposed massive guns, new complications had to be considered. The Germans would have to take into account the calculations of the French mathematician Gustave Gaspard Coriolis (1792-1843).\n\nCoriolis had been an assistant professor of analysis and mechanics at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, appointed in 1816. He had reached prominence as the result of an innovative paper published in 1815 called Theorie Mathematique des Effects du Jeu de Billards (Mathematical Theory of the Game of Billiards).\n\nCoriolis had codified a basic principle of artillery, which was, \"The angle of reflection is equal to the angle of incidence.\" This proposition had been clearly demonstrated on billiard tables again and again, but extrapolating it to artillery was new. As any billiard or pool table habitu\u00e9 knows, a bank shot leaves the cushion at the same angle at which it arrived. Similarly, an artillery projectile will return to Earth at the same angle at which it left the muzzle.\n\nThis was not the main concern of the Germans, however. After years of diligent research, Coriolis published his true tour de force, Sur les Equations du Mouvement\n\nIn April 1915 the Germans placed extreme-range naval guns on railway mountings. These were named Lange Max (Tall Max) in honor of Vice Admiral Max Rogge, who had supervised the adaptation of naval guns for land use. With a bore of 37.99 cm (14.96 inches), these guns could loft a shell 30 miles. Firing from Lugenboom, shells were reaching Dunkerque, 23.5 miles away.\n\nThe guns were difficult to serve because the loading of a projectile and propellant, with an overall length of eight feet, could only be done from the horizontal position. Loading and relaying the guns for each firing was a labor-intensive, time-consuming project limiting the rate of fire. On the plus side, the guns were immune from direct retaliation. The Allied forces had no ability to deliver counter-battery fire, because the German guns were far out of range.\n\nThe firing site and the target were on an east-west axis, which made the projectiles virtually unaffected by the Coriolis Effect. However, Professor von Eberhardt, an obscure mathematician working for Germany's Krupp steel and weapons corporation, had been working on a method to extend artillery range, and understood the problems that firing on a north-south axis would produce. Eberhardt was a very minor technician, and despite his prestigious \"von,\" his credentials and first name are unrecorded.\n\nKrupp Sets to Work on the Big Guns\n\nLudendorff's approval of the long-range artillery had set the Krupp apparatus into motion. The original specifications stipulated a range of 60 miles, later upped to 75. Krupp, probably the world's most experienced manufacturer of artillery, began to put together such a weapon in its typically innovative fashion.\n\nGun barrels with a 15-inch (38.1-cm) bore were practically an on-the-shelf inventory item. The design team was aware of the barrel erosion resulting from extreme charges and approached that problem in a novel manner. An interior barrel with a bore of 8.26 inches (20.98 cm) would be inserted into the larger bore and would bear the brunt of firing. When worn down by repeated firing, the subcaliber insert could be replaced with relative ease, preserving the exterior barrel.\n\nNevertheless, the work was a major engineering undertaking. The gun was a composite affair, a complex assemblage produced by the renowned Krupp design teams. There was a barrel extension of 36 feet, 1 inch, forward of the original muzzle. On top of this was an additional chase (smoothbore) extension of 19 feet, 8 inches. The entire affair had an overall length of 112 feet, and a weight of 138 tons. Such a ponderous piece of artillery required external bracing to keep the barrel from sagging. Supporting the barrel was a cantilever bracing that transferred part of the load to the base of the gun. The bracing looked very much like a model of one-half of the Brooklyn Bridge. Obviously this apparatus could be carried only on railroad wheels and required the special construction of reinforced trackage.\n\nThe shell was to weight 229 pounds and was to be of novel design. Instead of using conventional copper driving bands, it would have two steel ones threaded to fit into the barrel's rifling. Behind each driving band was a narrow copper band to act as an obduration (sealing) device. The loading drill required it to be screwed into the rifling. This mandated muscle power, and lots of it.\n\nKrupp engineers calculated how much metal would be worn away from the insides of the barrels with each firing. They determined that the service life of the barrel was 64 rounds before rebuilding would be required. To compensate for such wear, the shells were numbered consecutively and incrementally sized to compensate for the predicted erosion. Shells had to be fired in numerical order to preserve the fit of the projectiles in the increasingly worn barrel.","785":"Meet universal basic income's unlikely Bay Area evangelist Gisele Huff is convinced universal basic income is finally having its moment. The 84-year-old French native and San Francisco resident is the president of the Gerald Huff Fund for Humanity, a nonprofit that promotes universal basic income as a solution to economic inequality.\n\nWhile Huff's organization is only a few years old, it has already made its mark in the Bay Area. Santa Clara County's Board of Supervisors is considering a pilot program that would provide youth exiting foster care with a basic $1,000 monthly income. If approved later this year, the program would likely be the first of its kind in the nation. It is also the product of Huff's advocacy: She persuaded Supervisor Dave Cortese to explore the idea in Santa Clara County.\n\nHuff is an unexpected convert to the cause. She survived the Holocaust with her mother by hiding in Southern France; 18 of her relatives were killed in concentration camps. They immigrated to the U.S. in 1947. Huff became a secretary, then earned a PhD in political science from Columbia University, and spent most of her career working in education and development. She became interested in UBI through conversations with her son, Gerald Huff, a Tesla engineer who worried about technological unemployment. In 2018, Gerald died from pancreatic cancer and Huff founded the Fund for Humanity the following year. She sat down with this news organization to discuss her vision for making basic income mainstream and how her advocacy carries on her son's legacy. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nQ: Can you tell me about how you became an advocate for UBI?\n\nA: In November of 2018, my son Gerald died of pancreatic cancer at age 54 after being diagnosed seven weeks before. Incredibly, his father died of pancreatic cancer when he was 54 years old, 32 years before that. So it was devastating. And [Gerald] had converted me from being a libertarian with the advent of 2008 when the economic system went awry. People lost their homes, their cars, couldn't send their kids to college. I realized that what I had been able to achieve, coming to the U.S. when I was 11-years-old with my mother with $400 to our name, that who I am is the American Dream. And I realized that it was no longer available.\n\nQ: And your son was concerned about those same issues? How did he come to his perspective on UBI?\n\nA: Gerald was the software engineer for the Model 3 Tesla. So he has been a techie all of his life and what really spurred him on to look into this in a deeper way was his fear of technological unemployment. The robots are coming. And the potential of that technology is what Gerald was aware of -- it's immense.\n\nGerald passed away in 2018. And I began doing due diligence on UBI. I knew a number of people in the UBI world that Gerald had introduced me to, who connected me to other people in the field. And I looked at who was doing what. All the organizations were doing was writing and talking. They weren't doing anything. So when that was clear to me I started the Gerald Huff Fund for Humanity.\n\nQ: Different people have different ideas about what exactly UBI should look like. What's yours?\n\nA: It would be $1,000 a month and it runs like social security. It's an automatic system. All you need is a bank account. So UBI is a direct payment to your bank account on a monthly basis. It has no requirements. When you're 18 it starts and it goes on until you die.\n\nQ: And everyone would get the same amount? Including the wealthiest households?\n\nA: Yes. For the people who are wealthy, it will disappear because $1,000 doesn't mean anything. But it will mean the world for the people who are so marginalized now, like foster kids or abused women who can't leave a situation because they don't have a dime to their name. It is a huge incentive for people to move on, to do things, take risks that they would not do before.\n\nQ: Some critics of UBI say that it could incentivize people not to work, because no matter what they do they will get a monthly paycheck. What is your response?\n\nA: If you have a job, you're not going to stop working for $1,00 a month. What you're going to do is you're going to tell your boss: \"No, I'm not doing this because it's not acceptable and I have $1,000 dollars that I can use for the next two months until I find a better job.\" So if you want that job done as a boss, you're going to have to improve the conditions or the pay.\"\n\nQ: Thinking about the challenges in the Bay Area, do you see UBI as something that could play a role in addressing housing and homelessness?\n\nA: Well, homelessness is a very big deal here. I think a number of people become homeless because they can't afford the rents. And those people who are janitors or policemen or nurses who we need in the city, if they have to commute for 2.5 hours one way that's five hours of stress. And we need them! If the janitors didn't come for two weeks Google would have to close down. That has value. It goes back to the philosophical underpinning of the UBI: The idea that we all contribute. And with $1,000 extra a month maybe they can move closer to their jobs.\n\nQ: Finally, what do you think Gerald would say if he could see the momentum around UBI right now?\n\nA: He would be...shocked. He would be amazed. [Voice cracking.] I can't put words to what his reaction would be to what i'm doing. He would be flabbergasted. I'm flabbergasted.\n\nGisele Huff\n\nTitle: President of the Gerald Huff Fund for Humanity\n\nAge: 84\n\nResidence: San Francisco\n\nEducation: Undergraduate at Hunter College and Columbia University, where she graduated with a PhD in political science.\n\nPast positions: Director of development at San Francisco University High School and executive director for the Jaquelin Hume Foundation.\n\nFive things to know about Gisele Huff\n\nShe was born in Paris, France.\n\nShe is Jewish, and 18 of her relatives were killed in concentration camps during World War 2.

It was also the then-23-year-old artist's first release with her label, 1501 Certified Entertainment.\n\nTwo years and one chart-topping record later, the contract she signed is the subject of pending litigation -- and of her newest album. The Houston artist, n\u00e9e Megan Pete, sued 1501, claiming that it had been blocking her from releasing new music. Now 25, she contends that the contract she signed while \"young and naive\" is financially exploitative and creatively restrictive. But this month has been a good one for her so far. A Texas judge granted her a temporary restraining order against the label and its CEO, Carl Crawford; the order was extended Friday. (For his part, Crawford has denied all of Megan's allegations.) And last week, Megan released Suga, an eclectic nine-track EP on which she flouts 1501's control through her defiant lyrics. While Megan's broader legal battle is ongoing, these smaller triumphs are encouraging -- not just for her, but for other artists in the industry too.\n\nMany rising musicians, especially young women of color, have had their careers hindered by arrangements similar to Megan's, in which a label wields near-total control while giving musicians paltry sums. Megan's complaints echo those of artists such as the singers Kelis and SZA. The Oakland rapper Kamaiyah, too, recently released Got It Made, the first mixtape put out by her new independent label, which follows years of delays that Kamaiyah endured while signed to Interscope Records. Still, Megan's degree of candor -- especially since she remains signed to her label -- is comparatively rare. Beginning with an Instagram Live broadcast on March 1, in which she first spoke publicly about her dispute with 1501, the rapper has been startlingly transparent about the particulars of her financial arrangement with the label.\n\nSuga continues Megan's offensive, albeit in musical form. Already rebellious by virtue of its existence, the EP begins with a reclamation of Megan's story. The rapper opens the first track, \"Ain't Equal,\" with reminders that she hasn't been thwarted by recent tragedies, including the death of her mother, who was also her manager. \"Ain't Equal\" is also a thinly veiled dare to 1501, and to Crawford specifically. All three verses end with references to Megan's self-determination: \"Bitch, I been popping, doing numbers, been lit \/ And since the nigga think he made me, tell him do it again,\" she raps at the end of the second verse. The third closes with a similarly unsubtle shot at Crawford: \"Niggas tryna get some fame off my name, that's a shame \/ When I started making money, that's when everybody changed, huh.\" The lines recall the frustration that pulses through Kamaiyah's \"Still I Am,\" the Got It Made single on which she raps about prevailing over her past contract woes: \"Fuck all the bullshit, I done earned these stripes \/ For all of them days I lived on my dime \/ And the labels didn't spend, I'm back on my grind.\"\n\nElsewhere on Suga, Megan tries to strike back through her artistry. \"Captain Hook,\" the third and most impressive of Suga's songs, packs an onslaught of wordplay into less than three minutes. In one breath, the rapper ties an R-rated invocation of the inspirational 2004 dance film You Got Served to a delightfully vulgar reinterpretation of the titular Peter Pan character. (The first time I heard the lyric, my jaw dropped -- and then I immediately replayed it.) \"Captain Hook\" is Megan at her peak, a fast-paced paean to her own sexual and lyrical prowess. Each word lands hard, and the rapper knows it. The \"Ain't Equal\" producer Helluva Beats joins forces with Megan again on \"B.I.T.C.H.,\" the January single that seemingly addressed the sexist vitriol she's received: \"I'd rather be a B-I-T-C-H (I'd rather keep it real with ya),\" she insists in the chorus, \"'Cause that's what you gon' call me when I'm trippin' anyway.\"\n\nMegan's hardly new to cursing, or to pointing out the double standards that women must face, but some of Suga's most audacious moments diverge from her usual repertoire. On \"Hit My Phone,\" the singer Kehlani joins her for a slower, more sentimental spin on the rapper's sultry themes. As on Tina Snow's \"Cognac Queen\" and Fever's \"Big Drank,\" Megan channels a woozy, liquored-up sound, even when she's delivering straightforward raps rather than crooning. Reminding a man that he's lucky to be in her presence, Megan never loses her bite -- \"Hit My Phone\" is, after all, a command, not a request. But even with the surprising addition of Kehlani's syrupy vocals, Suga isn't all sweet: Some of the later tracks, which find Megan shifting toward an almost leaden singing style, lack the rigor and sharpness of the prior songs.\n\nWhether future court hearings go in her favor or not, Megan's fight to release Suga now -- and the fan support she has generated -- may lead to a more equitable contract. Ideally, that'd account for artistic development that doesn't drain her resources as dramatically as her current contract, which stipulates that Megan must pay producers and other collaborators out of her cut of the profits. That clause only underscores 1501's seeming disinterest in supporting its own artist by helping her refine her craft. Indeed, some of those gaps show up on the EP, which at times feels rushed -- a disappointing but unsurprising result for a work that also comes less than a year after the high-octane rollout of a full-length project. Even with these moments of weakness, though, Suga is still an achievement for the rapper.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

Having now realised that it referred to their new comedy, Hitmen, and having now seen the show in question, I am only marginally less perplexed.\n\nMel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins play hapless assassins Jamie and Fran.

At one point, they agree to pull him to safety and give him a 10-second head start to run away. You're almost disappointed when you don't hear the words: \"On your marks, get set, escape!\"\n\nAnd this is precisely the problem. Mel and Sue just don't seem to be acting. Their voices, facial expressions and mannerisms all mirror what they do in their presenting work and comedy skits, meaning there's no chance of being immersed in their imaginary world at all.

The first episode sees the slayers waiting around for instructions on what to do with the bloke locked in the back of their van. They get up to all sorts of inane antics in the intervening hours: a trip to a McDonald's drive-thru, charades (never mind all the killing, the pair's most heinous crime is wasting this perfect opportunity for good physical comedy), donning party hats (because it's Sue's birthday! So silly!), and meeting a rival assassin who also happens to be Sue's crush.\n\nMaybe there'll be some emotional depth, I hear you cry, in the absence of much to laugh about? Alas, the closest we get to this is a conversation with the aforementioned hostage who, thinking he's about to die, tells the killers: \"Everyone ends up doing stuff they're not proud of. In the end, the most important thing is that the people who know you accept you for who you are.\" But it just hangs in the air and amounts to nothing, like a drooping tower of choux pastries.\n\nAll that said, Hitmen serves its purpose if you're looking for escapism from the relentlessness of reality.

The mechanism of the hierarchical structures on suppressing crack advance under reciprocating movement is poorly understood. Tough and self-healing hydrogels are good candidates as simplified model systems for studying the mechanical behaviors of load-bearing biotissues. Here, we report that polyampholyte hydrogels, having a hierarchical structure, demonstrate high fatigue resistance through a synergistic effect between different scales. Such an antifatigue mechanism based on hierarchical structure not only gives important hints to understand fatigue-resistant behavior of biotissues with complex hierarchical structures, but also provides design strategy for tough and fatigue-resistant hydrogels, by forming multiscale network structures using noncovalent bonds as building blocks.","789":"Metabolic and genetic basis for auxotrophies in Gram-negative species Edited by Ralph R.

Applying metabolic control analysis in vivo, we show that the regulation of insulin-stimulated hepatic glycogen synthesis under both normal and pathophysiological conditions of fatty liver-associated hepatic insulin resistance is controlled at the glucokinase (GCK) step through GCK translocation.\n\nMultiple insulin-regulated enzymes participate in hepatic glycogen synthesis, and the rate-controlling step responsible for insulin stimulation of glycogen synthesis is unknown. We demonstrate that glucokinase (GCK)-mediated glucose phosphorylation is the rate-controlling step in insulin-stimulated hepatic glycogen synthesis in vivo, by use of the somatostatin pancreatic clamp technique using [C]glucose with metabolic control analysis (MCA) in three rat models: 1) regular chow (RC)-fed male rats (control), 2) high fat diet (HFD)-fed rats, and 3) RC-fed rats with portal vein glucose delivery at a glucose infusion rate matched to the control. During hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia dose-dependently increased hepatic glycogen synthesis. At similar levels of hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, HFD-fed rats exhibited a decrease and portal delivery rats exhibited an increase in hepatic glycogen synthesis via the direct pathway compared with controls. However, the strong correlation between liver glucose-6-phosphate concentration and net hepatic glycogen synthetic rate was nearly identical in these three groups, suggesting that the main difference between models is the activation of GCK. MCA yielded a high control coefficient for GCK in all three groups. We confirmed these findings in studies of hepatic GCK knockdown using an antisense oligonucleotide. Reduced liver glycogen synthesis in lipid-induced hepatic insulin resistance and increased glycogen synthesis during portal glucose infusion were explained by concordant changes in translocation of GCK. Taken together, these data indicate that the rate of insulin-stimulated hepatic glycogen synthesis is controlled chiefly through GCK translocation.","791":"Metabolic-electrical control of coronary blood flow The heart is a metabolically demanding organ with limited energetic reserves to sustain its monumental workload. An efficient blood supply via the coronary vascular network is therefore critical for maintaining efficient cardiac muscle function. The coronary vascular network originates just above the aortic valve, where the right and left main coronary arteries connect to the ascending aorta. These arteries branch out into smaller-diameter arterioles that connect to capillaries, where oxygen exchange takes place (Fig. 1). In PNAS, Zhao et al. (1) describe a signaling pathway in the heart that couples metabolic changes in ventricular myocytes to hyperpolarization of capillary endothelial cells (cECs). This hyperpolarizing signal rapidly propagates throughout the arteriolar tree, causing vasodilation. The resulting upstream vasodilatory response is necessary to increase blood flow during periods of cardiac muscle metabolic stress to match oxygen supply with metabolic demands. The physiological implications of these findings are described below.\n\nA central tenet in cardiac physiology is that oxygen extraction efficiency is almost at saturation in the coronary circulation (2). Increasing oxygen demand is rapidly matched by increased blood flow via changes in perfusion pressure or vascular ...","792":"Mic, then movie: Ice Cube plays Soundset while prepping N.W.A. biopic (and 'Barbershop 3') The hip-hop icon and movie star said of his performance at Sunday's festival at Canterbury Park, \"School is in session.\"\n\nIce Cube knows where he stands among younger fans coming to Sunday's Soundset hip-hop festival: Many know him more from saccharine Hollywood movies such as \"Are We There Yet?\" than from bitter and incendiary landmark rap albums such as \"Straight Outta Compton\" and \"AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted.\"\n\nTurns out he actually kind of likes it that way.\n\n\"School is in session,\" he said in his unmistakably stern voice. \"I have 60 minutes to show them why I still do hip-hop and what I've meant to hip-hop. I want them to get the full picture of who Ice Cube really is.\"\n\nThe whole world is about to learn or relearn the gritty origins of the rapper-turned-actor come August, when the much-ballyhooed movie on Ice Cube's old group N.W.A. lands in theaters, already riding a wave of hype and controversy.\n\nTitled \"Straight Outta Compton\" after the quintet's groundbreaking 1988 debut, the N.W.A. biopic is the pet project of Cube and fellow alum Dr. Dre.\n\n\"I've been very hands-on as a producer ever since my first one, 'Friday,' but with this one I'm hands and feet on,\" he said proudly. \"This is the most important movie of my career, even though I'm not starring in it. It's very personal.\"\n\nCube himself (O'Shea Jackson, 45) proved personable and quite funny at times when he called last week from the set of \"Barbershop 3\" in Atlanta. He's squeezing in Soundset and a Detroit club gig while filming is on break over the holiday weekend. As if he doesn't have enough to do.\n\nQ: When and why do you decide to do rap gigs like this?\n\nA: I love performing. I'll never get that out of me. It actually makes a lot of sense for me to do shows like this right in the middle of filming a movie, because it keeps my energy level up. Shooting movies can feel a little stagnant.\n\nI get freedom out of hip-hop, too. I get to be a true artist without any shackles or harnesses. The movie industry is one big collaboration. Music gives me that freedom to create things straight from my heart and my mind.\n\nQ: Are you surprised Minnesota now has one of the biggest hip-hop festivals in the world with Soundset?\n\nA: Not at all. To me, Minneapolis has always been a live town. My first time coming in to play First Avenue was a big deal. I saw the movie [\"Purple Rain\"] when it came out in 1984. I had been a big Prince fan from Day 1. I've always been intrigued by the scene there because of him. I loved the Time back in the day, too. So for there to be a good hip-hop scene there now is not a surprise.\n\nQ: We've been expecting a new record from you since you dropped the single \"Everythang's Corrupt\" two years ago. What's the holdup?\n\nA: What happened was \"Straight Outta Compton,\" the movie. I commanded all my attention toward making it perfect. I wanted to be fair to the movie and to the record, and I couldn't do that by trying to do both projects at the same time.\n\nQ: For people who aren't fans of N.W.A., why is that a story that deserves to be made into a movie?\n\nA: It's a story about standing up for yourself, about courage, about David vs. Goliath, about freedom of speech, about being yourself, about taking a negative and turning it into a positive. Even though we talked a lot of gangsta [expletive], hip-hop made it so that talking was all it was. We didn't have to go out there and kill nobody, rob nobody. We rapped about it.\n\nWe turned our negative energy into something positive, which was to make a record.\n\nQ: How much correlation do you see between N.W.A.'s music and the issues faced today in Ferguson, Mo., and Baltimore?\n\nA: This movie is so timely with what's going on today, and with the protests around the country. It feels like it's full-circle. Twenty-five years later, the same topics are still troubling us. So this movie needs to come out. It's a perfect time for this movie to come out, and for people to understand that not enough has changed. A lot has changed, but not enough.\n\nQ: Your son [O'Shea Jackson Jr., 22] plays you in the movie. How well did he nail the part?\n\nA: He's a chip off the old Cube, that's for sure. He's [expletive] great. I mean it. He really was the best guy for the job. We auditioned people. We had to. A studio as big as Universal is not going to just let you put your own people into a movie. He had to do the screen test and everything. They had to believe he was the best guy for the role. I knew he was.\n\nQ: Does your son still go around imitating you, like for laughs at family barbecues?\n\nA: No, but I've caught him wearing more Raiders [football] gear than he used to.\n\nQ: You came out of the N.W.A. gate running with your solo debut \"AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted,\" which just marked its 25th anniversary. What do you think its legacy is?\n\nA: To me, it was the Panama Canal of records. It showed that East Coast and West Coast could be one hip-hop nation. It showed that no matter what part of the country you come from, you can always come together to make groundbreaking hip-hop.","793":"Michael Clarke: Aussie stars 'sucked up' to Virat Kohli to protect million-dollar deals Former Test captain Michael Clarke says Australian cricket stars \"sucked up\" to Virat Kohli and India to protect their million dollar IPL deals, causing our cricket to become \"soft\".\n\nSpeaking on Big Sports Breakfast, Clarke said Australian cricket went through a phase when players were too scared to sledge Indian stars for fear it could jeopardise their contracts in the lucrative T20 competition.\n\nSettle in with the best entertainment for the whole family.

I thought that was the case, but it has changed for sure. As I said, in the heat of the battle you want to be competitive but I've been proven wrong.\n\n\"The thing I said before the first Test, that has certainly changed and you won't hear me say that ever again.\"","794":"Michael Vick a Hall of Famer? Lamar Jackson thinks it's a no-brainer, the numbers say otherwise Lamar Jackson thinks Mike Vick should land in Canton, but we're not so sure\n\nMichael Vick's Hall of Fame candidacy was brought to the limelight on Monday thanks to Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson, who looked like the second-coming of the former Falcons star and even surpassed his NFL rushing record during his MVP season in 2019. Jackson re-tweeted a post on social media asking if Vick should be enshrined in Canton on the first ballot. This question is somewhat relevant as Vick is now eligible to be a member of the Hall of Fame class starting in 2021.\n\nTo that question, Jackson posted this response below illustrating that, in his mind, it's a no-brainer.\n\nWhile Vick certainly was a transcendent player and quite possibly had Hall of Fame caliber talent, Jackson appears to be on the wrong side of this argument. Michael Vick is not a first ballot Hall of Fame quarterback and likely won't be enshrined at all.\n\nThere are currently 28 quarterback that have busts in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Out of those signal callers, Vick would have the fourth fewest yards and only outgun quarterbacks Sammy Baugh (1963 inductee), Sid Luckman (1965) and Rob Waterfield (1965). Vick's 133 career passing touchdowns would be the second fewest of this group and would only edge Waterfield, who played from 1945-1952. Of course, Vick's rushing ability did separate himself from the rest of his contemporaries. His 6,109 career yards on the ground would be the most among the Hall of Fame quarterbacks and his 36 rushing touchdowns would rank fourth-most out of these greats.\n\nThose rushing stats alone, however, likely won't get him in. Vick was never listed as an All-Pro, never won an NFL MVP award and has no Super Bowls to his name. In the playoffs, he owns a 2-3 record as a starter and completed just 56% of his throws in those games. He's also just ten games above .500 as a starter during the regular season.\n\nThere's also the dog fighting incident from 2007 that saw Vick receive a 23 month prison sentence and a coinciding two-year ban from the league that could also become a factor in Vick failing to reach the Hall of Fame. If the voters factor in Vick's off-the-field troubles into their decision similar to how baseball's Hall of Fame invokes a \"character clause,\" it'd be hard to imagine Vick being able to overcome that.\n\nWhile it may seem like we're piling on, we're just illustrating that the stats -- along with off-the-field issues working against him -- are simply not there to make a realistic case for Vick to enter Canton. For a moment, Vick did appear to be on a Hall of Fame trajectory with the Falcons, but the arrest and subsequent prison sentence derailed that potential.\n\nStill, Vick is remembered as one of the most electrifying players the NFL had ever seen and has left his mark on a league today that is littered with quarterbacks that are more mobile than ever. As we saw with Lamar Jackson this past season, Vick's impression on the NFL is extremely apparent. The end of his football story, however, just won't end with a bust in Canton.","795":"Microsoft Hires Ex-Apple Exec in Charge of Wireless for Hardware Microsoft Corp. hired Apple Inc.'s former executive in charge of wireless technologies to work on mixed reality hardware and artificial intelligence technology.\n\nThe Redmond, Washington-based technology giant appointed Ruben Caballero to a role as a corporate vice president, according to his LinkedIn profile.

He has worked on many Java EE projects. His roles have included lead developer, systems analyst, business analyst and consultant. Gilbert graduated from from California State University in Los Angeles with a Bachelor of Science degree in Business.\n\nIn this article, we will demonstrate how to migrate an application from Java SE 8 to Java SE 13.\n\nOracle began a six-month release cadence for Java Standard Edition starting with Java 10. Instead of being major version releases, they are instead \"feature releases\". This release cycle is in the spirit of Continuous Integration \/ Continuous Deployment and will benefit many projects, as they can be upgraded to the next release with less risk and fewer code changes. Although many projects have been developed with the newer versions, Java 8 SE is still the most used version.\n\nSince Oracle stopped supporting Java 8 in January of 2019 (except for businesses that have a commercial license) now may be a good time to migrate your applications to Java 11 (the latest release that provides Long Term Support) or to a later Java release. (Or you may just want to take advantage of the new language features available in later releases.) Java is a very backward compatible language and in general, requires little or no effort to upgrade your application. If your application uses Java technologies that have been removed from Java SE (e.g. Java EE modules) or older third-party libraries, additional steps may be required.\n\nIn this article, we will demonstrate how to migrate an application from Java 8 to Java 13.\n\nStart by downloading the Java JDK 13 from the Oracle website. https:\/\/www.oracle.com\/java\/technologies\/javase-jdk13-downloads.html\n\nNext, follow the instructions in the Installation Guide from the Oracle website. https:\/\/docs.oracle.com\/en\/java\/javase\/13\/install\/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A\n\nIn this example, we will use a trivial SOAP-based web service to demonstrate the issues you may encounter when migrating a Java 8 application to Java 13 and how to address them. Note that this application was developed using the latest version of Java 8 SE available here: https:\/\/www.oracle.com\/java\/technologies\/javase-jdk8-downloads.html\n\nOpen pom.xml. You will notice that the project is using the Maven compiler plugin at version 3.8.1 for building the project and that it is configured to use Java 8. Let's change it to use Java 13. Modify the and elements as follows:\n\nSave the changes and select Maven->Update Project from the project context menu. Select your project from \"Available Maven Codebases\". Leave the other defaults and click OK.\n\nAt this point, you will see many errors in the Markers view stating that several variables, types, imports and annotations cannot be resolved. This is because the following technologies and packages were removed in Java SE 11:\n\nOther technologies and packages were removed as well:\n\nThere may be options available to resolve missing JEE module issues, depending on how your application is packaged. For instance:\n\nThis will add JAXB and JAX-WS APIs as external libraries in the project. We also added the JAX-WS runtime library to the project.\n\njaxws-rt contains the JAXB runtime. If you wanted to use JAXB only you can use the following dependencies:\n\nIf your application uses third-party libraries, you may have to use an updated version of the library that supports JDK 13. Our sample application does not use any third-party libraries.\n\nSave the file. Maven will download the required libraries and the project will be recompiled. Consequently, the compile errors will get resolved.\n\nClick the Run button. When the application starts, you will see the list of all illegal reflective access operations:\n\nHere we are specifying that the package from module will be accessible to all code in the classpath. You can specify that only a specific module can access the package for finer-grained control by replacing with a specific module name. (Since this is a small application, there is no real need to modularize it.)\n\nLet's suppress all the warnings for our application. Right-click and select Run as > Run configurations... and select the (x)= Arguments tab. In the VM arguments text box, replace the current contents with and click the Apply button.\n\nClick the Run button. The application will start and all warning messages will be suppressed.\n\nThere is an Eclipse plugin tool named \"IBM WebSphere Application Server Migration Toolkit\" that can help identify migration issues. (Note that this tool does not depend on any application server for our specific purpose.) Let's see how we can use it to analyze our project.\n\nStart by installing the toolkit. Select Eclipse Marketplace... from the Help menu and search for \"IBM WebSphere Application Server Migration Toolkit\".\n\nOnce installed, right-click the project and select Software Analyzer -> Software Analyzer Configurations... (If you followed the previous steps, you will need to delete the project and re-import it as we need to start with the Java 8 version of the application.)\n\nClick OK. This will automatically select the relevant rules in the Analysis Domains.\n\nIf you want to learn more about a specific rule, select it from the list and click the help button (the question mark in the lower-left corner of the window). In the Help section, click on Detailed Help.\n\nClick the Apply button and click the Analyze button.

I blogged about the possibilities of a Minneapolis energy disclosure almost a year ago, and as a licensed Truth-In-Sale of Housing Evaluator, I received training with the official details of this program last week. My office has been receiving a lot of questions about this new requirement, so here are the details. For those who prefer video format, here's that: Video explanation of Minneapolis Energy Disclosure.\n\nEvery Truth-In-Sale of Housing (TISH) Evaluation will now include an Energy Disclosure Report. This applies to one- and two-family dwellings, townhouses, and first-time condo conversions. The most notable part of this disclosure will be the overall energy score, with a rating from 0 - 100. The metrics of this program make it possible for any old home to achieve a score of 100 without the owner having to spend a ridiculous amount of money. Hopefully.\n\nThe energy score will have four key areas:\n\nI don't know how all of this is weighted just yet, so I don't know what it will take to achieve a score of 100. I'm sure we'll figure that out soon enough.\n\nThis report will include additional information about the home, such as the number of stories, year built, square footage (based on city records), square footage of the attic area (based on data collected onsite), and whether the heating system is more or less than 20 years old.\n\nThe report will also include recommendations on what can be done to improve a home's energy score. The City of Minneapolis also offers 0% financing to residents that complete energy upgrades. Utility rebates may also be available. To contact an Energy Advisor for more information about basically anything related to this program, call 651-328-6225 or email energyadvisor@mncee.org.\n\nThere will be no required upgrades or energy improvements as part of this program. If your home scores a 2 out of 100, that's fine. You don't need to fix anything. The idea is that the next person buying your home will care about the energy score, and they'll take steps to improve it.\n\nAgain, home sellers and home buyers won't have to make any changes to a home based on the energy score. There's no pass or fail. It's just information.\n\nYes, the rumor is true. Part of this program will require us to drill a two-inch hole at an exterior wall, from the interior. This will be done to determine the type and depth of insulation in the wall. Whatever we find at that location is what we'll assume the entire house has.\n\nIdeally, this hole will be drilled in an inconspicuous location like the inside of a closet or under a kitchen sink. To help make it less noticeable, it's also supposed to be drilled low down on the wall. If there are any additions to a home, this hole should be drilled at the original part of the house, not the new part.\n\nAfter a hole has been drilled and the insulation type and depth verified, the opening in the wall will be covered with a plastic plug like the one pictured below.\n\nThe good news is that homes built after 1980 don't need to have this done. Also, if you've had an energy audit performed on your home by the Home Energy Squad within the last five years, you won't need to have an energy audit performed at your home. Be aware, however, that they drill a hole too. And rumor has it they're booked out about six months. As of Dec. 26, 2019, they are booked out approximately one month in Minneapolis.\n\nPeople keep asking about us drilling holes in houses. I keep telling people that we're not drilling holes. Just a hole. I'm thinking of calling this program the... ah, never mind.\n\nNobody wants a hole in their wall, but this isn't optional. To anyone who plans to take a hardline stance against the city on this matter, I'll share with you some parenting advice that my mom once shared with me: pick your battles. You can appeal to the city, but a valid reason is not \"I don't want a hole.\" You'll need something more compelling, and I have no idea what that would be. And you'll probably lose.\n\nThere are inconspicuous places to drill at just about every house I've ever been to. While people seem to be in an uproar over this, I don't think it'll be as big of a deal as people are making it out to be. I admit, I was a bit whipped up about this earlier on in the year, but I've gotten past it. This will all be fine.\n\nTo help avoid surprises during the TISH evaluation, we're planning to send out an email to our Minneapolis TISH clients who book with us. We'll let them know about the hole, and we'll recommend they choose the location of the hole for us and mark it with tape. We'll also ask our clients to sign a form saying they understand this, and we will not conduct the TISH evaluation if we're not given permission ahead of time.\n\nBefore we drill a hole, we'll likely use a Walabot Wall Scanner to check for studs, wires, and pipes hidden in the wall. I did a video demonstrating this device at the beginning of this year; check out this video clip below for that.\n\nWhen we drill, we'll be sure to only drill deep enough to get through the drywall or lath and plaster; we won't go boring through the wall.\n\nHopefully, doing all of these things will help to keep problems to a minimum. But we'll see.\n\nMinneapolis TISH evaluations currently take about an hour on-site and we charge $200 for single-family homes. We're guessing that these additional requirements will initially double our time on-site. With a bit of practice and repetition, however, we're hoping for these additional requirements to only add about thirty minutes of time. With that in mind, we're planning to increase our fee for Minneapolis TISH evaluations to $300 beginning January 15th.\n\nIf you have a valid TISH evaluation that was performed before January 15th, 2020, then you don't need an energy disclosure report to list your home for sale. TISH evaluations are good for two years. If you're planning to sell your Minneapolis home anytime in the next two years and you don't want to have an energy evaluation performed with your TISH, then now is the time to get one done.\n\nFor a list of FAQs about this program and a sample report, click the following link: TISH Energy Disclosure FAQs & Sample Energy Report.\n\nFor a candid discussion of our thoughts on the whole program, check out last week's home inspection podcast on this topic.","803":"Minneapolis' Nomad Pub is for sale (for a lot of money) For sale: One historic West Bank Minneapolis watering hole that's popular with soccer lovers and music fans. Asking price: $1 million.\n\nAds for the Nomad World Pub suddenly popped up on Zillow and other real-estate sites this week, and then showed up again all over Facebook on Tuesday as patrons feared for its future.\n\nThe sales pitch in the ad calls it a \"rare opportunity to own an iconic bar.\" It goes on to say, \"The operation is profitable and has numerous opportunities to increase the annual revenue. The Nomad is the place to be for a diverse and robust clientele through its programming of nightly live music, bocce ball leagues, World Cup soccer, Zombie Pub Crawls, trivia etc.\"\n\nSo what gives, then, if it's such a great place?\n\nOwner Todd Smith -- who took over the former Five Corners Saloon space in 2005 and became a torchbearer for the sometimes troubled neighborhood -- declined to comment on the specifics of why he put the pub up for sale. However, he said there's no eminent, pressing reason to unload it, and he hopes it would wind up in the hands of a like-minded bar owner if it is sold.\n\n\"I love the Nomad and am proud of what we've done here,\" Smith said. \"Now, I'm interested in knowing if anyone wants to carry on with what we started.\"\n\nSmith recently took over another old saloon space with a lot of character and renovated it, the Country Bar in Uptown's Lyn-Lake area, which reopened in April. However, he said that the new old bar has nothing to do with his plans at his older old bar. The Nomad is close enough to the soon-to-open U.S. Bank Stadium that the new Vikings palace might be considered another selling point for it.\n\nCoincidentally or not, the Viking Bar is about to reopen. Another old watering hole on the West Bank that closed in 2005 just as the Nomad was opening up, the Viking has new owners who finally took down the \"Gone Fishing\" sign and are now renovating the place. They reportedly have solid plans to restart the live music offerings there in the coming months.","804":"Minnesota Poll finds Gov. Tim Walz's job approval at 56% More than half of registered voters in Minnesota approve of the job Democratic Gov. Tim Walz is doing after his first full year in office, a Star Tribune\/MPR News Minnesota Poll found.\n\nFifty-six percent of those surveyed gave Walz a favorable review, while a quarter disapproved of the governor's performance. His marks are on par with former Gov. Mark Dayton's average approval rating during his eight years in office.\n\nRespondents demonstrated clear preferences on a couple of leading controversies confronting Walz, with overwhelming opposition to copper-nickel mining near the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and a slight majority in favor of marijuana legalization.\n\nPeople's spending priorities were more mixed. About one-third of Minnesotans said that if state spending increases, lawmakers' top priority should be prekindergarten through 12th grade public education.\n\nEducation spending is likely to be a significant issue at the State Capitol in the current legislative session. Walz and House Democrats have cited early education and school lunches as priorities for any surplus budget dollars. And a proposed constitutional amendment aimed at closing the state's racial achievement gap has gained traction in the Legislature, though lawmakers have expressed reservations about the legal consequences.\n\nHealth care was a close second for spending priorities, with 29% of respondents saying that should be where the state should devote additional dollars. Republicans were most likely to want any additional spending to be targeted at health care. Democrats and independents were inclined to name K-12 education as their preferred spending focus.\n\nLike many Minnesotans, Larry Sarver of Albert Lea describes himself as somewhere in the middle of the political spectrum. Health care would be his top priority for additional dollars. Around Thanksgiving, Sarver, 73, had a heart attack.\n\n\"I've got insurance, but it's still going to put a helluva burden on me,\" said Sarver, who wants politicians to scrap the Affordable Care Act and work together on a replacement.\n\nTransportation was the third most cited spending priority in the poll, with 14% of Minnesotans naming it as a top priority. A.J. Sonquist of Crystal is among them. As an exterminator, he spends his days driving to serve clients and knows how bad the state's roads can be.\n\n\"We need to invest both in roads and transit. I think we're just way far behind,\" he said. Sonquist, a Walz supporter, said the governor's idea of increasing the gas tax is long overdue, though he said Walz's original 20-cent-per-gallon proposal may have been too high of a starting point.\n\nFor Linda Loucks of Bovey that gas tax plan was one of the big reasons she opposes the job Walz is doing. Her family has run a bait and tackle shop for more than 70 years in the cabin country near Grand Rapids. Low gas prices are critical for their business, she said, noting that more people travel north to fish when it's cheap to fill up.\n\nLoucks has two sons working in mining at the Hibbing Taconite plant. She was among the minority of poll respondents who said they support building new mines near the Boundary Waters in northern Minnesota, which she said would bring back areas \"beaten down\" by the loss of mining. The majority of people polled -- 60% -- said they generally oppose building new mines near the BWCA, while 22% supported the idea and 18% were undecided.\n\nThe Star Tribune\/MPR News Poll was conducted Feb. 17-19 and included 800 registered Minnesota voters. Its margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\nThe poll found Walz -- who represented a wide swath of southern Minnesota in Congress before he was elected governor in 2018 -- had the lowest support in southern Minnesota. While 65% of voters polled in Hennepin and Ramsey counties gave him favorable reviews, just 47% of southern Minnesota residents approved of his job performance. A little more than half of the residents of metro suburbs and northern Minnesota liked the job he was doing.\n\nWalz's support was clearly split along party lines. He had a 78% favorability rating among Democrats, although another 19% of DFL voters said they were unsure how they felt about his job performance. Among Republicans, Walz had a 31% approval rating, somewhat higher than Dayton's 20% favorability among Republicans at the end of his last term.\n\nPeople who categorized themselves as independents or had political allegiances outside the major parties gave Walz decent marks, with 56% supporting and one-quarter disliking the job he was doing.\n\nSarver, who had described himself as somewhere in the middle of the two parties, was frustrated by Walz. He would like the governor to rein in state spending and is frustrated by continuous tax increases. He also wants to see reform in education spending and raises in teacher pay.\n\nLast year Walz and the politically divided Legislature passed a $48 billion two-year state budget that increased per-pupil education spending by 2% each year. This legislative session, the governor proposed long-term borrowing of $447 million for state colleges and universities in his public construction package. The money would pay for building maintenance and improvements at campuses across the state.\n\nSonquist, whose wife works in higher education, supports the additional dollars Walz is trying to devote to schools, including the college systems.\n\n\"I just think he's got his head in the right place,\" Sonquist said. \"He wants to help and wants to treat everyone with equality.\"","805":"Minnesota Poll: Voters split on Trump heading into 2020 election A slim majority of Minnesota voters hold a negative view of President Donald Trump with eight months to go until the general election, according to a new Star Tribune\/MPR News Minnesota Poll.\n\nStatewide, 52% of voters disapprove of Trump's job performance, while 44% approve of his work in the White House. But those views did not translate into direct support for the Democratic-led effort to impeach and remove the Republican president from office. Half of voters said they disapproved of the impeachment proceedings, while 42% favored it.\n\nThe president's latest approval ratings mark a slight improvement from an October Minnesota Poll, when the president's approval rating dipped to 40%. Fifty-six percent of voters held negative views of his tenure at that time.\n\nThe new results come as the president ramps up his campaign to win Minnesota, which would make him the first Republican to do so since 1972. The campaign, which already includes dozens of paid staff across the state, has vowed to spend heavily to win the state, which Trump narrowly lost to Democrat Hillary Clinton in 2016. Minnesotans are sharply divided along partisan, gender and geographic lines, the poll showed. The president enjoys his strongest support among men and those with no college degree.\n\nAmong men, 49% approve of the president's time on office, but only 40% percent of women hold the same view. Half of those with no college degree approve of the president, but just 39% of college graduates approve.\n\nAmong Republicans, 92% approve of Trump's performance, while 97% of Democrats disapprove of his time as president. Independents were more evenly split, with 48 % holding a negative view of the president and 44 % viewing his work in a positive light. The telephone poll of 800 registered voters was conducted Feb. 17-19 and has a margin of error of +\/-3.5 %\n\nIn Hennepin and Ramsey counties, seven in ten voters disapprove of Trump's performance. But in the metro suburbs, which are expected to be heavily targeted by both parties this November, 54 % voiced approval. The president's support was strongest in southern Minnesota, where nearly six in ten voters approve of his performance. Voters in northern Minnesota were evenly split, 48% to 48%.\n\nThe president got higher marks for his handling of the economy and jobs, which is emerging as a central theme of his re-election pitch. Half of the voters polled said he is doing a good job in that area, while 43 % disapproved. The poll registered strongest support on the economy in the metro suburbs and southern Minnesota, where six in ten voters approved of his work.\n\nChristina Meyer, a real estate agent from Shakopee who voted for both Republicans and Democrats in the past, credits the president for the strong economy. She was initially drawn to Trump because he offered \"something different from what we've had in there the last seven and eight presidents.\" Now, she says, a booming economy and low interest rates are fueling home sales.\n\n\"People feel empowered, they just feel more confident right now,\" she said. \"People work so hard, all of us work hard, so to see a strong economy is good.\"\n\nKaden Kremin, a Trump supporter from the southwestern Minnesota town of Tyler, also cited the economy as a factor in his support. The 19-year-old, who works as a support aide for people with disabilities, said job prospects have improved since Trump took office. He also likes the president's brash communication style.\n\n\"He's pretty straightforward with what he says,\" he said. \"I enjoy that he doesn't really have a filter.\"\n\nMinnesotans' views on the president's handling of national security and foreign policy were less positive statewide. A slim majority -- 52% -- said the president's actions have made Americans less safe. That number rises among some voter demographics seen as key for the upcoming election, including women and voters under 34. Nearly three in four voters in Hennepin and Ramsey counties said they believe the president's actions have led to increased risk.\n\nMinneapolis' Peter Wilson said he believes the nation is \"far and away less safe\" under Trump. The 77-year-old retiree worries the president's actions, including the order to halt direct military aide to Ukraine at the center of the impeachment case, send the message to allies that they \"can't rely on us unless they placate Trump personally.\"\n\n\"He governs by fear and division,\" said Wilson, who plans to vote for a Democrat this November. \"He's vindictive and petty and none of that helps to run a country because a country is all the people, whether you like them or not.\"\n\nSupport for congressional Democrats' effort to impeach the president has fallen since October. A Minnesota Poll conducted weeks before the House voted to formally authorize proceedings found that Minnesotans were evenly split, with 47% of voters approved of the idea.\n\nNow, in the wake of the U.S. Senate's voted to acquit the president, 42% of voters think impeachment was a good idea. Half were opposed. Views break sharply along party lines: 94% of Republicans were against the effort and 86% of Democrats supported. it. About six in ten independents said they opposed impeachment.\n\nWilson, the Minneapolis retiree, said Congress had a legal and constitutional obligation to bring forward the articles of impeachment based on the president's conduct. But he worries the process was \"ineffective and will be turned against\" the party on the ballot this November.\n\n\"They were following their conscience and the law, but they didn't have the country united behind them,\" he said of Democratic lawmakers.\n\nKevin Sawier, a 41-year-old marketing professional from New Hope, called the president a \"walking, talking example of why we should have limited power at the federal level.\"\n\n\"He continues to embarrass himself with his public demeanor,\" he said. \"He does things without any regard for a consistent political philosophy or the betterment of the country.\"\n\nSawier, an independent who leans libertarian, wants to see Trump out of office. But he didn't think the president's conduct in regards to Ukraine rose to an impeachable offense. He'd rather have voters decide themselves this November.\n\n\"To me, it's something that should be resolved by elections,\" he said.","806":"Minnesota Twins at midseason: The present and future are one The Twins are nine games over .500 at the All-Star Break and have a four-game lead in the race for a Wild Card berth. They just finished a run against three serious playoff contenders with eight victories in 11 games. On Sunday, the Twins took apart Detroit (for the third time in four games) with a lineup that included five players who spent time in the minor leagues this season.\n\nThings are good. Unexpectedly good.\n\nSo good that it's perfectly fine, with more than 50 percent of the season played, to talk about the Twins as a postseason contender without sounding silly. And one of the good things about that discussion is that it no longer breaks off into an argument over whether the Twins are playing for today or building for the future.\n\nThose two things, right now, are pretty much one.\n\nAnd there isn't very much \"in spite of\" on the roster right now. Sure, you can pick on Mike Pelfrey right now for his problems in recent starts, but I want you to find another American League team that has a fifth starter who doesn't concern its manager. And for all the tweaking on him that we've done, it's only fair to point out that Joe Mauer has a .325 batting average and .835 on base-plus-slugging percentage (OPS) over the last three weeks.\n\nAbout the only thing you'd want from the Twins right now is a bullpen upgrade, the kind that should be able to get done in the next few weeks without giving up much in return. (That's not giving up Oswaldo Arcia for a set-up guy. It is taking on a reliever or two who could boost the bullpen in return for second-line prospects or the always popular \"cash considerations.) In other words, the Twins should be looking for the kind of deals they've been making over the last few years when getting rid of players who didn't fit into their future.\n\nNow, on to the things we didn't expect or had cause to wonder about:\n\n*The starting pitching. Kyle Gibson is pitching like a boss, Tommy Milone is pitching like a steal (Milone for Sam Fuld? Remember that one last summer?) Phil Hughes has been OK instead of outstanding and Ervin Santana should make the rotation better in the way that Trevor May, even though he didn't deserve the demotion, makes the bullpen better. If you have to be queasy over Pelfrey right now, that's a small price for what the Twins are getting from the others.\n\n*The outfield is no longer a liability. If you use the Fangraphs team Ultimate Zone Rating statistics, the Twins have an outfield team UZR of -0.4, which is right in the middle of the majors. That doesn't sound impressive, but consider two things: A portion of the season was played with an assortment of weak combinations (Escobar-Nunez\/Schafer\/Hunter, for example) before the current group took over most of the innings. Also, in 2014, the team outfield UZR was -36.2, which was 29 of 30 teams. Here's a definition of UZR, if you need it.\n\n*Torii Hunter is on more than a retirement tour. Except for his batting average, his offensive statistics are comparable (or even a bit better) than in recent seasons. I thought Hunter's arrival was a marriage of convenience, but it has turned out to be a vital bridge between what the Twins were and what we expect them to become.\n\n*Brian Dozier is showing that if more than half of your hits (54 percent right now) are for extra bases, it renders batting average (and even on-base percentage) pretty unimportant.\n\n*Aaron Hicks is showing what happens when you get third or fourth chances. Although we shouldn't be totally convinced, he's in the process of trying to prove that he's more than a fourth outfielder as the Twins look at their future. His minor-league batting statistics make it a little odd that everyone started looking at him as a potential defensive replacement type of player at best. Having to choose among Hicks, Byron Buxton, Eddie Rosario and Oswaldo Arcia for three starting outfield spots in the future isn't a bad thing.\n\n*The front office and Molitor have made the right moves at the right time: Bringing up Rosario before the other young players was greeted with skepticism, and turned out to be the right move. The Hicks situation was odd but is working. If Miguel Sano's promotion was delayed a couple of weeks, that's hardly a crime. (I think he would have been promoted in June, except for the Kennys Vargas game-winning home run against St. Louis that may have kept him around a bit longer.) The shortstop juggling act has kept Santana from facing too much pressure or the Eduardos from being asked to do too much. The main takeaway is that the Twins are no longer filling their roster with guys who have little reason to be on a major league roster - the Matt Tolberts and Brian Dinkelmans of the world.\n\n*Molitor is the right combination of old school and contemporary in his managing. The smartest leaders don't tell you everything that's going through their minds. Molitor answers queries about strategy and personnel moves without full disclosure but with enough detail to let people know what's going on. I hope that doesn't change over time. Some moves haven't worked out (in-game pitching decisions come to mind) and the Twins' base-running right now is curiously inconsistent. To me, that's a sign of a work in progress. Mistakes are made over 162 games - and maybe you're noticing more of them because you care that much more.\n\nThat's my list. If you look at the projections from Baseball Prospectus and others, the Twins are still an underdog for the postseason. There's understandable skepticism that the Twins will continue their current pace - or even play .500 baseball from now until October. That's a price to be paid for four years of wasteland baseball. I'm choosing to be impressed that the Twins are 49-40 despite a couple of stretches when you could wonder whether things were going to go from bad to worse. Instead, they straightened themselves out.\n\nFour days without baseball has been a blessing in recent years. In 2015, the way things have been going, Friday's resumption of play can't come soon enough for Twins fans.","807":"Minnesota advocates seek to abolish subminimum wages for people with disabilities Minnesota would become the fourth state in the nation to prohibit employers from paying people with disabilities less than the state's minimum wage, under a proposed measure that would phase out the decades-old practice by 2024.\n\nThe legislation, which passed a state House committee this week, would force dramatic changes at approximately 100 centers across the state, known as sheltered workshops, that benefit from a loophole in federal labor law that allows them to pay people with disabilities based on their productivity, rather than a fixed hourly rate. In many cases, their pay amounts to just cents an hour for basic tasks, such as packaging merchandise, scrubbing toilets and shredding paper. These state-subsidized workshops, which provide a broad range of support services, employ nearly 10,000 people with disabilities -- among the most of any state, according to Minnesota workforce officials.\n\nThe practice of paying subminimum wages began in the Great Depression as a way to give people with disabilities a chance to learn job skills. But in recent years, the practice has come to be seen as discriminatory, exploitative and a violation of civil rights under the landmark Americans with Disabilities Act. A Star Tribune investigation in 2015 found that many of those in Minnesota's workshops spend years toiling in poverty and isolation with little hope for advancement. A growing number of cities and states have banned or restricted the practice of paying sub\u00adminimum wages, in the hope of integrating thousands of people with disabilities into the general workforce at competitive wages. Two states, Oregon and Rhode Island, have been forced to shutter workshops under legal settlements with the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nParents defend workshops\n\nProponents of the legislation maintain that a gradual phasing out of subminimum wages would enable the state to avoid costly sanctions and would give state workforce officials and families time to develop alternative employment options in the community. \"Everyone deserves to earn a minimum wage,\" said Jillian Nelson, policy advocate for the Autism Society of Minnesota. \"But we can't just kick people to the streets.\"\n\nStill, the measure faces vigorous opposition from many parents of people with significant intellectual and developmental disabilities, who fear their adult children will lose support services and have nowhere to go if the local workshops close. In many smaller towns, these parents maintain, the workshops -- sometimes called \"day activity centers\" -- are the only option for community engagement and employment. In some rural communities, workshops are also the primary source of transit, shuttling people to and from work and activities in the community.\n\nThey also provide a vital source of social interaction for people who would otherwise be stuck spending their days at more isolating group homes, parents maintain.\n\nAt a contentious legislative hearing Wednesday, a number of parents spoke passionately in defense of the workshops and cautioned against hasty action that would force them to close.\n\n\"Working for less than minimum wage is a choice,\" said Dawn Kovacovich, a retired educator from northern Hubbard County. She has a 28-year-old daughter with autism who attends a day activity center in Park Rapids. \"If we take away that choice without first providing an alternative, we are destroying the quality of life for thousands of people.\"\n\nAnita Maloney, a 23-year-old with an intellectual disability from southern Minnesota, exemplifies the challenges many young Minnesotans with disabilities face as they seek mainstream employment at competitive wages.\n\nGregarious and energetic, Maloney sought work soon after graduating from a vocational training program after high school. She landed a job bagging groceries at a Hy-Vee supermarket in Owatonna, but Maloney discovered she could not handle the routine heavy lifting.\n\nSoon after, she went to work busing tables at the Kernel Restaurant in Owatonna, a job she liked. But after a couple of months, Maloney was told the restaurant did not have a position for her, which left her feeling dejected, she said.\n\n\"I was really, really -- I mean, how would you say this? -- proud of working there. Very proud,\" Maloney said of the restaurant job. \"I was sad when they said it was not a good fit.\"\n\nLacking other options, she now goes every weekday morning to a sheltered workshop in Owatonna where she does light assembly work. Twice a week, she and others at the center travel in a van to a Hormel plant in Austin where they assemble cardboard trays for cans of Spam. She is paid on a \"piecework\" basis, which means her income is based on the quantity of trays she assembles every hour.\n\nIn a productive week, Maloney can make as much as $200. But on days when she does not go to Austin, she said she often has nothing to do except play with puzzles and talk to others at the center.\n\nMaloney said she hopes for a regular job one day, perhaps at a veterinarian clinic or animal rescue center. At the same time, she fears losing the friends she's made at the local workshop. \"I think I'm going to stick where I'm at right now,\" Maloney said. \"I have friends here, and there are nice people to be around.\" Still, she said of her time at the workshop, \"I do get bored. I mean, really, really bored.\"\n\n'Sweatshops'\n\nOverall, researchers have found the more segregated the workplace setting, the lower the earnings and the lower the quality of life. In a 2018 state survey of people with disabilities, those who reported earnings from workshops in Minnesota made a mere $63 a week, compared with $150 for those who held competitive jobs in the community. They also reported lower levels of participation in the broader community, the survey found.\n\nAlex Jaffe, 32, who has Asperger syndrome and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, said he was required to attend a sheltered workshop in Eagan for nearly two years as a condition of his stay at an adult foster care home. At the workshop, Jaffe did menial tasks such as placing zip ties in plastic bags and sorting cereal boxes.\n\nSometimes when orders were slow, he said, workers would be asked to undo packages and repeat work that had already been done, which he found demeaning. Jaffe said he was typically paid between $100 and $200 a week.\n\n\"Sheltered workshops are an industry that is built on the blood and sweat of a vulnerable population,\" said Jaffe, who now works as a security guard and stand-up comic. \"They are essentially sweatshops in our backyard.\"\n\nNo one asked them\n\nFor decades, state officials in Minnesota had little knowledge about the thousands of people in sheltered workshops, their aspirations and how they ended up there. That began to change with the 2014 passage of the federal Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. The law required that young people be evaluated for regular work in the community before being steered to subminimum-wage labor.\n\nIn addition, the law mandated that the state vocational rehabilitation program or its representatives meet face-to-face with adults 25 and older in sheltered workshops at least once a year to gauge their interest in pursuing regular jobs at competitive wages.\n\nIn 2019, staff interviewed 9,900 people with disabilities in workshops across the state. Of these, 1,635 people, or 17% of the workshop population, indicated they were interested in competitive work in the community, according to the state Department of Employment and Economic Development.\n\n\"We have a huge population of people for whom it was just assumed that they didn't want to work in the community -- but no one had even talked to them,\" said Noah McCourt, a disability rights advocate and former employee of a sheltered workshop.\n\nThe proposed legislation calls for a task force to develop a plan to phase out payment of subminimum wages in Minnesota by Aug. 1, 2024.","808":"Minnesota church is base of 100-year-old Kurdish relief project The nonprofit Lutheran Mideast Development is one of the state's oldest global initiatives.\n\nA West St. Paul church is the unlikely U.S. base of operations for a 100-year-old project helping Kurdish people in the war-torn Middle East.\n\nOver the years, Lutheran Mideast Development has helped families and children in refugee camps and urban neighborhoods where displaced Kurdish families have settled. Today that is primarily in Turkey.\n\nAmong its projects are scholarships to allow Kurdish girls to remain in school, vocational education for teens and adults, and training of social workers to help families in refugee camps.\n\n\"And the men who started this were from Minnesota,\" the Rev. John Snider, of St. Stephen's Lutheran Church, told a group of supporters at a recent informational event about the project. \"That's the amazing thing.\"\n\nThe nonprofit is one of the state's oldest global initiatives. It was launched in 1910 by the Rev. L.O. Fossum of Red Wing and the Rev. M.O. Wee of Luther Seminary in St. Paul as a missionary project of the U.S. and German Lutheran churches.\n\nOver the years, the group -- then known as the Lutheran Orient Mission Society -- worked with Kurdish communities in Iraq, Iran, Syria and Turkey, depending on political winds and needs.\n\nWhat started as missionary work morphed into humanitarian aid work, demonstrating Christianity in action rather than overt conversion, members said.\n\nToday the nonprofit reports that it donates about 50 scholarships each year in the Istanbul neighborhood it works in. It trains about 250 women annually in sewing, weaving and textile work at another location near the Iranian border.\n\nAnd along the Syrian border, about 60 women are trained each year to be social workers for refugees grappling with their next steps in life.\n\nIt's all done on a shoestring budget -- about $250,000, according to the nonprofit's 2018 tax returns -- using a model of developing the talents of local residents to work within their own communities.\n\nAlthough the nonprofit buys and distributes items such as blankets, shoes and family-sized tents for Kurds in crisis, it relies less on material aid than on scholarships and training for longer-term impact, Snider said.\n\nLutheran Mideast Development operates with about 30 full-time field staff in several locations in Turkey, plus another 15 or so volunteers, staff said.\n\nThe Rev. Morris Wee, a Lutheran minister from the Twin Cities, was among the people listening to the report of Lutheran Mideast Development's work. A longtime board member, he is the grandson of the minister who traveled 100 years ago to what was then the far-flung world of Kurdish communities to preach the word of Christianity and help those caught in wars and poverty.\n\nThe nonprofit has experienced periods of growth, and periods of limited engagement, over the century, Wee said. He believes his grandfather would be both proud and surprised that it has survived and still thrives in the year 2020.\n\nBut the turn-of-the-century missionary was a minister of his era. When asked what he thought his grandfather would think about the project today, Wee said: \"He'd probably ask how many people have been baptized.\n\n\"But we don't proselytize,\" Wee said.\n\nThe group's decades of work become an important symbol of reliable friendship and support, Snider said, even as the U.S. broke off military partnerships with the Kurds in northern Syria last fall.\n\nAnd a development model created decades ago continues to serve the people, Snider said. He added: \"We're offering hope, not despair.\"","809":"Minnesota confirms five more cases of chronic wasting disease, including one wild deer Five new cases of chronic wasting disease were confirmed Friday in Minnesota, including one of a wild deer in Dakota County. It's the first evidence the disease has spread to the Dakota County area, about 100 miles northwest of the state's hotbed for CWD in Preston, Minn.\n\n\"We're hopeful the disease is not widespread in the area,\" said Lou Cornicelli, DNR wildlife research manager.\n\nThe deer was reported by a resident near Farmington. The DNR will establish a management zone at least 15 miles surrounding where it was found. The agency will likely increase the number of hunting permits and extend the season in that area to thin the herd. Restrictions will be put in place on moving deer carcasses from the area and mandatory testing may be ordered. The DNR is also developing plans to sample deer until the fall hunting season, Cornicelli said.\n\nThe regulations will mirror those the DNR put in place in Crow Wing County after CWD was allowed to fester on a state-regulated deer farm for more than two years before it likely leaked out and infected a wild deer.\n\nTest results also confirmed that the fatal neurological disease was in four deer from a Pine County game farm. The deer were destroyed early this year after two others from the same farm were found to be infected. All nine deer on the farm have now been killed and tested, according to the Minnesota Board of Animal Health.\n\nThe board, which regulates the state's roughly 370 deer farms, has declined to release the location and the name of the deer farm to the public, saying only that it is in Pine County. The farm sold an infected deer to a Douglas County deer farm late last year. The board has not disclosed the name or specific location of that farm either.\n\nThe owners of both game farms will not be allowed to keep any deer or elk on the sites for five years, a board spokeswoman said.","810":"Minnesota faces federal sanctions for low child-care subsidies State faces millions in penalties for chronic underfunding of program.\n\nMinnesota could be forced to pay millions of dollars in penalties starting this fall for violating federal regulations designed to ensure access to affordable child care for poor families, state officials warn.\n\nAfter years of underfunding, Minnesota's state subsidies that help more than 15,000 low-income families pay for child-care costs have fallen well short of federal standards and the cost of providing care, forcing some providers to turn away children and leaving working parents scrambling to find arrangements to stay employed. The state's publicly funded child-care assistance program now covers just 16.3% of the full tuition charged by family providers and 23% of prices at larger child-care centers, which is below the federal minimum for reimbursement rates, according to a report issued this week to lawmakers by the state Department of Human Services (DHS).\n\n\"We are at a critical point,\" said Lisa Bayley, deputy assistant commissioner for children and family services at the DHS. \"Everything shows that having that consistent, stable, quality child care, day after day, is critical for kids' development and for keeping families together.\"\n\nChild-care advocates and some lawmakers say Minnesota's low reimbursement rates for publicly funded day-care costs have contributed to a severe and worsening shortage of options for low-income families, particularly in greater Minnesota. Statewide the number of family child-care providers has declined 35% over the past decade, from 12,200 providers in 2009 to less than 8,000 last year. Approximately a quarter of Minnesota families live in \"child-care deserts,\" in which there are more than three times as many children as available spots among licensed providers, according to a recent analysis.\n\nMinnesota's reimbursement rate for its publicly funded child-care program has not increased since 2014, as repeated pleas for additional funding have been drowned out by concerns over fraud and poor oversight of the Child Care Assistance Program (CCAP), a $254\u2005million program funded through state and federal dollars. Unless lawmakers raise the subsidy, the state will lose from $2.75\u2005million to $5.5\u2004million of the $69\u2005million it receives annually through a federal block grant to help with CCAP costs. Minnesota would be subject to penalties as of Oct. 1, according to DHS officials.\n\nThe looming possibility of federal fines has fueled bipartisan calls for legislation that would bolster payments under the child-care assistance program. Sen. Karin Housley, R-St. Mary's Point, chairwoman of the Senate Family Care and Aging Committee, has introduced a bill that would set CCAP reimbursement rates at the 25th percentile of a market-rate survey of costs, which would bring Minnesota in line with minimum federal standards. Even with such a change, however, CCAP payments would not come close to covering costs at most day-care providers. Lawmakers have proposed rate increases in each of the past five years, none of which were approved.\n\nThe chronically low rates leave day-care providers with just a few options to stay afloat -- none of them favorable. They can refuse to serve low-income families using the CCAP program; limit the number of such families they serve, thus restricting access; or charge poorer parents a portion of the difference between the CCAP reimbursement rate and the tuition for child care. Parents who can't afford the difference are often forced to turn to family and friends for help. In some cases, they drop out of the workforce to take care of their children at home, say operators of child-care centers.\n\nThose especially hard-hit are minority families, which make up a majority of the people in the child-care assistance program. As of last year, more than 67% of the 30,000 children served in the program were children of color or American Indian, state data show. The average monthly subsidy for families in the program was $1,356.\n\n\"Right now, the economics simply aren't sustainable,\" said Clare Sanford, director of government and community relations at New Horizon Academy and board member of the Minnesota Child Care Association. \"If we can't make child care more accessible for low-income families, then providers won't go into the business and they won't stay in the business.\"\n\nKaren Devos operates the only child-care center in Norman County in northwestern Minnesota, with the nearest competitor roughly 40 miles away. About a quarter of the 49 children at her center, in the town of Ada, Minn., population 1,700, have a portion of their costs subsidized through the state child-care assistance program.\n\nTo avoid turning away low-income families, Devos has dipped into her own income, forfeiting a paycheck for three consecutive years. But with three children and household costs of her own, Devos said she cannot continue to subsidize such losses indefinitely, and she will be forced to set limits on the number of children on CCAP that she can accept if rates do not increase.\n\n\"I will do everything in my power to serve a family in need, even if that means taking a pay cut,\" Devos said. \"But something has to give, or else people will either go out of business or quality will fall away.\"\n\nAt the New Horizon Academy child care center on Penn Avenue in north Minneapolis, where more than 90% of the families are receiving public assistance, the financial strain has been even more dire. There currently is a gap of more than $4,000 a year between what the center charges in tuition and what it collects in CCAP subsidies per child. Spread over a classroom of a dozen infants, that gap amounts to more than $50,000 a year.\n\nFor now, New Horizon Academy has kept the center in north Minneapolis afloat by spreading its costs among the other 80 centers in its network, Sanford said.\n\nBayley, the deputy assistant commissioner at DHS, said the low CCAP rates have a \"cascading effect\" throughout the child-care system, limiting what providers can pay staff and contributing to higher churn among employees. The financial pressures are one reason the industry has been steadily shrinking; last year alone, another 988 family child-care providers shut their doors. \"It's just had this one-two punch,\" Bayley said of the low CCAP rates. \"It affects the families themselves who currently need child care, and also the number of child-care providers out there.\"\n\nThe federal Administration for Children and Families first notified the state last April that it was out of compliance with its reimbursement requirements, and it would be subject to financial penalties if rates were not increased. Around the same time, the administration of Gov. Tim Walz recommended increasing rates to bring them in compliance with federal law, at a projected cost of about $100 million through 2023.\n\nBut concerns over access to affordable child care were overshadowed last spring by reports of rampant fraud in Minnesota's child-subsidy program. A widely publicized television news report suggested that Minnesota refugee families were defrauding the program and funneling illegally obtained money overseas to fund terrorist groups. That report was never substantiated, but an ensuing report by the Office of the Legislative Auditor, the state's top government watchdog, found that the DHS had inadequate controls to detect and prevent fraud in the CCAP program.\n\nAfter fierce criticism from lawmakers, the agency has taken steps to shore up its system for tracking and responding to reports of fraud, and it imposed tougher penalties on providers found to have bilked the child-care program.","811":"Minnesota teen world's youngest recipient of bionic arm Request to Vatican to investigate Archbishop Nienstedt in limbo A new type of bionic prosthesis -- aided by a surgery that reassigns nerves in the arm -- has made a big difference to the 13-year-old from Westbrook, Minn.","812":"Minnesota writer David Treuer on National Book Award long list Writer David Treuer, who grew up on the Leech Lake Reservation in northern Minnesota, is one of 10 writers on the long list for the National Book Awards in nonfiction.

Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nThe agents that inhibit mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are reported to have antineoplastic efficacies; however, their impact on immune cells is not clearly defined. We identified that genetic loss\/inhibition of a MAP3K member, MLK3, increases CD8 T cell cytotoxicity via inhibition of a prolyl isomerase, Ppia, and nuclear translocation of NFATc1. The MLK3 inhibitor increased the tumor infiltration of cytotoxic T cells in an immune-competent mouse model of breast cancer. Similarly, the MLK3 inhibitor increased the cytotoxic T cell population in pan T cells isolated from breast cancer patients with metastatic disease. These results suggest that small-molecule inhibitor of MLK3 might have clinical usage even in the advanced stage of the disease, where tumor-induced immunosuppression is frequent.","815":"Mobile Pixel-Pushing With the Wacom One | Fstoppers When working in Photoshop from home or on the road, the new Wacom One tablet can be a super helpful tool that matches up especially well with your laptop, giving you not only the control you get with a stylus and tablet but an additional screen as well.\n\nAs a digital artist, I love the retouching and compositing projects I get to work on for my clients. And from day one, using a Wacom tablet has been essential to this work. For nearly 30 years, I've used Photoshop to paint, clone, mask, composite, etc. and cannot imagine how I could even think of working without a good stylus andtablet. (Unless you like the idea of painting with a brick, 'er mouse.)\n\nBut for all the ease working with my Wacom Intuos has brought to the work, I have always jealously watched those of my colleagues who had a Wacom Cintiq, wondering how it would be to be able to paint directly on the screen. But the cost of those large Cintiq devices was always a barrier for me.\n\nThen, Wacom came out with the Wacom One, sort of a Cintiq lite, priced in that \"gotta have it\" range that pulled me in.\n\nAt about 13 inches, the Wacom One is a bit smaller than the Cintiq 16, the smallest Cintiq, but it's light and compact enough to fit into my workspace easily. And for those of you who are working from home or need a mobile setup, the Wacom One matches up perfectly with your laptop!\n\nIn fact, I think pairing your Wacom One with your laptop might be the best way to go for anyone working on the road or from home. The screen calibrates well, giving you a pretty accurate view of your image while also letting you extend the viewing space available much the same way you might add an extra monitor to your larger workstation. Add in the fact that you can use the stylus it comes with to retouch and paint directly on the screen, and you have a winning combination.\n\nAnd it is indeed the ability to work directly on the screen that makes this tablet so useful, even if you already have a dual monitor setup on your home or office workstation. For instance, one of the most difficult tasks I have to do when compositing shots of people for movie posters and the like is painting hair, especially for women with long hair! No matter how clean a mask you're able to create for the hair, it seems it's almost always necessary to paint in those stray or flowing hairs to get a really natural-looking composite.\n\nIn the image below, shot by Nicole York, she needed the model masked out so she could composite him into another background.\n\n\u00a9 Nicole York\n\nAs happens so often, it turns out you can only get so far with masking hair like this using various tricks like channel pulls or Select and Mask, etc. In the end, you have to paint in a lot of hair to wind up with something that works really well. In the image below, you can see the version on the left has an okay mask for the hair, but it still looks really rough, while the one on the right with more hair hand-painted looks a lot more natural.\n\nAfter using Photoshop's Select and Mask to refine the mask around the hair, the image on the left still looked rough. The one on the right had additional hairs painted in using the Wacom One.\n\nAnd it's in these kinds of jobs where being able to paint directly on the screen comes in handy. The hand-eye coordination is just that much easier, making painting those longer hairs a much more intuitive task.\n\nAnother task where it's really helpful to be able to work directly on the screen is dodging and burning when working on getting a high-end result for portraits and beauty images. The precision that working directly on what you're looking at makes it so much easier to get the results you're after, because it feels so much more natural.\n\nFor instance, in the shot below, from photographer Emily Teague, the model was wearing a veil that had some wrinkles on it that added distracting light and dark streaks.\n\nThe veil created light and dark streaks on her face that needed careful dodging and burning to smooth out. \u00a9 Emily Teague\n\nCleaning those up took careful brushwork in applying the dodging and burning. Again, being able to paint directly on the screen made that work much easier. So much easier, in fact, I found myself going much deeper into the details than I normally would.\n\nThe Wacom One allows for painting directly on the screen, making it far easier to accurately paint in the dodge and burn layers as needed.\n\nHere you can see the final result after the distracting dark and light streaks from the veil were cleaned up.\n\nThe Wacom One really hits the sweet spot between usefulness and affordability, especially if you're looking to enhance your mobile retouching. The $400 price certainly makes this an option worth considering.\n\nImages used with permission from Nicole York and Emily Teague. \u00ad\u00ad","816":"Model-based integration of genomics and metabolomics reveals SNP functionality in Mycobacterium tuberculosis This article requires a subscription to view the full text. If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nBecause genetic diversity in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) is less pronounced than in other pathogens, the variable outcome of infection has been attributed mainly to host and environmental factors. Here, we reveal widely different metabolic phenotypes among MTBC members, suggesting that strain diversity may play an important role during infection. To unravel the genetic basis for metabolic diversity, we developed a approach that integrates metabolomic and genomic data for 18 MTBC clinical strains. Our approach allowed us to investigate the metabolic effect of rare genetic variants and to predict mutations that associate with strain-specific metabolic vulnerabilities and inherent baseline susceptibility to antibiotics. Our model-based approach is broadly applicable to many organisms, opening possibilities for identifying more selective treatment strategies.","817":"Modified nucleotides may have enhanced early RNA catalysis Edited by Jack W. Szostak, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, and approved February 28, 2020 (received for review June 8, 2018)\n\nThe modern version of the RNA World Hypothesis begins with activated ribonucleotides condensing (nonenzymatically) to make RNA molecules, some of which possess (perhaps slight) catalytic activity. We propose that noncanonical ribonucleotides, which would have been inevitable under prebiotic conditions, might decrease the RNA length required to have useful catalytic function by allowing short RNAs to possess a more versatile collection of folded motifs. We argue that modified versions of the standard bases, some with features that resemble cofactors, could have facilitated that first moment in which early RNA molecules with catalytic capability began their evolutionary path toward self-replication.","818":"Modulation of androgen receptor DNA binding activity through direct interaction with the ETS transcription factor ERG Contributed by Charles L.

In addition to providing a biochemical system to evaluate AR activity on different DNA templates, our findings provide insight into why ERG-positive prostate cancers have an expanded AR cistrome.","819":"Mohun Bagan Clinch I-League Title With 1-0 Win Over Aizawl FC  | Football News Indian football heavyweights Mohun Bagan clinched their second I-League title with a 1-0 win over Aizawl FC with four rounds to go in the season in Kalyani West Bengal, on Tuesday. Prolific Senegalese striker Baba Diawara scored the all-important goal for Mohun Bagan in the 80th minute to beat former champions Aizawl in their 16th round match and give their supporters a memorable Holi gift. It was former Sevilla striker's 10th goal from nine consecutive games. With Tuesday's win at the Kalyani Municipality Stadium, Mohun Bagan have 39 points from 16 matches. They are 16 points ahead of second-placed East Bengal (23 points from 16 matches) who cannot catch up their arch city rivals even if they win all their four remaining matches.\n\nMohun Bagan, who won their first I-League title in 2014-15 season, also matched Dempo's record of wrapping up I-League title with maximum matches left to play.\n\nDempo SC of Goa had also sealed the I-League title in 2009-10 season with four matches left to play.\n\nThe title in their pocket, Mohun Bagan will also enter their second leg Kolkata Derby match against arch rivals East Bengal on Sunday with a psychological advantage. They had beaten East Bengal 2-1 in the first leg on January 19.\n\nAizawl were not, however, intimidated either by the occasion or the 17,000 partisan home crowd which had packed the stands as they dished out a thoroughly professional performance in the first half.\n\nJoe Zoeherliana and Rochharzela were a constant threat on the right and Paul Ramfangzuawa was also getting himself into a lot of space in the middle of the park.\n\nRochharzela, in fact, had the first crack at goal in the 12th minute and goalkeeper Sankar had to go full stretch to bring about his first save of the game.\n\nHe had a second crack in the 34th minute, this time from a closer range, but was wide of the target.\n\nThe visitors' defence was also much more organised and Ghanaian Joseph Adjei's marking of Diawara was paying initial dividends.\n\nMohun Bagan, on the other hand, had more possession in the first quarter of the hour but were finding it difficult to get a clear sight at goal.\n\nDiawara almost dribbled through once from a Tursunov-Naorem move and Suhair had the first shot on target from a distance for the home side at the half-hour mark.\n\nThe deadlock remained at the end of the first 45 minutes and to Aizawl's credit, they did not put a step back even in the second half.\n\nJaryan hit a free-kick early but it went straight to Sankar and that was probably the last strong approach Aizawl had in the game.\n\nMohun Bagan began to step up with around 20 minutes left on the clock.\n\nNaorem found Diawara with a fine ball inside the goalkeeper's area but Zothanmawia did well to snatch it from his head and Ashutosh Mehta had a go at the Aizawl goal but missed the target.\n\nBeitia then initiated a move that involved successively Naorem, Tursunov and finally Mehta, but the resulting cross which met with a Diawara header went off target.\n\nThe title-winning goal finally came in the 80th minute to send the Kalyani Stadium into a frenzy.\n\nIt was Beitia again who began the move and after reaching near the box, squared the ball to Diawara.\n\nKasagga could have done better to stop the ball from reaching Diawara but once it was with the Senagalese striker and with space in front of him, it was always going to be dangerous.\n\nDiawara once again came up with a clinical finish under pressure as he unleashed a fierce grounder which beat the Aizawl keeper all along to hit the net.\n\nAs Mohun Bagan saw off the final minutes, the stands erupted in colourful celebrations with emotions running high.","820":"Moldy shower caulk... fixed! Dirty bathrooms are a huge turnoff for home buyers. Mold is another huge turnoff. Combine the two and the 'yuck' factor multiplies. I think everyone has seen moldy bathroom caulk before, and if you've tried cleaning this stuff, you know it's impossible.\n\nI was reminded of this topic while blogging about the top 5 places to find mold in your home last week, so I'm doing a re-blog on this topic, along with a video.\n\nBack in 2011, I moved into a somewhat distressed property that needed some TLC. Among the list of neglected items was some nasty-looking caulk in the master bathroom shower. Yep, that's my shower pictured above. I figured I would need to remove all of the moldy caulking and re-caulk my shower walls to get them looking good again, but after doing some online research, I found a cleaning method that worked surprisingly well and wasn't much work. I was so happy with the results that I had to share the process.\n\nGather supplies. You'll need a small mixing bowl, bleach, baking soda, a brush, a roll of plastic wrap, a spray bottle, and a respirator. The plastic wrap (green handle, clear plastic) shown in the photo below is the stuff you use to wrap things together, but you can also use the same plastic wrap you keep in your kitchen. Also known as Saran Wrap. Also, wear old clothes that you wouldn't mind spilling bleach on. It will happen.\n\nMix up your cleaning solution. The cleaning solution consists of a bleach and baking soda paste. You make it by mixing bleach and baking soda in a bowl until it's about the consistency of pancake batter. The baking soda doesn't do any cleaning; it's just a cheap powder that will help make the bleach pasty. Don't skimp on the cleaning solution here; go ahead and make way more than you think you'll need. Bleach and baking soda are both inexpensive. Be sure to wear your respirator while doing this.\n\nApply the cleaning solution to the moldy caulk. Use your brush to apply the bleach paste onto the moldy caulk. Again, don't skimp here; it's cheap, so cake it on. If you happen to use a disposable paintbrush, I suggest working quickly. The bleach might disintegrate the bristles on your brush.\n\nCover the cleaning solution with plastic and wait. Covering the cleaning solution with plastic will help to keep the bleach from drying out. Now you wait. If you have a white porcelain kitchen sink or white porcelain whatever-else, spread the extra cleaning paste on it. You can just let the paste sit for about 10 minutes, and then your sink will look brand new when you rinse the bleach off. No scrubbing required.\n\nCheck on it. After the bleach has been sitting for an hour, it will probably have dried out, despite the plastic covering. At this point, if the caulking looks as good as new, great! You're done. If you still have moldy caulk, put some bleach in a spray bottle and wet the walls down right above the plastic wrap. The bleach will run down underneath the plastic and re-saturate the paste. You can do this as many times as it takes, but even with my super-nasty caulk, I only needed to re-apply the bleach one time.\n\nNow clean up. At this point, your caulk should look brand new and bleachy fresh, or at least pretty close to it. Now you can clean up the mess with water. Click on the before and after photos below for a larger version to see how well this worked. If I were a better photographer, all of the whites would have looked the same, but oh well... I think you get the point.\n\nI was amazed by how well this worked. The entire project probably involved about 20 minutes of work and required no elbow grease whatsoever.\n\nAnd now, a word of caution: do this project at your own risk. Bleach is powerful stuff. Read the warning label on the bleach. It says to use in a well-ventilated area, don't let it touch your skin, don't breathe the vapors, etc. Bleach can also cause pits in metal. I used it on the metal trim ring for my shower faucet and no pitting occurred, but other people might not be so lucky. Also, I'm not kidding about wearing a respirator.","821":"Momentum-resolved superconducting energy gaps of Sr2RuO4 from quasiparticle interference imaging This article requires a subscription to view the full text. If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nSrRuO has been widely studied as a candidate correlated topological superconductor. However, the momentum space structure of the superconducting energy gaps, which encode both the pairing mechanism and its topological nature, has proven impossible to determine by conventional techniques. To address this challenge, we introduce Bogoliubov quasiparticle scattering interference visualization at millikelvin temperatures. We discover that the \u03b1 and \u03b2 bands of SrRuO support thermodynamically prevalent superconducting energy gaps and that they each contain four gap nodes (or profound minima) that are contiguous to the lines in momentum space. In the context of other recent advances, these observations appear most consistent with a order parameter symmetry for SrRuO.","822":"Monkeygate Was Lowest Point As Australia Captain, Says Ricky Ponting | Cricket News Australia's two-time World Cup-winning former skipper Ricky Ponting considers the 2008 'Monkeygate' scandal the lowest point of his captaincy stint as he feels he was not in control of what was happened at that time. The scandal unfolded when senior Indian off-spinner Harbhajan Singh was charged with racially abusing Australian all-rounder Andrew Symonds during the second Test at Sydney. \"Monkeygate was probably the lowest (point in career as captain). Losing the 2005 Ashes series was tough but I was in full control of that.

I remember coming off the ground during the Adelaide Test match and speaking to Cricket Australia officials about the case because the hearing was at the end of the Adelaide Test match,\" Ponting added.\n\nThe incident created a lot of bitterness between the two teams with India threatening to pull out of the tour before the ICC intervened.\n\n\"We all felt let down by the end result (of the the Monkeygate controversy).

And certainly better loved. That's largely thanks to the man inside the costume. Caroll Spinney has been teaching and delighting generations of kids since our tall, yellow feathered friend debuted in 1969. Co-directors Dave LaMattina and Chad N. Walker's affectionate salute to the fellow who hatched the bird is a touching, overdue round of applause.\n\nWhile Big Bird radiates gentle tenderness, Spinney had a harsh childhood. A puppeteer and cartoonist from his early years, he faced a critical, sometimes violent father and bullying schoolmates. He was discovered by Jim Henson after flubbing a presentation at an industry gathering. Joining Henson's TV team was like oxygen for the sad-natured Spinney. He transformed the ill-defined bird into a sweet, inquisitive optimist who became the star of the show.\n\nThe film is honest about the difficulties complicating Spinney's life. The end of his first marriage triggered such painful anxiety that he considered jumping from their ninth-floor New York apartment. Now 81, he has a new long-term love and, though playing the character is physically demanding, he's considering another five years. \"He's an artist,\" one friend says, \"and not many artists retire.\"\n\nAs the film begins, Mitch Lowe (Sean Astin, not much seen since the \"Lord of the Rings\" era) moves through his lower-class home preparing to cruise Lake Michigan, without the cheery look of a guy planning a sunny afternoon out. It's not until he's far from his Milwaukee home base that we begin to understand why he looked at a cemetery en route.\n\nHis getaway is disrupted when he sees a crashed small plane with injured pilot Kerry (Chris Mulkey) clinging to a floating wing and a mysterious bag. Soon the strangers are in Mitch's shabby boat, lost, with no means of communication, facing problems like what sank Robert Redford in \"All Is Lost.\"\n\nThis is the sort of film where you enjoy the cast even though the running time becomes a bit of a snore. Mulkey (\"Whiplash,\" \"Captain Phillips\") creates a fine multiple-personality style for his character, who is knowledgeable, fierce and a complete grouch. \"My mother told me, 'If you had another brain it'd be lonely,'\u2009\" he growls. \"Meeting you I know what she meant.\"\n\nAstin balances his underdog's helpful intentions, limited resources and self-destructive depression. Their acting far outperforms the film's story\u00adtelling abilities. Directed by Gil Cates Jr. and written by Jeff Gendelman, the dialogue resembles the wordy conversation you hear in theater. You can sense trouble brewing when the film begins with the unforgivable clich\u00e9 of a bedroom alarm clock.

No! So, why should you do it with digital files?\n\nAdobe Lightroom offers many tools to organize your data and find the image you are looking for. Here is how I organize my photographs.\n\nGetting Along With Data\n\nIf I printed all of my photographs in 300 dpi, I could completely pave the streets of my hometown with them. But where is the image of my friend's sister's wedding? Was it 2018 or 2019? With the right map, I don't need to go all the way until I find the image by accident. By using a few tools in Lightroom, you can also guide yourself through images of family events, shoots for clients, and travel photographs that you might give a purpose one day.\n\nBy investing a little work in advance, you prevent a stressful mess in the future. It's best to apply a system when you're paving your drive with fresh photographs. But you can still organize your old images whenever you find the time. What about now? Scrolling through old gems can also be a fun activity that everyone can do from home. It will also have a long-lasting effect on your time management whenever life is running faster again.\n\nHere's your solution: It took me seconds to find this photograph of the \"guide\" from years ago, because I kept my work organized.\n\nThe Basics for Organizing Your Photographs\n\nBefore we take a look at possible methods about managing pictures, we should talk about the basics first:\n\nConsistency\n\nWhen you're dealing with Lightroom and develop a workflow for managing your photographs, it's important to stay consistent. You don't want to mix several strategies and create a mess. If you labeled images of weddings in orange in 2015, used tags in 2016, and introduced your own collection in 2017, you might have trouble finding the photo of the couple that you wanted to include in your new portfolio.\n\nBackups\n\nEven if you don't print your images, you can still use them. Drives love to break at the moment when you need them the most (which is always). You should never forget to back your files up and have at least a second version of every image. Some people prefer steady drives for their office. They often offer a safe solution for a lot of data. I am constantly on the move and prefer a set of some smaller external drives.\n\nIndividual Needs\n\nEven though I don't claim to have a cure-all workflow, I experimented a lot to be happy with my Lightroom strategy. It suits me because I shoot a lot of images for different purposes, and sometimes these purposes get mixed up. My travel images can become editorials, some photographs are shot for clients and used in my blog as well. Others were only a photographic experiment but became a portfolio shot. You might need your solutions but can find some inspiration here. If you keep your system as open as possible, it's also easier to integrate new projects later.\n\nLightroom\n\nLightroom is only software. With alternatives like Capture One becoming more and more popular, you might want to switch your developing technique one day. Maybe you won't even need a computer anymore, because you tell your camera: \"Show me the photograph that I'm looking for,\" and you'll get the picture of your sister's friend's wedding. Until then, you need to work the best you can with what you have. The current software performs well here. Lightroom, for example, is nondestructive and leaves your digital negatives the way they are. Switching systems without loss of data may cause some work but won't be impossible.\n\nTools to Organize Your Photographs in Lightroom\n\nSeveral tools in Lightroom allow you to apply different systems of categorization. Here is how I use a few of them.\n\nCatalog Structure\n\nI prefer to have all the images in one catalog. Why? Because I don't want to open a new catalog whenever I search for an image. While I know photographers who store every session or project in a new catalog, I feel I'd throw away half of my capabilities. I understand it in the case of work that's done explicitly for a client, but I prefer to eventually have all photos in one place.\n\nYet, there is an exception. As my memory is good enough to make me remember what I have done during the last year, I use a separate catalog for the current year, which I will integrate into the big catalog every winter. This way, I keep my current work together and quickly get an overview, which allows me to work faster on ongoing projects. After all, the best system doesn't save me from the growing number of photographs in the big joint catalog.\n\nKeywords\n\nWhile I'm importing images from my SD card, I start tagging them with keywords. They help me find images for my blog or other articles (like Fstoppers), where I frequently need to visualize whatever I wrote. Keywords should be structured, too. I usually select them from following areas (mostly 3-5 tags for each session):\n\nthe name of the location (country, city, sight) the style of photography (product, landscape, portrait) light condition (harsh, sunrise, night) feelings (happy, sad, warm) purpose (blog, newspaper, education) subject (tree, face, bird)\n\nTagging pictures with keywords is one of the best ways to find representative images for certain categories of images. For searching for a whole session, there is even an easier method.\n\nYou'll find the option of adding metadata in the dialog for importing your photos in Lightroom.\n\nOrganizing Into Collections\n\nCollections are the photo albums within your catalog. You can build them up like a folder structure on your drive, where you go from general to specific. Collection Sets allow you to consolidate different collections. Every session that I shot will be put into a single collection, which is subordinated to one of four different collection sets:\n\nClients: Here is everything that I shot on assignment. Whenever I got hired, I'll put the pictures here. It's what I'm paid for. Stories: I often use photographs to visualize a written article or what I think might become a story one day. Or I create a story only through images. The potential moneymakers end up here. Personal: Snapshots from my mobile phone, photographs of birthday parties, pictures from vacations: they will all end up here and stay ready for anniversaries, blackmailing of friends who want to occupy an important office, or to annoy my future grandchildren. Personal images sometimes become editorials, especially when I travel. I'd leave them here if it happened unplanned. Practice: Every time I go out to learn something new or shoot for practice and leisure (a lot of landscape images in here) are included in this collection set. Many of them make it to blog posts and Fstoppers articles, some of them become stock photographs, and a few remind me of the possibility of failure.\n\nTo stay organized, I also add the year to my collections, like \"2018 - India\", or \"2017 - the wedding of XY\". This way, I won't get lost in the joint catalog's collections.\n\nA reasonable overview of the four main-categories of my photographs.\n\nRatings\n\nRatings are important for bigger editorial projects, practices, and client work alike. They're not too important for personal pictures, though, but can be quite handy, too. This is why I try to rate all of my images, even though it's time-consuming and my taste often changes. Since I'm working for Fstoppers and also love to watch Lee's and Patrick's Critique the Community videos, I tend to apply the same rating to my images (even though I'm not too hard on my images, because after all, I need a portfolio). That means:\n\nOne star: Snapshot, disappointing myself. I'll only keep a one-star image if it was the only photograph of a special moment. Two stars: Needs improvement. I'll keep these images only if I think I might laugh about them one day or if they have some emotional value to me. Three stars: A solid image, which can easily be published along with written articles. Some end up on my Instagram. Four stars: Portfolio image. I will most likely show these to others or include them in my portfolio. Five stars: My own \"World Class.\" Even though I probably didn't shoot an image that would be rated \"World Class\" in Critique the Community, five-star images are whatever I feel are the best I can produce. I'm ready to send these images to contests and put them into my portfolio. At the moment, I've got four 5-star images -- about 0.0002% of my total portfolio.\n\nAs skills, taste, and experience grow with time, I often reduce the number of stars or sometimes rate a photograph up -- whenever I come across an unfair rating. Ratings help me to quickly filter for great images whenever quality counts. It's vital for reportage and weddings.\n\nColor Label\n\nColor labels are used in different ways. Because I often have to deal with image rights and use pictures multiple times, I use colors to define the use of an image. Especially for documentary work, I might give away an exclusive license, so I must not publish the image somewhere else. For this reason, my labeling serves as a check system.\n\nRed: Exclusive rights granted. These images won't be exported again but serve as a backup. Work for clients also falls under this category. I might ask to pick a portfolio image from these. Yellow: Licensed (not exclusively). I sold these images once and can do so again. I prefer to find others, though. Green: Open for use. Photographs with potential. Blue: Private use of blogs and articles. Multiple use is no problem.\n\nPrivate photographs simply won't get a color label, unless I want to publish them.\n\nVery handy: You can rename your color labels in the library under \"Metadata\" -> \"Color Label Set\" -> \"Edit...\"\n\nMany Options\n\nComplicated situations need advanced systems. How do you organize your photographs? Do you use Lightroom? Do you include other tools as well? If you found a great system for yourself, feel free to share it in the comments.","831":"Myosin filament-based regulation of the dynamics of contraction in heart muscle Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of death worldwide, and is frequently associated with heart failure. Efforts to develop better therapeutics for heart failure have been held back by limited understanding of the normal control of contraction on the timescale of the heartbeat. We used synchrotron X-ray diffraction to determine the dynamic structural changes in the myosin motors that drive contraction in the heart muscle, and show that myosin filament-based control mechanisms determine the time course and strength of contraction, allowing those mechanisms to be targeted for developing new therapies for heart disease.\n\nMyosin-based mechanisms are increasingly recognized as supplementing their better-known actin-based counterparts to control the strength and time course of contraction in both skeletal and heart muscle. Here we use synchrotron small-angle X-ray diffraction to determine the structural dynamics of local domains of the myosin filament during contraction of heart muscle. We show that, although myosin motors throughout the filament contribute to force development, only about 10% of the motors in each filament bear the peak force, and these are confined to the filament domain containing myosin binding protein-C, the \"C-zone.\" Myosin motors in domains further from the filament midpoint are likely to be activated and inactivated first in each contraction. Inactivated myosin motors are folded against the filament core, and a subset of folded motors lie on the helical tracks described previously. These helically ordered motors are also likely to be confined to the C-zone, and the associated motor conformation reforms only slowly during relaxation. Myosin filament stress-sensing determines the strength and time course of contraction in conjunction with actin-based regulation. These results establish the fundamental roles of myosin filament domains and the associated motor conformations in controlling the strength and dynamics of contraction in heart muscle, enabling those structures to be targeted to develop new therapies for heart disease.","832":"N.K. Jemisin Confronts the City We're Becoming CityLab talked to Jemisin about the complexities of mapping each borough onto individual characters' personalities, what her childhood years in New York were like, and the ways in which New York is under attack by forces already coursing through the city. The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nWhat are some of the biggest changes you've noticed in New York over the course of your lifetime?\n\nI've engaged with different parts of New York in my life. I've lived in Williamsburg, Crown Heights and most recently Bed-Stuy. As a child, it was mostly Williamsburg, which was not what it's like now. These days, it's gentrification central, hipster central. There's even been problems within the last few years of bars hosting white supremacist bands, that kind of thing, which was not the Williamsburg I grew up with. As a kid, it was mostly poor Latinos, artists, and Hasidic Jewish people. You got to understand the rhythms of all of those groups, and while not everyone was part of every group, they cohabitated and were able to interrelate. They had problems, they had stress with each other, but on the other hand, they also mostly got along.\n\nAnd now, that kind of tripartite complexity to that neighborhood is kind of being swept away by people who hate all of us. Williamsburg would not be Williamsburg without a Hasidic and Puerto Rican and artistic presence. But the new folks coming in not only are effectively making it impossible for those groups to still live there, but they're also like, \"Get out and stay out, we don't like you.\" Cities and neighborhoods have always changed; that is a normal part of city life. But the extra measure of, \"We're going to make it impossible for pretty much anybody except for who looks like us to be here and still we hate you, and we're going to show contempt for what made this city what it is,\" that part is new. And that's the part that I guess I'm engaging with or wrestling against.\n\nIn the book, as the embodiment of New York City struggles to come to life and needs the other boroughs to help sustain it, you write, \"New York is too much for one person to embody.\" What was it like to give definition to each of the individual boroughs, and shape their personalities as representations of millions of people?\n\nWhat I wanted to do was deliberately engage with some of the stereotypes of the boroughs, that I, as an on-again off-again New Yorker, had seen and also seen defied over the course of my life, things we also see in the media and so forth. I deliberately created stereotypical representations of each borough, and then I tried to sort of complicate those. I know that I succeeded to varying degrees. I was not able to devote enough time, without making the book unnecessarily longer, to a couple of the avatars that I really wanted to.\n\nQueens, for example, we didn't get to see enough complication with her, in my opinion. But I wanted to start with a stereotype: Queens is the neighborhood of immigrants, it's the neighborhood of the middle class in New York these days. We have always been the city that is in many ways the gateway of immigration in the United States, so there had to be at least one there. And I wanted to try and kind of engage with that. But she's also a person, she's got an attitude. She's adapted to New York enough that her first reflex in moments of stress is to try to hit somebody.\n\nThis is what I wanted to do: Let's start with the stereotype and then mess with it. Take Brooklyn, for example. I have lived all my life among women like Brooklyn, because that is what I see walking down the street in Bed-Stuy: working-class women who either made good because their families were able to get a foothold here, or who were struggling because that foothold is being pulled out from under them. Her character is someone who can speak to both -- who can speak to middle-class life and to struggle life, you know? This is what I'm trying to encapsulate.","833":"NAF trains 31 in helicopter attacks The Nigerian Air Force has trained and graduated a batch of 31 personnel in helicopter attacks.

Built from the experience and lessons learned from NCO professionals across history, to create the NCO Professional of today is the backbone of the Army.The NCOLCoE believes the knowledge garnered from NCO history is vital and created an NCO History website, through the Office of the Historian.The website is created to receive written or recorded contributions from all service members, past and present, to tell their NCO story.\"History is dynamic, whether we believe it or not,\" Dr. Everett Dague, Command Historian, NCOLCoE expressed. \"History is the study of the past, but it is also the backbone of all academic and intellectual activities.\"Dague added, \"history is ultimately about who we are and what our identity is.\"The website helps create the linkage to see the NCO as a professional.\"The idea that NCOs are professionals, or that being an NCO is a profession by itself, is a comparatively new one,\" he said. \"A professional NCO is educated to lead and to act as an asset in understanding, communicating, and executing mission objectives and the commander's intent.\"Future NCOs will learn valuable lessons obtained from experience that goes beyond the Military Occupation Specialty, through this website.Dague explains the three objectives of the NCO Corps History website.\"First, it provides a platform for NCOs to record their experiences, challenges, and solutions as NCOs, rather than as a member of a unit or as a MOS,\" he said.Soldiers get to see their career path beyond their technical MOS proficiency.\"Second, it provides a place for NCOs and other Soldiers to see how the NCO Corps career path advances, which creates a better universal understanding of what the NCO profession is all about throughout the entire Army.\"The website is a resource to not only help the NCOs of the future but to tell the NCO story continuously.\"Lastly, it provides an archival record for researchers looking to develop scholarship on the NCO profession a collection of primary sources and material, which in turn supports the understanding of the NCOs identity, role, function, and profession,\" he said.Dr. Dague speaks to the changes in the NCO educational system, and the evolution of the NCO Corps.\"I am currently working on a project comparing the NCO Corps of the Korean War, Vietnam, and the first Gulf War,\" he said. \"There are several profound differences between all three, but the major one - and the one I am most interested in looking at - is education and the concept of the NCO as a professional.\"Dague said the Gulf War NCO is the product of decades of the NCOES and rethinking what an NCO was and what they did.\"The result,\" he said, \"the Gulf War NCO was much better prepared and a much stronger asset on the battlefield, which affected overall Army performance on and off the battlefield.\"The website creates a path for NCOs to know where they came from and the nature of their profession.\"Providing professionals - any professional,\" he said. \"NCO, officer or otherwise - with a critical, systematic, academically sound examination of their past lays the foundation for understanding who these professionals are.\"The NCOLCoE presents the experiences of the past to help create holistically fit, disciplined, well-educated professionals capable of meeting the challenges of large-scale combat operations in a multi-domain environment.Dague added, \"the mission of the historian in the age of the NCOLCoE is to show the NCO as less Sgt. Rock and more Command Sgt. Major Sellers [the NCOLCoE commandant] and how they got that way.\"Soldiers who submit their experience to the website will have their entry scanned for operational security, and upon approval, posted to the site.\"One thing we do is maintain a record of what and how the information is submitted,\" Dague said. \"For example, we can accept videos, and it does not have to be a written submission. We also look for trends in thought and issues, which could suggest future research venues.\"Dague explains, \"ideally, the contributor has a best practices story, a unique take on the NCO experience, or an account of something that prompted a better understanding of themselves as an NCO professional.\"If you have an experience you think will contribute to the identity, mission, or professional development of your peers, or if you want to give back to the NCO Corps, visit https:\/\/ncolcoe.armylive.dodlive.mil\/submit-your-story or email usarmy.bliss.usasma.mbx.usasma-nco-history@mail.mil, and become a part of NCO history.","837":"NETosis proceeds by cytoskeleton and endomembrane disassembly and PAD4-mediated chromatin decondensation and nuclear envelope rupture Neutrophils are white blood cells specialized as the first line of host defense in the immune system. One way they protect organisms is through NETosis, in which they expel their DNA to form a web-like trap that ensnares pathogens and promotes clotting. However, NETs also mediate sterile inflammation, causing damage to the body. We used high-resolution live-cell microscopy to characterize the timing of dynamic cellular events leading to NETosis in human and mouse neutrophils and a neutrophil-like cell line. We discovered that NETosis proceeds by a stepwise sequence of cellular events that is conserved across species and requires the activity of the PAD4 enzyme for DNA to be released from the nucleus and cell membrane.\n\nNeutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are web-like DNA structures decorated with histones and cytotoxic proteins that are released by activated neutrophils to trap and neutralize pathogens during the innate immune response, but also form in and exacerbate sterile inflammation. Peptidylarginine deiminase 4 (PAD4) citrullinates histones and is required for NET formation (NETosis) in mouse neutrophils. While the in vivo impact of NETs is accumulating, the cellular events driving NETosis and the role of PAD4 in these events are unclear. We performed high-resolution time-lapse microscopy of mouse and human neutrophils and differentiated HL-60 neutrophil-like cells (dHL-60) labeled with fluorescent markers of organelles and stimulated with bacterial toxins or Candida albicans to induce NETosis. Upon stimulation, cells exhibited rapid disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton, followed by shedding of plasma membrane microvesicles, disassembly and remodeling of the microtubule and vimentin cytoskeletons, ER vesiculation, chromatin decondensation and nuclear rounding, progressive plasma membrane and nuclear envelope (NE) permeabilization, nuclear lamin meshwork and then NE rupture to release DNA into the cytoplasm, and finally plasma membrane rupture and discharge of extracellular DNA. Inhibition of actin disassembly blocked NET release. Mouse and dHL-60 cells bearing genetic alteration of PAD4 showed that chromatin decondensation, lamin meshwork and NE rupture and extracellular DNA release required the enzymatic and nuclear localization activities of PAD4. Thus, NETosis proceeds by a stepwise sequence of cellular events culminating in the PAD4-mediated expulsion of DNA.","838":"NHL Power Rankings: The most impressive single season stats By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy\n\nIn this week's edition of the NHL Power Rankings we take a look back at some of the impressive single season statistics in league history.\n\nFrom 50 goals in 50 games, to an unbelievable Mario Lemieux performance, to some statistical oddities featuring some of the game's all-time greats. We limited it to one entry per player and separated them into three tiers: The truly great all-time performances, performances that stood out within the context of their era, and then finally some random fun ones at the end.\n\nWhich performances made the cut this week?\n\nTo the rankings!\n\nAll-time great individual performances\n\n1. Bobby Orr's 139 points. Before Orr came along defensemen were simply not a major part of the offensive scene in the NHL. At least not as it related to appearing on the score sheet. Orr completely changed that, as well the perception of what a defenseman could be and the role they could play. He was the first defenseman to ever top the 100-point mark and lead the league in scoring when he finished with 120 points during the 1969-70 season. His performance the next season was even better when he hit the 139-point mark, a number that will probably never be reached by another defender. During Orr's peak in Boston the only player in the NHL that could compare to him offensively was his teammate, Phil Esposito.\n\n2. Mario Lemieux's 160 points in 60 games. The 1992-93 season is the single most dominant season of Lemieux's career, even if the final stat line does not show the most goals or points. First, that per-game average would have projected out to be 218 points over 82 games, a number that would have been an NHL record. It also came during a season in which he overcame Hodgkins disease and returned to the ice in Philadelphia on the day of his final radiation treatment. He received a standing ovation from the Flyers crowd when he took the ice. Later that season he received another standing ovation from another notoriously brutal crowd when he scored five goals in Madison Square Garden against the New York Rangers. Imagine how dominant you have to be to get standing ovations as a visiting player in Philadelphia and New York. In the same season.\n\nWhen he returned to the lineup on March 2 following his treatment, he trailed Pat Lafontaine by 12 points in the NHL scoring race. He ended up winning the scoring race by 12 points. That was a 24-point swing in a little more than a month.\n\n3. Wayne Gretzky's 92 goals. Gretzky could have several entries on a list like this, but we will stick with his 1981-82 season where he scored an NHL record 92 goals, including 50 in his first 39 games. That is the fastest any player has ever reached the 50 goal mark. Entering Game 38 of that season he was sitting on 41 goals before scoring four goals to give him 45 on the season. In his very next game he scored five goals to hit the 50-mark.\n\n4. Maurice Richard's 50 goals in 50 games. Richard became the first player in NHL history to score 50 goals in a single season when he accomplished the feat during the 1944-45 season, scoring his 50th goal in the 50th (and final) game of the season. Before this no player in NHL history had ever scored more than 44 goals in a season (Joe Malone score 44 in 20 games during the 1917-18 season), while the 40-goal mark had been topped just four times.\n\n5. Tony Esposito's 15 shutouts. The 15-shutout mark has been reached five times in NHL history. The first instances all came between the 1925 and 1929 seasons when the NHL was still in its infancy and goals were rare. The other came during the 1969-70 season when Esposito reached the mark as a rookie. He did it in only 63 games and won the NHL's rookie of the year award, the Vezina Trophy, and was second in Hart Trophy voting.\n\nStory continues\n\n6. Teemu Selanne's 76 rookie goals. This is a record that still stands and it is difficult to imagine it falling anytime soon. Selanne burst onto the scene with the Jets during the 1992-93 season and finished tied with Alexander Mogilny for the goal-scoring crown by filling the back of the net 76 times. When he broke Mike Bossy's rookie record he delivered one of the greatest celebrations of all time.\n\n7. Dominik Hasek's 13 shutouts. Arguably the single most dominant goalie in NHL history. Hasek's run between 1993 and 1999 was a clinic in goaltending excellence. You knew every year he was going to lead the league in pretty much every goaltending category and take home the Vezina Trophy. The one number that stands out from that run was his 13 shutouts during the 1997-98 season. It is one of just three seasons in NHL history after 1930 where a goalie recorded more than 12 shutouts in a season -- Esposito's aforementioned 15 shutouts, and Harry Lumsley with 13 during the 1954-55 season.\n\nUnheard of for the era performances\n\n8. Alex Ovechkin's 65 goals. The best goal-scoring of all time was at his best during the 2007-08 season when he scored 65 goals. It is not the most impressive single goal scoring season in NHL history, but when the era and goal-scoring climate at the time is taken into account is incredible. Only two other players in the league scored more than 47 goals that season, and the league was entering a stretch where Ovechkin was the only player capable of hitting the 50-goal mark.\n\n9. Nikita Kucherov's 128 points. It had been 25 years since a player reached a point total like this. Between the 2012 and 2018 seasons the 100-point scorer had become nearly extinct in the NHL with only a few exceptions. The idea of someone scoring 128 points in 2019 just seemed unheard of.\n\n10. Mike Green's 31 goals. Again, not the highest total ever for a defenseman, but Green's 31 goals came during an incredibly low-scoring era in the history of the league, and he hit that mark in only 68 games! That is a 38-goal pace over 82 games.\n\n11. Joe Thornton's 96 assists. Thornton is one of just five players in NHL history to record at least two different 90-assist seasons. His best performance came during the 2005-06 season (the year he was traded from Boston to San Jose) when he finished with 96 assists on his way to winning the MVP. That total is 16th highest in NHL history. But again, the era matters. Of the top-20 assist seasons ever, 19 of them took place in the decade between 1982 and 1992 when scoring was at an all-time high. Thornton's came 15 years after that.\n\nRandom oddities\n\n12. Gordie Howe scores 15 goals at age 51. I just find this insane. There are only a small handful of players in the history of the league that have ever played a game over the age of 40, and the ones that do are generally not very production. Howe played a full season at the age of 51 and still scored 15 goals while doing so\n\n13. Martin Brodeur appears in 78 games at age 34. The easiest job in the NHL throughout the late 1990s and 2000s was backup goalie for the New Jersey Devils. Brodeur was a workhorse that was going to play as many games as humanly possible, regularly appeared in more than 74 games. He hit his peak during the 2006-07 season he appeared in 78 games, as a goalie, at the age of 34.\n\n14. Dave Schultz's 479 penalty minutes. A record that will probably stand forever. The Broad Street Bullies were a, let's call them, unique team.\n\n15. Jimmy Carson and Bob Kudelski play 86 games. In the early 1990s the NHL briefly expanded its schedule to 84 games to allow teams to play a couple of neutral site games each year to help gauge interest in future expansion. Because of in-season trades Carson and Kudelski both ended up setting new single season records for games played in a season by each appearing in 86 games.\n\n--\n\nAdam Gretz is a writer for Pro Hockey Talk on NBC Sports.

We'll probably just hunker down... and hope that it's all okay.\"\n\nTheir life on the island, where Montagu worked as a clinical psychologist, had been upended as Indonesia started shutting down over the last two weeks in a bid to stop Covid-19 spreading.\n\nWhile Bali officials had requested everyone to stay at home, it did not appear to be heavily enforced, Montagu said.\n\n\"It's not like a full lockdown because I think the risk of doing that would create civil unrest and there are no welfare packages for the local community.\"\n\nDespite a plea from local authorities to stay home religious ceremonies continued to attract large numbers of people, she said.\n\n\"The other day I saw heaps of people on the road wearing masks, but no social distancing.\"\n\nMontagu and her youngest son Benny had planned to return to Auckland on March 16 for a hospital appointment but they had to postpone after the New Zealand government brought in the two-week self isolation requirement, which meant he would have missed it.\n\nEmirates then cancelled their new flights and as Bali's streets emptied and beaches were shut the whole family tried, but failed, to get home.\n\n\"There is one flight that goes to Auckland but it's ridiculously expensive and we haven't got full refunds from Emirates yet.\"\n\nThey decided to wait out the pandemic in Bali, she said.\n\n\"I feel right now its a good place to be.

Survivors generally suffer severe disabilities. The sole currently available therapy, which restores impaired blood flow, has many contraindications. Using in vitro and in vivo stroke models, we show that stimulation of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors shuts off Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor D (VEGFD) expression, causing loss of dendrites. Intraventricular administration of recombinant VEGFD to mice suffering a stroke preserves dendritic architecture, reduces brain damage, and facilitates functional recovery. Similarly, VEGFD mimetics applied nasally prevents stroke-induced damage. Thus, a new neuroprotective approach has been established that preserves neuronal structural integrity through supplementation of VEGFD. It can serve as standalone therapy or complementary medicine to existing treatments of nervous system disorders with structural impairments.","843":"Nationals-themed 'Curly W IPA' unveiled by Devils Backbone Brewing Company By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy\n\nBaseball doesn't appear to be returning anytime soon, but that hasn't stopped Devils Backbone Brewing Company from getting in the spirit of the season.\n\nThe Roseland, Virginia, brewery announced Monday that a new beer would be hitting shelves soon in the D.C.-metro area, and it's got a theme.\n\nAccording to a release from Devils Backbone, \"Curly W is a 6% ABV, 28 IBU crisp and juicy golden IPA that includes Pilsner, Pale Wheat, CaraHell, Golden Naked Oats, Acidulated, Carafa Special 2, and Victory malts - in honor of the 2019 World Series title.

And now he's gone from undrafted rookie to the starting lineup.\n\n\"I feel I'm getting really comfortable,\" Reid said. \"Just staying positive and knowing that everything will be OK even if you do something bad because your teammates have your back and coach has your back. Just go out there and play your all.\"\n\nIt's what Reid has done, whether he has been in Iowa or with the Wolves. Some players may have a hesitancy to shoot in their first stint in the NBA. Reid has been firing away ever since he played his first significant minutes in late December.\n\n\"When I was out and not playing as much minutes, I was just working on my body and running up and down the floor,\" Reid said. \"Just doing things so that when my time was to come, I'll be ready. Those moments helped me for today.\"\n\nThe offensive acumen with Reid has been apparent since he came up. His ability to his three-pointers at a respectable rate can help make him a suitable backup for Towns, who is the best shooting big man in the league from deep. The question for Reid and his long-term viability in the league is defensively, an area in which he's improving, according to teammates and his coach.\n\n\"Naz is still learning,\" coach Ryan Saunders said. \"I'm really happy with Naz's game.

Zeno, 28, has been charged in Scott County District Court with two felony drug counts and is due back in court on April 16.\n\nZeno was charged earlier with similar drug offenses and felony weapons possession after being stopped for speeding in late November with a 2-year-old boy in the back seat, 10 ounces of leafy marijuana, 50 THC cartridges, nine bags of THC gummies, two boxes of cannabis oil, a pistol and ammunition.\n\nHis attorney, Robert Paule, said late Wednesday, \"Mr. Zeno is presumed innocent of all charges and looks forward to clearing his name in court.\"\n\nEdibles infused with cannabis extract have become a popular way to sell marijuana, and many are made where it is legal and then shipped, sold and used in Minnesota and other jurisdictions where the product is illegal.\n\nThey are often packaged to look nearly identical to popular candies, snacks and beverages and may be difficult to distinguish from the real thing. Like vaping products, edibles are often disguised with fruit or candy flavors, which authorities said target children.\n\n\"We need to focus on educating parents, teachers and children to the dangers of the potency of these products and the long-term health risks associated with potential addiction,\" said Scott County Sheriff Luke Hennen.\n\nAccording to the charges and a search warrant affidavit:\n\nOn Feb. 20, law enforcement took trash bags left for pickup outside Zeno's home in the 100 block of W. 6th Street. Inside were glass containers with THC residue and syrup, a cannabis package and other drug-related evidence. THC is the active ingredient in marijuana.\n\nTests on a sample of the illicit drug items seized traced them back to California.\n\nOn Feb. 26, regional drug task-force agents entered the home, arrested Zeno and searched the premises. They located a duffel bag under a bed with 498 Nerd ropes that tested positive for THC.\n\nAlso seized at the scene were two large plastic bags with marijuana packaged for sale, a sandwich bag with leafy marijuana, a wax vial containing THC, a scale and cash.","846":"Nelson Cruz is OK as Twins set lineup for exhibition opener FORT MYERS, Fla. -- Nelson Cruz entered the Twins clubhouse Thursday with his left wrist wrapped up, the result of being plunked by a pitch during batting practice on Wednesday.\n\nBut Cruz got dressed for the workout like it was business as usual.\n\n\"It's going to be fine,\" he said.\n\nCruz was hit by righthander Cody Stashak, who walked one batter in 25 innings last season after being called up to the majors. The ball struck the area where a tendon used to be. That tendon ruptured last season as Cruz took a swing, but he was able to avoid a lengthy stay on the injured list at the time.\n\nSo far, that's the closest the Twins have gotten to having a concerning camp injury. Sergio Romo has been taking it easy with a slightly sore left shoulder while Rich Hill continues to rehab following offseason surgery.\n\nChatted with Royce Lewis for a while today. He's leading off tomorrow for the Twins against the Gophers in an exhibition game here at Hammond. A year ago, Lewis didn't get a chance to show what he can do because of a nagging oblique strain. This year, he's healthy and has added 25 pounds of muscle.\n\nLewis has tried to add a few pounds each offseason by taking in more calories as he works out. He didn't anticipate the spurt he had this offseason, but his shoulders are broader and his biceps are bulging this spring.\n\nA prospect-laden lineup will face the Gophers. Lewis will be followed in the lineup by Alex Kirilloff, Ryan Jeffers, Trevor Larnach, Brent Rooker, Travis Blankenhorn, Gilberto Celestino, Zander Wiel and Jack Reinheimer. Righthander Randy Dobnak will start and be followed by Blaine Hardy, Trevor May, Tyler Duffy, Matt Wisler and others. First pitch is scheduled for 5 p.m. Central.\n\nThe Gophers will fly back to the Twin Cities immediately following the game because they have a series with TCU that begins on Saturday at U.S. Bank Stadium. Minnesota will not bring three of their top pitchers -- Max Meyer, Patrick Frederickson and Sam Thoresen -- to Fort Myers.\n\nEtc.\n\n* Righthander Sergio Romo threw in the bullpen on Wednesday and appears to be over the mild left shoulder separation that led the Twins to keep him from getting on a mound.\n\n* Righthander Kenta Maeda threw a 42-pitch bullpen session on Thursday, with teammates Jake Odorizzi and Michael Pineda providing support and intel on some hitters he will face.\n\nLet's meet\n\nCharlie Barnes, pitcher\n\nAge: 24\n\n2019 Stats: 6-6, 2.81 ERA in 23 starts for Fort Myers.\n\nAcquired: Selected in the fourth round of 2017 draft.\n\nRole: Lefthanded starter at Class A Fort Myers or Class AA Pensacola.\n\nDid you know: Barnes doesn't throw hard, touching around 90 miles per hour. He thrives on precision and a quality changeup that floats in around the 75-77 mph range. He also mixes in a slider and curveball. Barnes graduated from Clemson in three years with a degree in parks, recreation and tourism management. He's the 16th member of his family to earn a degree from the university.","847":"Nelson Cruz, Kenta Maeda to play as Twins play host to the Red Sox FORT MYERS, FLA. -- It has been an entertaining morning so far.\n\nThe Twins are on the field preparing for their game against the Red Sox, the first of five meetings between clubs this spring.

They are found with magnetoencephalography (MEG) (1\u21d3\u21d3-4), EEG (5, 6), and local field potential (LFP) recordings from neocortex (7\u21d3-9) and are preserved across species (10). Local beta oscillations and their coordination between regions are implicated in numerous functions, including sensory perception, selective attention, and motor planning and initiation (2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11\u21d3\u21d3\u21d3-15). Neocortical beta oscillations are disrupted in various neuropathologies, most notably Parkinson's disease (PD), in which treatments that alleviate motor symptoms also reverse the neocortical beta disruption (16, 17). Although associations between beta and performance suggest a crucial role in brain function, beta rhythmicity might not be important per se but instead may be an epiphenomenal consequence of other important processes. Discovering how beta emerges at the cellular and network levels is crucial to understanding why beta is such a clear predictor of performance in many domains.\n\nA major, unresolved point of debate concerns the locus of beta generation. One prominent view is that beta is generated in basal ganglia and thalamic structures and that neocortical beta is an entrained reflection of these inputs. Alternatively, beta may emerge within the neocortex as a consequence of internal dynamics. An intermediate view, supported by the model presented here, is that beta emerges in the neocortex but is dependent on extrinsic synaptic drive that could originate from basal ganglia\/thalamus. Consistent with the first view, beta has been robustly observed in LFP signals from basal ganglia nuclei including the subthalamic nucleus, striatum, and globus pallidus (18, 19), and computational models have proposed mechanisms by which beta rhythms can emerge via interactions within and between these circuits (20, 21). Other studies have suggested that the neocortex itself has unique properties that generate beta rhythms through spike-mediated synaptic and electrical interactions within local circuits (22\u21d3\u21d3-25) or that beta in early-sensory neocortical areas could be driven in a top-down manner from frontal cortex during attentive states (26).\n\nUnderstanding the temporal and spectral nature of a specific beta signal is critical to uncovering its mechanism of generation and its role in the precise local circuit and context in which it is observed. A common view of beta \"rhythms\" is that they are sustained in time for many cycles, up to seconds in duration. The view of beta as a sustained rhythm is consistent with several papers that have reported what appears to be a continuous, high-power increase in beta activity, for example during a planning or \"hold\" period in a motor task or during the allocation of attention in sensory neocortices (2, 27\u21d3-29). Data showing such effects are almost always averaged spectrograms or averaged power spectral density measurements taken from many individual trials aligned to functionally relevant events. However, burst-like or intermittent periods of high beta power occurring stochastically within the time-averaged period could appear as continuous rhythms in averaged spectrograms, despite not ever actually being sustained. Several recent studies have shown that in nonaveraged data beta oscillations often emerge transiently, typically lasting <150 ms (2, 4, 30\u21d3-32).\n\nHere, we combined human MEG, computational neural modeling, and laminar recordings in animals to propose a new theory to explain the origin of spontaneous beta activity that emerges transiently and intermittently in the awake mammalian neocortex. Building on our prior work (1, 2, 15, 33), we studied MEG-measured spontaneous beta activity in two brain areas: (i) primary somatosensory neocortex (SI), where beta emerges as part of the so-called \"mu rhythm\" and typically contains a complex of alpha and beta events, and (ii) frontal cortex, specifically the right inferior frontal cortex (IFC), where beta can be expressed without a strong alpha signal. We previously have shown that beta activity in each of these areas is coordinated, with synchrony in the beta band increasing during inattention (15) and increased beta power in SI predicting failed detection (2).\n\nTo uncover the neural mechanisms specific to beta generation, we first quantified beta's manifestation on individual trials. We verified that beta events in each area were independent of alpha events and were transient in time. Further, we found beta events had a consistent temporal profile. To study the cellular and network level mechanisms creating this beta activity, we used a biophysically principled model of a laminar cortical circuit designed specifically to simulate human MEG\/EEG-measured primary current source signals (1, 34\u21d3\u21d3-37). In keeping the output of our model in close agreement with our MEG data, we arrived at the prediction that these beta events are not inherited linearly from subcortical structures or generated by the spiking interactions in local neocortical circuits. Rather, our data suggest that transient beta events emerge locally in neocortex from the integration of synchronous bursts of subthreshold excitatory synaptic drive that simultaneously target both proximal and distal dendrites of pyramidal neurons (PNs), such that the distal input is sufficiently strong and lasts a beta period.\n\nOur beta theory predicted a specific neocortical laminar current profile during beta events that was supported by laminar recordings in mice and monkeys. In sum, our model accurately reproduces beta events found in SI and in higher-order frontal area IFC and accurately reflects the data generated in distinct species, in distinct recording modalities (MEG and invasive laminar electrophysiological recordings), and in distinct brain states (anesthetized versus awake-behaving).","850":"New French Bakery, one of the Twin Cities' great bread bargains, is closing its retail outlet There's going to be a blip in the ongoing Twin Cities bakery boom.\n\nThe New French Bakery, a staple on the local bread scene for nearly a quarter-century, is calling it quits. The closing date? \"No later than Friday, March 6,\" according to signs posted at the bakery's retail outlet in south Minneapolis.\n\nThere's a simple reason for the closure: The bakery's parent operation, now called Rise Baking Co., is discontinuing its fresh breads, with plans to concentrate on its wholesale frozen bread products.\n\nThe New French Bakery was founded in 1995 by baker Peter Kelsey. It was an outgrowth of the New French Cafe -- where Kelsey once worked, years earlier, as a bus boy -- and operated in a storefront adjacent to the landmark Warehouse District restaurant.\n\nKelsey quickly outgrew the space, eventually building the business into a wholesale operation baking 3 million pounds of bread per month and grossing $40 million in annual sales. In 2013, the U.S. Small Business Administration named Kelsey the Minnesota Small Business Person of the Year.\n\nA month later, Kelsey sold the business to Chicago-based Arbor Investments, a private equity firm that specializes in food-and-beverage concerns.\n\nThe bare-bones, bread-only outlet (2609 26th Av. S., Mpls.) is the open-to-the-public component of a much larger commercial baking operation - formerly an abandoned nightclub -- that employs hundreds of people.\n\nIt's the affordable source for several dozen well-made styles of loaves, from baguettes to sourdough boule, ciabatta to foccacia, pumpernickel Pullman to sesame semolina.\n\nThe store is also home to one of the better bread bargains in town. At the daily \"End of Day Sale\" (4 to 6 p.m. weekdays, 1 to 3 p.m. weekends), any remaining baguettes go for $1 and any $3 items are priced two-for-$5.\n\nThat's not the only deal.

(AP) -- New Mexico school districts, universities, and government agencies have collectively spent millions of dollars to regain control of their computer systems after employees unknowingly opened emails containing an encrypted code that effectively shut them out of their systems.\n\nThe ransomware attacks occurred between January 2018 and February 2020, and have put school districts and agencies on edge amid warnings of more technology terror, the Albuquerque Journal reports.\n\nThe New Mexico victims were not targeted because they were perceived to have an abundance of cash. Instead, they were the victims of a practice called \"phishing,\" in which hackers send out a blanket posting of hundreds or thousands of emails, explained Mary Adkins, supervisory special agent of the cyber squad in the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Albuquerque field office.\n\n\"They're going after school districts, hospitals, health care companies, law enforcement services, governments, individuals, mom, and pop businesses - it's a numbers game for them,\" she said. \"Whatever they get their hooks into, that's what they go after.\"\n\nThe most recent attack victimized the Gadsden Independent School District in February. Computer servers, internet, phones, and email service across all 24 schools were locked out, said district spokesman Luis Villalobos.\n\nTechnicians are now \"scrubbing and reloading about 8,000 individual devices throughout the system -- they have to start from scratch and reboot the entire system on each device,\" he said. \"It's a daunting task and a major inconvenience bordering on a disaster.\"\n\nAnd it's the second time it's happened to the district.\n\nThe most likely cause was a computer that had been infected in the previous July ransomware attack and was reconnected to the network without first having been checked by the technology department, Villalobos said.\n\nNo payroll, personnel, or student data was compromised. The full cost of the recent attack is not yet known, but restoration after the previous attack took four months and set the district back about $1.9 million, he said.\n\nOften, the hackers seek a ransom to be paid in some form of cryptocurrency, which is commonly used on the \"dark web\" to purchase things that may be illegal, Adkins said.\n\nThe value of cryptocurrency fluctuates widely, but a single bitcoin today is worth just under $10,000.\n\nThe FBI investigates ransomware attacks because it's a federal crime involving international wire fraud, as well as a violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.\n\nThe ransomware attacks to the New Mexico entities were of the lockout-only kind and none of the victims reported data or confidential information being compromised. Neither did any of the victims communicate with the hackers, though the ransom of one victim was paid through an insurance company.\n\nIn nearly every case, computer hard drives, servers, files, and devices attached to the system had to be wiped clean by deleting programs and operating systems, then reloading them, a task made easier where there were backup systems that were not attached to the servers and which remained uncorrupted.\n\nAccording to Adkins, the number of ransomware attacks is growing nationally. The same goes for New Mexico, where 15 attacks were reported in 2019 compared to seven in 2018.\n\nSan Miguel County was unable to prevent the ransomware attack last January that locked out 10 computers and compromised its backup system. Still, the computers were up and running quickly because the county purchased insurance, which paid the ransom, said Taylor Horst, risk management director of the New Mexico Association of Counties.\n\n\"We offer a commercial cyber liability insurance policy to our members,\" Horst said. So when the attack occurred, \"San Miguel County called the hotline, the carrier immediately hired a legal firm, and they immediately hired an IT forensics firm that started dealing with the bad guys on the dark web.\"\n\nCopyright 2020 Associated Press.

He created the city's first sushi food truck - Sushi Fix - in 2013, then translated it into a brick-and-mortar location in Wayzata. He sold the restaurant in 2017. (That's Tserenbat, above, at Sushi Fix, in a Star Tribune file photo).\n\nTserenbet has already pinpointed an opening date: May 1, 2020. \"Just going back to making sushi is making me so excited,\" he said. \"Besides my kids and my wife, there is no other pleasure in my life outside of sushi. I'm just thrilled.\"\n\nTserenbat said that building owner and pal Paul Hyde of Hyde Development approached him.\n\n\"He said, 'Hey Billy, I've got this space, can you help me out?\" said Tserenbat. \"I looked at it, and signed a lease. Boom. I'm back in the sushi business.\"\n\nThe building, which is located at 116 1st Av. N. and dates to the 1880s, is an exposed brick-and-timber beauty. The plan is to convert the current bar into a sushi bar, and to transform Sweet Chow's adjacent ice cream shop into a whiskey-sake-shochu bar. The dinner-only setup will have a welcome North Loop perk: complimentary valet parking.\n\nBilly Sushi will be located a half-block from the neighborhood's other sushi bar, Kado No Mise.","854":"New book by Minnesota author channels power of mindfulness and running \"Mindful Running\" makes the case that running and mindfulness are hand-in-glove.\n\nThat heady state of awareness -- of being in the moment -- still has potency as a brand of self-help for our manic times.\n\nA new book by a Minnesota author makes the case that mindfulness and the act of running are hand-in-glove, mixing a powerful elixir of brain training and fitness that can make life (and running) better.\n\nMackenzie Lobby Havey is a frequent contributor to the Star Tribune Outdoors Weekend section and an endurance athlete herself. In \"Mindful Running\" (Bloomsbury), she begins with the foundation that mindfulness is on the same frequency as running.\n\nRunning, one scientist tells her in the book, \"offers him a platform to simply being in the moment, unchained from the others stresses of life.\" Both draw from the same characteristics for success: focus, discipline, structure, repetition.\n\n\"Running gives another avenue for learning these mindfulness principles,\" said Havey in a recent interview.\n\nWhile the buzz about mindfulness seems to have reached critical mass for some, Havey said solid science about its benefits gives the practice an enduring credibility.\n\n\"It might take mindfulness just from a trend to something more long-lasting and substantial because there is empirical evidence showing it is good for us,\" said Havey, who lives in Minneapolis.\n\nSo, while her work might be viewed as a sports book, its content fits in the broader landscape of mindfulness literature, she said.\n\n\"[The concept] applies to anyone who wants to achieve high performance without burning out. How can I make achievement and ambition sustainable?\" she said. \"Mindfulness can help you learn to better listen to your body and be in tune with where your head is at, to know when to push and when to back off.\"\n\nHavey distills interviews with recognizable athletes, neuroscientists and sports psychologists, and frames a guide to marrying mindful ways with lacing up the Asics, whatever the runner's level or pursuits.\n\nWhat follows is an abbreviated version of the book's three-step process of mindful running, with excerpts from the book about its application:\n\nBecome an objective observer and tune into your environment, body and mind in the present moment.\n\n2. Fathom\n\nBased on what you noticed in Step 1, determine if any action is necessary. For example, you might have noticed discomfort, fatigue, or negative thinking. Something like negative thinking only requires you to gently acknowledge the thoughts and then redirect to the present moment. If you're experiencing fatigue or discomfort, that might require further examination to discern whether or not you should back off your run for the day to avoid injury or overtraining.\n\n3. Flow\n\nOnce you've checked in with your environment, body and mind, choose an anchor to the present moment, such as your breath or foot strike. Every time you notice your mind has wandered to the past or future, bring it back to that anchor. This creates focus and concentration, which sets the stage for the flow state.\n\n\"Being fully present is always my goal. If I'm worried about how many miles ahead I have to go or I'm beating myself up for mistakes I made in the miles I've already run, it never goes well for me. Being present is a lost art in our culture today.\" -- Ryan Hall, Olympian, U.S. record holder in the half marathon\n\nResearch out of Harvard found that our minds tend to wander 47 percent of our waking hours, and that when we aren't engaged in the present, we often harbor a negativity bias. When you worry about the future and ruminate about the past on a run, you waste precious energy. For running to be meditative, place your attention on the present moment. Every time you notice your mind has wandered, bring it back to your breath or foot strike.\n\nEmbrace discomfort\n\n\"I've tried using positive mantras and other things, but with pain, you can't fake yourself out. Really tuning into the pain and embracing the struggle is more effective because it dissipates its impact. Pain is in the neurons of the beholder.\" -- Dean Karnazes, professional ultrarunner, New York Times bestselling author\n\nWe have a tendency to check-out as soon as running gets uncomfortable. By bringing awareness to the inherent discomfort that often accompanies running, you're less likely to fall into the trap of chasing down anxious thoughts and catastrophizing the unpleasant sensations associated with physical effort. This helps you to continue pushing forward with intention, rather than reacting emotionally and quitting. Conversely, this present-moment awareness also helps you discern impending injuries, cluing you into when it's important to back off.\n\nGo with the flow\n\n\"I found that as I let go of any expectations and just appreciated the moment, the more focused and aware I was.\" -- Timothy Olson, professional ultrarunner, two-time winner of Western States 100-Mile Race\n\nWhen we are distracted, both enjoyment of an activity and performance take a dive. Mindful awareness has been shown to help create the right conditions for you to enter the flow state, also known as 'getting in the zone.' This is the state where running feels effortless and you perform at your best.\n\nPractice gratitude\n\n\"Even in moments of extreme discomfort in races, I often feel gratitude. I think, 'Wow, this is what it's like to push my limits and I know I'll be stronger and more courageous on the other side.'\u2009\" -- Deena Kastor, three-time Olympian (bronze medalist), American record-holder in the marathon and half marathon\n\nWhen you exist in the moment on a run, you often discover there is much to be grateful for. Whether it's a healthy body capable of movement, beautiful scenery, or a clear and focused mind, a run can be an excellent venue for cultivating gratitude.\n\nExcerpts from \"Mindful Running\" by Mackenzie L.

The quicker an emergency responder can stop the bleeding and replace that blood, the better the chances are for survival. But most bleeding patients do not receive optimal prehospital trauma care, including blood transfusions. That costs lives -- up to 30,000 people a year, according to a 2016 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (1). As noted by the military trauma surgeons who informed that report, the answer to this problem is not necessarily more blood collection, but rather better access to and storage of blood, and, ultimately, production of shelf-stable blood components.\n\nAfter decades of failed trials to create artificial blood, researchers may finally be starting to meet that challenge. Several are looking to create products that serve as a complement to blood -- a sufficient substitute to keep hemorrhaging patients alive until they have access to the real thing. Some researchers are developing freeze-dried versions of blood components; others are looking to create artificial particles that offer replacement components.","857":"News literacy teaching ideas for primary schools Update 23 March 2020: this page will continue to be updated in the coming days to support teachers, young people and families\n\nHow a newspaper is created\n\nFind out about how the Guardian newspaper is made from start to finish: From first word to final edition is an article explaining all the processes.

While Disney initially planned several movies for release in the near future, including Rian Johnson's independent trilogy and Game of Thrones creators D.B. Weiss and David Benioff's film, none of these projects entered production for obvious reasons. Of course, to help fill the void, Lucasfilm has launched a publishing initiative under Star Wars: The High Republic that'll feature all-new stories set some 200 years before the events of Episode I - The Phantom Menace, but what about the future of the franchise on the big screen?\n\nAfter all, even though the fans appreciate the extra content in the form of books and other respective mediums, Star Wars has always been, at its core, a movie series. Well, answering that question is not as simple as you would imagine. Disney originally intended to develop a new film for release in 2022, but amid the recent production halts, even across the MCU, it's likely that the as-of-yet untitled Star Wars movie project will also get delayed.\n\nAnd yet, the Mouse House recently released a revised schedule for its upcoming projects, and while most of them have been shifted to another date, the next major movie in the galaxy far, far away is still set for release on December 16th, 2022.\n\nHopefully, if things begin to slide back into their normal state in the coming months, the next Star Wars movie will continue development unabated, but seeing as how things are turning out for communities around the world in their fight against the deadly disease, we wouldn't really hold our breaths.\n\nAre you excited about the next movie, though? Or do you feel the divisive and lackluster finale of the Skywalker Saga has doomed Disney's hopes of redeeming the franchise?

Yet, our understanding of the interaction among these two types of stressors is limited, hindering efforts to conserve coral reefs. With a large dataset at a seascape scale across Moorea, French Polynesia, we showed that coral bleaching was more severe as both heat stress and nitrogen pollution increased. We also found that corals bleached more severely at comparatively low heat stress if they lived where nitrogen pollution was high. Thus, given that nitrogen pollution worsens the severity of coral bleaching, even during mild heat stress events, there is a critical need to address both local and global threats to coral reefs.\n\nClimate change is increasing the frequency and magnitude of temperature anomalies that cause coral bleaching, leading to widespread mortality of stony corals that can fundamentally alter reef structure and function. However, bleaching often is spatially variable for a given heat stress event, and drivers of this heterogeneity are not well resolved. While small-scale experiments have shown that excess nitrogen can increase the susceptibility of a coral colony to bleaching, we lack evidence that heterogeneity in nitrogen pollution can shape spatial patterns of coral bleaching across a seascape. Using island-wide surveys of coral bleaching and nitrogen availability within a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework, we tested the hypothesis that excess nitrogen interacts with temperature anomalies to alter coral bleaching for the two dominant genera of branching corals in Moorea, French Polynesia. For both coral genera, Pocillopora and Acropora, heat stress primarily drove bleaching prevalence (i.e., the proportion of colonies on a reef that bleached). In contrast, the severity of bleaching (i.e., the proportion of an individual colony that bleached) was positively associated with both heat stress and nitrogen availability for both genera. Importantly, nitrogen interacted with heat stress to increase bleaching severity up to twofold when nitrogen was high and heat stress was relatively low. Our finding that excess nitrogen can trigger severe bleaching even under relatively low heat stress implies that mitigating nutrient pollution may enhance the resilience of coral communities in the face of mounting stresses from global climate change.","864":"No clues to how Godhra man got infected | Vadodara News - Times of India Vadodara: How did the elderly man from Godhra got infected with COVID-19?

However, all residents of the localities will be screened for the virus.\n\nThe administration has now started screening of all residents of these localities after sealing all entry points.\n\nDistrict magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma on Monday said, \"Four localities including Madanpura under the limits of Dashaswamedh police station, Bajardiha under Bhelupur, Gangapur under Mirzamurad and Lohta under the same police station area, have been declared red zone after sealing of all their entry points for 72 hours on Sunday.\"\n\nHe said screening of each member of all families in the areas declared red zone was in progress and any decision for extending the people of sealing the entry points and restricting all kind of movement will be taken after the end of screening process and knowing its outcome.

If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nSpontaneous arousals from sleep are associated with tachycardia and blood pressure responses excessive to physiological need. The prevailing view is that stereotyped autonomic activity is generated by feedforward inputs from cortical and subcortical systems implicated in the arousal, akin to autonomic activation with emotional behavior or cognitive effort. This remains an inadequate explanation, and mechanisms that augment arousal and autonomic functions in sleep remain enigmatic. We identified that swallows trigger rapid, robust, and patterned tachycardia conserved across wake, sleep, and arousal states. Nocturnal swallowing and glottic adduction -- essential airway defense mechanisms -- were also causally linked to prolonged, intense arousals. These findings identify a fundamental mechanism driving both autonomic activation and heightened arousal via cortical feedback from brainstem swallow networks.","868":"North Loop nabs Madewell denim test store, only the 3rd in the country While J.

The Twin Cities has Madewell locations in Southdale and Mall of America, but the brand can also be found in Nordstrom.\n\nDenim accounted for nearly 30% of Madewell's total sales in 2018. It's such an integral part of the brand started in 2006 that J. Crew's former CEO Mickey Drexler once said he wanted to make Madewell's jeans, which sell for $100 to $150, the Levi's of its generation.\n\nOne of the characteristics of the brand is sustainability. Customers can get 20% off a pair of jeans if they trade in a pair at purchase. The denim can also be personalized, including stamping and leather monogramming.\n\nThe store will be located at 124 N. 3rd Ave. in Minneapolis. Also debuting next year in the neighborhood will be West Elm home furnishings, AxeBridge Winery, Billy Sushi restaurant and Fillmore Minneapolis concert hall.\n\nOne of the Twin Cities' hottest, hippest neighborhoods, it also saw plenty of openings this year. This list includes Lululemon and Requisite women's clothing, plus restaurants Demi and Graze and North Loop Galley food hall. Floyd's 99 Barbershop, Frgmnt coffee and One Fermentary & Taproom also debuted this year.\n\nJ. Crew still has full-price stores in St. Paul and Rosedale and Southdale malls. Outlet stores are located in the Shoppes at Knollwood in St. Louis Park and Twin Cities Premium Outlets in Eagan. Locations closed in Mall of America and Maple Grove.","869":"Not The Time For Post-Mortem, Says Jhulan Goswami After India Women's T20 World Cup Loss | Cricket News Former India captain Jhulan Goswami is certainly disappointed with India's defeat at the hands of Australia but feels that this is not the right time to do a \"post-mortem\" of the abject surrender. The Meg Lanning-led side put up a dominant show to notch 184\/4 and in reply, India meekly surrendered for 99 to title in front of a capacity crowd of 86,174. \"It's very disappointing. But don't forget that they made us proud in this World Cup. But it's not the time to do a post-mortem. They would be very heartbroken and as Indians we need to stand by them now,\" Jhulan told PTI on Sunday. \"I feel very proud for every player in the team.\n\nThey have done extremely well and made India proud. Remember they had beaten Australia in the group stage,\" the legendary pacer said.\n\nThe 37-year-old Jhulan said that one important aspect that should be taken into account is the age factor. \"Please do remember that India had the youngest team in the World Cup in terms of average age.\n\nThere were three players aged between 16 to 19 (19-year-old Jemimah Rodrigues, 16 year-olds Shafali Verma and Richa Ghosh). They will learn a lot of things and they are the future of Indian cricket,\" she said.\n\nIndia were hugely let down big time by their skipper Harmanpreet, who had a forgettable tournament with 30 runs (2, 8, 1, 15 and 4) from five outings at an average of 6.\n\n\"In such a tournament, every player has pressure. Maybe, she is going through an inconsistent phase. She didn't get runs.\n\nPeople talk if you don't get runs in a big tournament.\n\nBut we all know what her calibre is. It's not the right time to talk about her performance.\"\n\nJhulan would rather like to harp on positives rather than picking on Harmanpreet.\n\n\"It's time to see how she led the team despite her poor run. She stood there for the players and fought well. She is obviously a good leader and has led the team from the front. They will definitely come out strong.\"\n\nIndia's newest batting sensation Shafali Verma dropped a regulation catch off Healy, something that proved to be costly for India.\n\n\"She's just a 16-year-old girl, who made her debut six months ago and she's now no 1 ranked player in ICC list. We must back her. And missing catches is a part of the game.\" Bengal youngster Richa Ghosh, who made her debut in the preceding Triseries final against Australia, played two matches in the T20 World Cup and made 18 in the final.\n\n\"Richa looked very confident. She has a positive intent. I'm really happy for her,\" Jhulan hailed. The speedster attributed Australia's dominating show to their strong grassroots level cricket.\n\n\"Australia have much positive cricket. Obviously their grassroots level cricket much ahead of us. We are slowly getting there. These are all part of a learning process.\"\n\nThe final, which coincided with the International Women's Day, also witnessed the highest attendance for a women's sporting event in Australia.\n\n\"It's a huge achievement for women's cricket. We must appreciate the Cricket Australia and International Cricket Council,\" Jhulan hailed.","870":"Not all heat cable is created equal This is a guest blog post by Steve Kuhl of Radiant Solutions Company. This is the second in a three-part series.\n\nOver the past 30 years, I've been asked countless times if heat cables are a good solution or a bad solution for ice dams. My answer has always been, \"Yes\". They are a great solution when you use the right cable and a bad solution if you don't. Heat cables are a controversial topic in the field of ice dam prevention for good reason. They can be inefficient, short-lived, ineffective and even pose a fire hazard in some situations.\n\nBut to be clear, all of these issues relate to installations involving a low-quality class of cables known as 'Constant-Wattage', which are usually bought on Amazon or at big-box retailers and installed by less-than-professional hands. Constant-wattage cable gets its name from the fact that--unlike self-regulating cable--it does not automatically adjust its energy consumption with changes in outdoor temperatures. It is hot, hot, hot, 100% of the time when plugged in. There are many other dubious distinctions described below.\n\nSadly, constant-wattage heat cable is the most widely used roof deicing cable in the country, accounting for roughly 90% of all residential installations and nearly 100% of all complaints. Based on my many years of experience in ice dam prevention and residential construction, my opinion on constant-wattage cable is clear: It is better to not install anything than to use these products on your home. This explains why 60% of the heat tape installations we do in the Minneapolis area involve tearing out constant-wattage and replacing it with self-regulating cable, even on systems less than a year old. Bummer.\n\nCost: A 100-foot constant-wattage cable will cost you around $75 whereas a self-regulating cable of the same length will be closer to $350. Ultimately, being cheap is the only short-term advantage constant-wattage cable has over self-regulating cable. Self-regulating cable is far cheaper over the long run when lifespans and energy consumption are factored in. If the cable feels very affordable, it is probably because it's cheap.\n\nDimension & Brand Names: How does the average person tell the difference between self-regulating cable and constant-wattage cable? Here are a few quick tips. Identifying constant-wattage cable visually is easy. It's normally black and round, measuring about \u00bc\" in diameter and is usually sold under the brand names of Frost King, EasyHeat, Wrap-On or Heat-It.\n\nConstant-wattage cables are typically the only option at local hardware stores both large and small. In contrast, self-regulating cables are normally \u00bc\" x \u00bd\", similar in shape to standard Romex\u00ae wire used in American homes. For all of our installations, we use Heat Tape Pro, a commercial-grade self-regulating heat cable that carries a five-year manufacturer's warranty.\n\nPerformance & Limitations: A quick review of the manual and marketing materials will tell you quite a bit about constant wattage cable including these crucial limitations that few people are aware of:\n\nSelf-regulating heat cables were originally developed over 50 years ago for use in arctic oil fields to prevent pipelines from freezing. It's a robust technology with many years of proven effectiveness. It has a special conductive core that asks for more energy in response to cold and less when temperatures are warmer. In other words, it 'self-regulates'. Here are some benefits to self-regulating heat cables:\n\nAfter all of these years in the ice dam, roofing and remodeling industries I still find myself coming back to this natural law in home maintenance: The solution is always about the budget. If you have a lot to spend you will choose one path, if you have a tighter wallet you will choose another. In terms of ice dams, I'm afraid there aren't always 'cheap' solutions. Homeowners must sometimes choose from the lesser of three evils: 1) Spend a lot on architectural enhancements, 2) Spend a lot on professional roof shoveling or risk a lot doing it themselves or, 3) Spend a fair amount on heat cables. The average self-regulating heat cable system we install in the Minneapolis area runs between $1,000 and $2,000.\n\nMy advice to anyone considering heat cable for ice dam prevention is to either install a high-quality, self-regulating heat cable or skip it altogether. Constant wattage heat cable is a total waste of money. Worse, it can create a false sense of security for people who have most likely already had a bad relationship with ice dams in the past.\n\nNext week I will be writing a follow-up post that discusses how to install a long-lasting heat cable system, including design, materials, expected costs and installation tips.","871":"Novel by Minneapolis writer Kate DiCamillo to be a musical in London A good writer's prose can sometimes be described as musical.

In the old centre, around the southern canal belt, there are these beautiful 17th-century merchants' houses that 21st-century Amsterdammers still live in. I've always thought it wears its historical cloak quite casually and doesn't just dwell in the past.\n\nThe Rijksmuseum is stunning and I love it as a fascinating, cool, accessible museum, as well as for the part it played in inspiring The Miniaturist. I came across Petronella Oortman's doll's house there by chance. It's an exact scale replica of her real home, and Oortman spent a fortune having it created. I thought at the time it was an interesting story, but I didn't think I was going to write a novel about it. I'm in its debt, really.\n\nThe city battles the image created by stag and hen party trips. I didn't visit until 2009 and so I had the idea of it just being the place where people went to smoke weed without being arrested. You know, the preconception: \"It's going to be full of stoned tourists with their faces in the gutter.\" But it's not been like that at all.\n\nStroll through the Nine Streets of the Jordaan area and it's like walking on to a film set. It's one of the nicest, most peaceful walks in the city. The area is full of old shops - ice-cream parlours, trinket shops, bookstores - and it has a fantastic atmosphere.\n\nI explored the suburbs when visiting Amsterdam's Tram Museum and ended up seeing the 1928 Olympic Stadium and the huge Amsterdamse Bos forest park. My boyfriend and I jumped on an old tram (\u20ac5 return) at Haarlemmermeerstation and took it to the suburb of Amstelveen. You can hire bicycles there and cycle into the forest.\n\nRenting helped me feel more like a local, that's for sure. The owner of an apartment I rented on the Herengracht through CityMundo was a traveller and an adventurer. She had left her place furnished and it was filled with seashells she'd collected and had shelves brimming with 17th-century books. It was amazing. CityMundo rents houseboats, houses and apartments. If you're after a nice, but not too expensive, hotel, I'd recommend Hotel Vondel (doubles from \u00a350) on Vondelstraat; it's not far from Leidseplein and the city centre.\n\nForget bowls of crisps and nuts for nibbles, at De Kas they serve tiny yellow and red tomatoes from their garden covered in an amazing garnish. I had my 30th birthday at this wonderful restaurant in a massive greenhouse near Frankendael Park. It's beautifully laid out, with fruit and vegetable gardens and you sit and eat overlooking them.\n\nThe sunset when you're at the top of the REM Eiland island restaurant is dramatic, just like the food. My publisher took me for dinner here when The Miniaturist came out in the Netherlands. It's actually a former helicopter deck and you climb up and up and up, and are then rewarded with extraordinary views of the waterfront and port areas.\n\nFor an immediate food fix, I love the poffertjes (tiny pancakes) that they griddle in sets of 10 at Albert Cuyp market. They just chuck butter and icing sugar all over them and they are the most unbelievable thing. Mind you, throwing sugar and butter at most treats usually does the trick!\n\nDuring the winter the bar T'smalle is a peaceful place to be. It's in an old house which is right on the Egelantiersgracht canal and is just so cosy and beautiful, with all its lights twinkling. In summer, everyone sits outside on the canalside terrace. It's a cool place to have a beer or a glass of wine in the evening.\n\nThe waterfront of the Eastern Islands area is beautiful and offers a much quieter experience than all the hustle and bustle of the city centre. Historically, the harbour had been used by the Dutch East India Company but the area had fallen into disrepair until it was redeveloped in the early 2000s; it now has the Nemo science centre, nice new apartments and cafe-bars.\n\nThe Vondelpark, in the south of the city, is perfect if you're after a chilled and sedate place to hang out. It's worth exploring for the architecture - it was created in 1865, so happy 150th birthday. It's a relaxing place with a lake, a performance space and cafes.\n\nThe light plays beautifully on the canals when the sun hits the water. Even on wintry days it's still atmospheric. I enjoy seeing the city from a canal boat, especially the Gouden Bocht (Golden Bend) between Leidsestraat and Vijzelstraat. It's lovely to see the houseboats bobbing and people going past on their bicycles, as well as all the extraordinary houses.\n\nI've got this little house on my mantelpiece: it's a nightlight in the shape of an Amsterdam townhouse. I love it because it's a visual reminder of my trips there and the house in my book in a way ... and because it gives off a very nice glow.\n\n* Jessie Burton's image research for the book is on Pinterest, containing source material and photos taken in Amsterdam.The Miniaturist is published by Picador, price \u00a37.99.

But it's not our only responsibility By Jes\u00fas A. Tirado March 23, 2020 Printer-Friendly Email Article Reprints Comments\n\nIt is safe to say that social distancing has become part of our new daily lexicon. It's important to know that this is saving people's lives, but I want us all to recognize that in this world of social distancing, we do not need to continue our practice of spectator democracy that keeps us sitting on the sidelines while others make the important decisions for us.\n\nIn the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing is a form of civic duty, something we are doing to protect the most vulnerable of our society. We've given up March Madness for social media tags like #stayhome and #stayhomesavelives that build solidarity around our shared stories of staying in. And while we think about what we've lost, we are hoping that we can hold on to something much more important: each other.\n\n\"Let's use our social distancing time to become better and more informed navigators of the world.\"\n\nWhen we are all stuck at home, it may seem like the wrong time to talk about political and civic engagement. After all, attending campaign rallies with other people, organizing petitions, and canvassing neighbors feel like the last things we should be doing. But since we'll all be alone together (or #alonetogether -- another popular social media tag for connecting stories of social distancing), I thought I'd offer some ways for us to remain politically engaged.\n\nIt is essential that we maintain our commitment to protect each other. We must ground ourselves in the kindness we've already shown each other as we think about and guard the more vulnerable members of our society. We need to think critically about the news that we are consuming and then begin to ask ourselves what we can do to make sure our society continues to protect those who need it the most.\n\nSee Also: Coronavirus and Schools\n\nFirst, let us take this time to think about how we are consuming information and where it is coming from. Who is saying what? Where are reporters getting their information? Who are the quoted experts? Question what's going on and trace it back to the source.\n\nPlaces like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering both share their data on the pandemic and allow users to explore some of that data. Take time to peel back some of the layers and get to information instead of letting headlines and social media posts dictate how you feel. Having information and looking at sources can help with all the changes that are surely coming. Let's use our social distancing time to become better and more informed navigators of the world.\n\nThe other piece of advice that I offer is to be kind to yourself and everyone else. We're all making huge adjustments and asking difficult questions with no easy answers. We are all finding our lives to be more precarious than we previously thought. Even as we are missing our teachers who can no longer take care of our kids, those same teachers are reaching out through the internet to help. Retailers are asking that we minimize our footprint in their stores to keep the aisles clean and safe for those who need food and to stay healthy.\n\nMore Opinion\n\nFollow Opinion here.\n\nLet us be honest that we are in a time where we are answering a crisis with bold action -- and let's remember how that sacrifice feels so that we can build a kinder society when the pandemic passes. We are giving up comforts for the lives of others. We can do this again when our old normal returns. We can make changes to ease the precariousness of those who are suffering from the virus and its many ramifications, but it starts with asking questions.\n\nIn the meantime, I hope I see you being politically active and civic-minded. Take care of yourself. Check in with friends, families, and colleagues. Practice self-care and good hygiene. Support local businesses, tip if you can, and be kind.\n\nJes\u00fas A.

Grasshopper abundances in a North American prairie exhibited both 5-y cycles and >2%\/y declines over the past 20 y. Large-scale climate oscillations predicted the cycles in grasshopper abundances. Moreover, plant biomass doubled over the same period -- likely due to changes in climate and increasing atmospheric CO2 -- diluting the concentrations in plant tissue of key nutrients which in turn predicted the declines of a dominant herbivore. Nutrient dilution, like CO2 enrichment, is likely a global phenomenon, posing a challenge to Earth's herbivore populations.\n\nEvidence for global insect declines mounts, increasing our need to understand underlying mechanisms. We test the nutrient dilution (ND) hypothesis -- the decreasing concentration of essential dietary minerals with increasing plant productivity -- that particularly targets insect herbivores. Nutrient dilution can result from increased plant biomass due to climate or CO enrichment. Additionally, when considering long-term trends driven by climate, one must account for large-scale oscillations including El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). We combine long-term datasets of grasshopper abundance, climate, plant biomass, and end-of-season foliar elemental content to examine potential drivers of abundance cycles and trends of this dominant herbivore. Annual grasshopper abundances in 16- and 22-y time series from a Kansas prairie revealed both 5-y cycles and declines of 2.1-2.7%\/y. Climate cycle indices of spring ENSO, summer NAO, and winter or spring PDO accounted for 40-54% of the variation in grasshopper abundance, mediated by effects of weather and host plants. Consistent with ND, grass biomass doubled and foliar concentrations of N, P, K, and Na -- nutrients which limit grasshopper abundance -- declined over the same period. The decline in plant nutrients accounted for 25% of the variation in grasshopper abundance over two decades. Thus a warming, wetter, more CO-enriched world will likely contribute to declines in insect herbivores by depleting nutrients from their already nutrient-poor diet. Unlike other potential drivers of insect declines -- habitat loss, light and chemical pollution -- ND may be widespread in remaining natural areas.","875":"O'Reilly announces certification guides for the most in-demand IT and professional certifications O'Reilly's streamlined experience features a single destination for certification preparation and interactive practice exams\n\nBOSTON -- March 2, 2020 -- O'Reilly, the premier source for insight-driven learning on technology and business, today announced new complete sets of preparation materials to help users achieve the most sought-after certifications necessary for today's IT and InfoSec professionals.

Walker Octavia Spencer is all business in a new miniseries. | \u2605\u2605\u2605 out of 4 stars\n\nIf the future of the James Bond franchise ends up in the hands of Lashana Lynch, then producers should consider also casting a woman as the supervillain. And put Octavia Spencer at the top of the wish list.\n\nThat may seem like a bizarre suggestion, considering the actor is best known for playing sympathetic underdogs. Her latest project, \"Self Made: Inspired by the Life of Madam C.J. Walker,\" is no exception.\n\nThe miniseries, now available on Netflix, covers the professional life of Walker, who became wealthy in the early part of the last century from selling cosmetics and hair-care products for black women.\n\nBut over the course of four fast-paced hours, \"Self Made\" only offers one surefire business tip: Speak loudly and carry a big stick. Better yet, a small pistol.\n\nThe first episode, directed by Kasi Lemmons (\"Harriet\"), imagines Walker in a boxing ring, figuratively jabbing back at those who dare to get in her way, most notably a rival entrepreneur who dismissed her ability based on looks alone.\n\n\"Even in your Sunday best, you look like you just stepped off the plantation,\" says Addie Monroe, a fictionalized version of real-life mogul Annie Malone, played with too-cool-for-school 'tude by Carmen Ejogo.\n\nWalker's counterpunches are formidable -- and it's hard to imagine any other actress delivering with them such ferocity.\n\nWhen Walker's husband (Blair Underwood) suggests that they celebrate a breakthrough with a steak dinner, she responds with a stare that could set a sirloin on fire.\n\nA request to hobnob with wives rather than seek an audience with Booker T. Washington triggers Spencer to raise her eyebrows so high that you may need a bigger TV set to follow them.\n\n\"I didn't come here to make sandwiches,\" she says with the kind of steely grit that would compel Bond to order a triple martini. \"I came to do business.\"\n\nSpencer has shown us she's a force to be reckoned with in previous films.\n\nIn \"Snowpiercer,\" Bong Joon-ho's underappreciated thriller, she channels Bruce Willis while barreling through a train in search of her son.\n\nIn \"Hidden Figures,\" a rah-rah tribute to the black female mathematicians who played a key supporting role in the Space Race, she stuns a condescending policeman by repairing her own broken-down car.\n\nShe won an Oscar for playing the maid in \"The Help\" who gets revenge on a racist socialite by adding an unspeakable ingredient to a pie.\n\n\"Self Made\" ultimately wants Walker to be as beloved as those cinematic saints -- and that's too bad. The character is so much more interesting when Spencer dares viewers not to fully embrace her with open arms.\n\nShe's a bully and a thief. Her desire to be as rich as Ford, Carnegie and Rockefeller put together is overwhelming. When her exasperated husband finally cheats on her, you may find yourself wondering what took him so long.\n\nThe series could have used a few more of these moments. I could also have spent more time with Walker's loyal daughter, Lelia, if only because she's played with such quirky charm by Tiffany Haddish.\n\nIn one memorable moment, she dumps her two-timing husband while doing a jig on the sidewalk, a move you'd never see from Spencer.

A rampaging Australia under Steve Waugh headed to Kolkata for the second Test having thrashed India by 10 wickets in the first match in Mumbai. Between August 1999 and February 2001, Australia won 16 straight Tests, and before this series they beat India 3-0 on home soil in the summer of 1999-2000.\n\nBut at Eden Gardens, something surreal happened.\n\nAustralia had scored 445 in their first innings on the back of captain Steve Waugh's 110 and 97 from Matthew Hayden, however it was Harbhajan Singh who stole the show, claiming 7\/123 including the first hat-trick in India's Test history.\n\nAustralia continued their surge despite Harbhajan's heroics, bundling out the home side for 171 in reply, with Glenn McGrath taking 4\/18.\n\nWaugh's men looked good to be marching to a 17th straight Test win after enforcing the follow-on. India were reduced to 3\/115 and then 4\/232 in their second innings - still trailing by 42 with just six wickets in hand when VVS Laxman and Rahul Dravid joined hands.\n\nThe pair famously shared a 376-run stand for the fifth wicket, and put their team 334 runs in front.\n\nVVS Laxman scored a career-best 281, while Dravid added 180.\n\nSet an improbable 384 to win in little more than two sessions on day five, Australia were outfoxed by Harbhajan, who added six wickets to his seven from the first dig and rounded out one of Test cricket's most famous victories.","882":"On This Day In 2012, Sachin Tendulkar Scored His 100th International Century | Cricket News March 16, 2012, will be etched in the minds of cricket fans across the globe as the day when legendary India batsman Sachin Tendulkar scored his 100th international century. Popularly known as the 'God of Cricket', Tendulkar's record remains unbroken. During the Asia Cup clash against Bangladesh at the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium, Tendulkar played a brilliant knock of 114 to bring up his 49th ODI century. The maestro already had 51 hundreds to his name in the longest format of the game. His century was also special in the sense that Tendulkar breached the three-figure mark after a gap of one year.\n\nHowever, Tendulkar's knock was not enough to seal victory for India as they were unable to defend a target of 290 and the hosts won the match with four balls to spare.\n\nThe century record of Tendulkar, who bid adieu to international cricket in 2013, still stands untouched. The 47-year-old also has 164 fifties to his name while he amassed a whopping 34,357 runs during his stellar career.\n\nFormer Australia skipper Ricky Ponting, with 71 hundreds, comes second in the list of players with most international centuries. Current India skipper Virat Kohli is at the third spot with 70 international hundreds and he is the only one who seems to be in line to break Tendulkar's record of 100 hundreds.","883":"On bone fatigue and its relevance for the design of architected materials This article requires a subscription to view the full text.

Below the veranda some youths had been playing noisily on the harbour wall, but now they all dived into the turquoise sea and set off on the long swim to the rocky island in the bay. It had a fragment of crenellated wall on top of it, the ruins of a Venetian fortress. Fotis watched them go, half-smiling.\n\n\"We do seem to attract a lot of writers,\" said the old man eventually. \"But that's a name I don't remember.\"\n\n\"Bruce Chatwin, Baroose Chit-win, Chaatwing.\" I tried a few variations but none struck a chord. \"His ashes are scattered somewhere in the hills.\"\n\n\"No, I never heard of him.\"\n\n\"What about Sir Patrick Leigh Fermor? You must know about him.\"\n\nI'd first heard of Kardamyli because of Leigh Fermor, who had made the place his home. I'd always hoped we might meet, but then the grand old man of British travel writing had died in June 2011 (leaving the literary world praying that he had finished the final volume of his Time of Gifts trilogy). I'd come to the Mani on a sort of literary homage, hoping to find a little of the magic that had attracted first Leigh Fermor and later Chatwin.\n\nThe old man shook his head. \"No, I don't think so. There was a writer called Robert. Now he was famous - cured himself of cancer by walking around Crete. [Former South Africa cricketer Bob Crisp wrote of his walk around Crete in the 1970s.] He was very famous.\"\n\nThis felt all wrong. Was I in the right place? How annoying that the locals should raise this unknown above the two giants of travel literature.\n\nFotis leaned back and shouted in Greek to his wife in the kitchen. She came through, cloth in hand. \"Robert Crisp,\" she said, smiling. \"What a wonderful man! So handsome! I remember him sitting up at Dioskouri's taverna drinking and talking with Paddy. They were always laughing.\"\n\nMy ears pricked up. Fotis's face underwent a transformation. \"Ah Paddy! That is him - your English writer. Of course, Paddy - or Michali we called him. Yes, Paddy was here for years and years. When I was young we used to say he was a British spy and had a tunnel going out to sea where submarines would come.\"\n\nIt didn't surprise me. Leigh Fermor had been, by all accounts, extremely old school, endlessly curious and an accomplished linguist - all well-known attributes of British spies. He produced a clutch of good books and two classics of the genre, A Time of Gifts and Between the Woods and the Water, detailing his journey as an 18-year-old on foot to Constantinople.\n\n\"Did you see a lot of him?\" I asked.\n\nFotis shrugged. \"Sometimes. He liked to walk a lot. Now Robert Crisp - I used to see him. What a character!\"\n\n\"Is Paddy's house still empty?\" I persisted. \"I heard it was now a museum.\"\n\nFotis shook his head. \"No, no. He left it to the Benaki Museum in Athens (benaki.gr) and they're supposed to turn it into a writers' centre. My guess is nothing will happen for a while.\"\n\nI could hardly complain about Greek tardiness: Leigh Fermor himself had taken 78 years over his trilogy, and even then no one seemed very sure if he had completed the task. There was, I decided, only one way to get close to the spirit of these colossi of travel-writing: to walk.\n\n\"Which paths did Paddy like best?\"\n\nFotis fetched a map and gave me directions. It was already hot when I left him on his veranda. I could see the youths lazing on the harbour wall again, tired by their long swim. Was this really the time of year for walking?\n\nI headed through the ruined village, as instructed, and found a narrow steep path rising up the hillside. Before too long I came across the stone tomb that locals say is the grave of Castor and Pollux, heavenly twins and brothers to Helen of Troy. Kardamyli is mentioned in Homer's Iliad as one of the seven towns that Agamemnon gave to Achilles.\n\nSweat was pouring off me now, but I kept going. Scents of thyme and sage rose from the undergrowth. Fotis had said there were lots of snakes up here, but I didn't see any. The views of the bay below, however, were becoming more and more magnificent.\n\nThe Mani is the middle finger of the three-pronged southern Peloponnese, a 40-mile long skeletal digit that was almost inaccessible, except by sea, until recently. When Leigh Fermor first came here in 1951, it was by a marathon mountain hike across the Taygetus range, whose slopes seem always to be either burned dry by summer sun, or weighted with winter snow.\n\nThe people here were different. For a start they had turned vengeance into a lifelong passion, building war towers to threaten their neighbours and generally making life on a stony mountain even grimmer than it needed to be and clinging to weird atavistic beliefs. No wonder that in the 1950s most of the younger people abandoned it for places not as badly infested with saltwater ghouls and blood-sucking phantoms - Melbourne and Tottenham were particularly popular.\n\nFotis himself had been one of them, settling in Australia for many years before coming home and opening a hotel. Nowadays some parts of the Mani are thick with holiday homes and development, but Kardamyli remains delightfully quiet and understated, the sort of Greek village where old widows in black sit out every morning watching the world go by.\n\nHaving reached a good height on the mountain I started to follow the contours, dipping in and out of the shade of walnut trees and cypress, drinking clear cold water from a spring. Further on I came to the village of Proastio, where Fotis had told me there was a church for every family, the ancestors having been sailors, and very superstitious. At the gorgeous little basilica of Agios Nikolaos in the main street I got the priest to come and unlock the door, revealing a gallery of perfect 17th-century Byzantine murals.\n\nI tried the name Chatwin on him, and wondered how to mime death, cremation and scattering of ashes. But the Orthodox Church does not approve of cremation and his face told me I would not get far.\n\nReturning to Kardamyli by a steep cobbled donkey trail, a kalderimi, I passed Fotis's veranda once again.\n\n\"Who was that writer?\" he called. \"My wife thinks she knows.\"\n\nAnna came out. \"Paddy himself scattered the ashes of a writer friend of his, up in Exochori.\"\n\nThat was where I had just been walking, only higher. Next morning I started much earlier and with a water bottle. Fotis was already up and about when I passed his house.\n\n\"Exochori is my home village,\" he said. \"But what you see now is just old people up there. The old Maniati culture is gone. We used to grow silkworms and our mothers made all our underclothes from it. Can you believe it? We were peasants in the most remote part of Europe, but we wore silk.\"\n\nHe tried to give me directions to the church, but it got so confusing that I just pretended to understand and resolved to ask along the way. As it happened, this was a useless strategy since the few old people I bumped into spoke no English, and my phrasebook was inexplicably silent on the important line, \"Where are scattered the remains of the travel writer?\"\n\nIn the end I came across a small white-washed shrine with a view of the sea. There was just room to enter, and inside a votive candle burned on a tray with some fresh flowers. A white dog appeared. I elected to call it the Chatwin Church. After a few minutes of contemplation I set off again, southwards past one of the war towers, a gorgeous forest monastery and finally the unspoilt hamlet of Castania, where the taverna owner marched me into the kitchen, pointed out the various dishes and then served a vast quantity of delicious food with a jug of rough wine. It took several strong coffees to get me moving again for the long tramp home.\n\nBack in Kardamyli late that afternoon, Fotis was keen to hear of my walk, but he scoffed at my description of the Chatwin Church. \"No, no! That is not it. Come on - I'll take you there.\"\n\n\"I'm a bit tired.\"\n\n\"Good God, we're not walking! In my car.\"\n\nSoon we were on a longer, twisting route. Fotis pointed out landmarks and patches of land that his family owned. I asked about his ancestors.\n\n\"The Mani was always where people came to hide,\" he said. \"Our family are said to have arrived when Byzantium fell to the Ottomans in 1453.\"\n\n\"They came from Constantinople?\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Our family tradition is that we were clowns for the Byzantine emperor.\" He smiled. \"But I've no idea if that is true.\"\n\nHe slowed the car down. \"Look. This is where you turn off the main road, between the school and the cemetery.\"\n\nWe pulled up in the shade of two pine trees then set off walking. We picked our way through some old stone houses, their walls overgrown with vines, their shutters closed.\n\n\"Holiday homes now,\" said Fotis. \"Exochori people working in Athens.\"\n\nThen we were on a grassy rill of land and I could see the church, a tiny Byzantine basilica, its rough stone walls and ancient pantiles crusted with lichens. Laid out before it was a wonderful tranquil panorama of the sea, its surface smooth as a sheet of silk. It was obvious why a traveller would want to come to rest here, overlooking the sea Homer's heroes had sailed.\n\nI stood there for a long time. Fotis was searching for the key to the church, normally left in a crack or niche, but there was no sign of it and we gave up. Back in the car, I asked Fotis to point out the house of Paddy Leigh Fermor and glimpsed a low pantiled roof almost submerged in trees on a crag next to the sea.\n\n\"Is there no way to see it?\"\n\nHe shrugged. \"It's all shut up.\"\n\n\"Is there a beach?\"\n\n\"Yes - a tiny one.\"\n\nI memorised the spot. When Leigh Fermor came to the Mani he did some impressive wild swimming. To honour his adventurous spirit I felt I should swim around to his house and take a look. So next morning, before the heat of day, I entered the sea by the harbour and swam south down the rocky coast hunting for that tiny beach. I swam for what seemed a long time and had given up and turned back when I saw it: a little shingly beach with a single-storey house above. I swam closer until I could stand in the water.\n\nIt was a lovely place: deep verandas and stone walls under a pantile roof. Mosaics of pebbles had been made on a flight of steps. I called out but got no answer. The house was shuttered and quiet as though still in mourning. I waded up the beach and sat at the foot of the pebble path. I could see a colonnade with rooms off it, then a larger living room.\n\nI thought of the years that Leigh Fermor had spent here: by all accounts he was a great host and storyteller. When I'd asked one old lady in the village if she had read any of his books, she'd laughed, \"Why would any of us read his books? He told us all the stories himself!\"\n\nThe last story had been that third volume of his epic walk across Europe, but he had never finished it, perhaps never would have. And now a great peace had descended on the place, a peace I didn't want to disturb. I walked back down to the water and swam out into the bay. Without thinking, I found myself heading for the island of Meropi, the one that those youths had swum to. I would explore the ruins of that Venetian castle.\n\nHow to do it\n\nThe trip was provided by Sunvil (020-8758 4758, sunvil.co.uk\/greece), which has seven nights self-catering in a studio at Liakoto Apartments in Kardamyli, including flights from Gatwick to Kalamata and transfers, from \u00a3699pp. Walking tours of the Mani with guide Anna Butcher can be booked through Sunvil, which also has a nine-day all-inclusive walking tour of the Mani for \u00a31,755pp\n\nWhat to read\n\nArtemis Cooper's biography, Patrick Leigh Fermor, An Adventure, will be published by John Murray on 11 October, price \u00a325.

Through another gap our host's second daughter, wide-hatted and perched on the back of a wooden sledge and grasping three reins, was sliding round and round a threshing floor behind a horse, a mule and a cow - the first cow I had seen in the Mani - all of them linked in a triple yoke. On a bank above this busy stone disc, the rest of the family were flinging wooden shovelfuls of wheat in the air for the grain to fall on outstretched coloured blankets while the husks drifted away. Others shook large sieves. The sun which climbed behind them outlined this group with a rim of gold and each time a winnower sent up his great fan, for long seconds the floating chaff embowered him in a gold mist.\n\nThe sun poured into this stone casket through deep embrasures. Dust gyrated along the shafts of sunlight like plankton under a microscope, and the room was full of the aroma of decay. There was a rusty double-barrelled gun in the corner, a couple of dog-eared Orthodox missals on the shelf, and, pinned to the wall above the table, a faded oleograph of King Constantine and Queen Sophia, with King George and the Queen Mother, Olga Feodorovna, smiling with time-dimmed benevolence through wreaths of laurel. Another picture showed King Constantine's entry into re-conquered Salonika at the end of the Balkan war. On a poster, Petro Mavromichalis, the ex-war minister, between a pin-up girl cut-out from the cover of Romantzo and a 1926 calendar for the Be Smart Tailors of Madison Avenue, flashed goodwill from his paper monocle.

I picked the Twins to finish sixth in the seven-team American League West before the 1987 season started. And then, in the same Star Tribune preview section, I outlined a scenario in which they could turn their 71-91 record into 91-71.\n\nIt didn't happen. The Twins won only 85 games, the ninth best record in the majors that year. But it was good enough to win the division title -- and then all kinds of magic happened on the way to the Twins winning the World Series.\n\nWith the Twins in first place right now, it felt like the right time to track down what I wrote back then. See if you can find some parallels between what happened then and what may be happening now. Is Torii Hunter the Dan Gladden of 1987, for example?\n\nFor those of you old enough to remember, enjoy. For those of you who aren't, enjoy.\n\nJust like 1987, the Twins are in a position that we couldn't have expected. So enjoy it.\n\nThe Twins must regain respect in the front office and on the field.\n\nThat's what 1987 should be about.\n\nThe Twins are one of only two teams not to have a winning season\n\nin the 1980s. Seattle is the other and the Twins would be wise not to\n\ninvite further comparisons.\n\nSome may question whether owner Carl Pohlad's act of making sure\n\nthe Twins stayed in Minnesota was worth the fuss if things don't\n\nchange. The question: Is bad baseball better than no baseball? The\n\nanswer: Yes, but . . .\n\nAt least the Twins have recognized there's work to be done. The\n\nrevamped front office acquired premier reliever Jeff Reardon and\n\nentrusted, despite internal bickering, the managerial job to Tom Kelly.\n\nBoth seem to be sound moves. Kelly's training camp seemed to instill a\n\nwork ethic that disappeared in the aftermath of the final-weekend fold\n\nof 1984.\n\nBarring the extraordinary, the Twins will not finish 20 games\n\nbelow .500, as they did last year. But it's unrealistic to project the\n\nAmerican League pennant fluttering atop the Metrodome come October.\n\nGood things usually take time and a title isn't necessary for the Twins\n\nto win respect.\n\nIn these optimistic days when all 26 teams are undefeated, it's\n\nexpected to paint a scenario of success. If everything goes right, one\n\ncan imagine a Twins team that on Oct. 5, 1987, will have this notation\n\nin the standings:\n\nW L Pct. GB\n\nMinnesota 91 71 .562 . . .\n\nFrom 20 games under .500 to 20 games above. It would be the Twins' best\n\nrecord since the 1970 division champions won 98. That sort of dramatic\n\nshift wouldn't be unprecedented. The 1962 Twins improved by 21 games\n\nfrom the previous season and the 1965 pennant winners went from 79-83\n\nto 102-60. There also was an 18-game improvement between 1968 and the\n\nAL West winners of 1969.\n\nSo, it can be done. Here are the parts that can contribute to the\n\nsum:\n\nThe Reardon factor\/ Reardon had 35 saves for the Montreal Expos,\n\n70 percent of their total last season. The entire Twins staff had only\n\n24 saves. What if Reardon has 35 saves and the rest of Minnesota's\n\nstaff has 15, duplicating Montreal's numbers? That's 26 more saves than\n\n1986 and, irony of ironies, equals the number of games the Twins lost\n\nlast year when they were leading or tied going into the seventh inning.\n\nMore conservatively, let's say that Reardon accounts for a\n\ntwo-game swing for each member of the five-man starting rotation.\n\nInstead of 17-14, Bert Blyleven goes 19-12. Frank Viola goes from 16-13\n\nto 18-11. That's worth 10 games overall. That's a start.\n\nKeep it in perspective, though, because Reardon saved 76 games in\n\nthe 1985-86 seasons and his team was only three games above .500. He\n\ncan't do it alone.\n\nThe rotation\/ If Blyleven and Viola maintain their performance\n\nlevels and benefit from Reardon, they will threaten the 20-game\n\nplateau. If Mike Smithson rebounds from a poor 1986 and Mark Portugal\n\nfulfills his promise, they will be better than .500 pitchers. The fifth\n\nstarter, Les Straker for now, would be hard-pressed to struggle as\n\nbadly as the collection used in that role last year. Chalk up another\n\nhandful of games for that improvement.\n\nThe youth movement\/ Shortstop Greg Gagne and second baseman Steve\n\nLombardozzi played together full-time for the first time last year and\n\nestablished themselves as a double-play combination that bears\n\nwatching. The Twins turned double plays about which they could only\n\ndream in previous years and the duo should improve.\n\nGagne needs to reduce his errors (only Shawon Dunston of the Cubs\n\nmade more than Gagne's 26 at their position) and Lombardozzi needs to\n\ncontinue the play that allowed him to lead AL second basemen in\n\nfielding percentage. Both need to become better hitters, especially\n\nLombardozzi.\n\nOutfielder Mark Davidson made the team mostly because of his\n\ndefensive skills, but he can't afford to be an automatic out. His hot\n\nbat during spring training was a promising sign; his .118 average in 68\n\nat-bats last year wasn't. Rookie pitchers Straker and Joe Klink need to\n\nshow their exhibition work was no fluke.\n\nImprovement by those players won't account for more victories as\n\nmuch as they'll keep the Twins from losing a few more games.\n\nCareer years\/ Unexpected things must happen for title contention\n\nto be a reality. Maybe Tim Laudner, for example, really will establish\n\nhimself as the No. 1 catcher with ample power and defense. Maybe Viola\n\nwill win the 25 games that have been predicted by some. Maybe Gagne\n\nwill hit .280 and steal 25 bases. Maybe Kirby Puckett will win the\n\nTriple Crown.\n\nAt the same time, others must perform as in the past. Gary Gaetti\n\ncan't slump to 10 home runs and Puckett can't hit .260. Ponder for a\n\nmoment what would have happened had Gaetti's 1986 season (.287, 34\n\nhomers, 108 RBI) taken place in 1984 (.262, 5, 65), when the Twins\n\nfinished three games out of first place. Title, anyone?\n\nDepth\/ It must be better. Kelly must be able to look down his\n\nbench and find hitters when he needs them and defense when appropriate.\n\nIt's a simple enough premise, but one that has gone unfulfilled.\n\nToo often, the Twins have settled for all-around mediocrities to\n\nfill the bench while stronger teams stockpile players who can scare an\n\nopponent.\n\nA somewhat shocking statistical breakdown from last year:\n\nPinch hitters Avg. AB H HR RBI\n\nBush\/Al Woods .457 46 21 4 14\n\nOther Twins .188 149 28 0 17\n\nFine tuning\/ This is where the front office must be astute and\n\nsupportive. Getting Dan Gladden from San Francisco, a move that appears\n\nto fill needs for a speedy outfielder and leadoff batter, sent the\n\nright message to fans and players.\n\nShould the team emerge a contender, it will be imperative that\n\nexecutive vice president Andy MacPhail and personnel director Bob\n\nGebhard find players who can fill any needs that arise. That task is\n\neasier resolved than accomplished as the Pat Putnam\/Chris Speier\n\nacquisitions of three years ago will attest.\n\nMaybe we're getting ahead of ourselves by touching that topic, but\n\nthe AL West isn't exactly a terrifying collection.\n\nSummary\/ Most magazine prognosticators are looking for a\n\nsecond-division finish by the Twins. Yet who would have given the Red\n\nSox much chance going into last season or expected Texas to be a force?\n\nThe beginning of the season is too energizing a time to be\n\nconsumed by flaws that haven't been borne out on the field. No sense\n\nbeing a killjoy when 162 games remain with good seats available for\n\nmost of them, seats that will be filled if the Twins deserve the\n\nrecognition.\n\nIt is acceptable to be skeptical and should things go as poorly as\n\nin the past, it will be understandable to be ornery.\n\nA .500 season might not sound like much, but it would be 10 games\n\nbetter than 1986. More will be grounds for increments of excitement.","886":"Oncogenic human herpesvirus hijacks proline metabolism for tumorigenesis While understanding metabolic change of tumor cells is crucial to improve cancer therapy, current 2D cell culture condition may not fully recapitulate in vivo metabolic environment of tumors. Our metabolomics analysis demonstrates that proline metabolism is critical for the KSHV-transformed cell growth in 3D culture, not in 2D culture. Specifically, the KSHV K1 oncoprotein activates PYCR proline biosynthesis enzyme, increasing intracellular proline concentration for tumor cell growth in in vitro 3D spheroid culture and in vivo tumorigenesis. This study describes an oncogenic strategy of KSHV to enhance proline synthesis for virus-induced transformation, adding the proline metabolic pathway as a potential target for KS treatment.\n\nThree-dimensional (3D) cell culture is well documented to regain intrinsic metabolic properties and to better mimic the in vivo situation than two-dimensional (2D) cell culture. Particularly, proline metabolism is critical for tumorigenesis since pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) reductase (PYCR\/P5CR) is highly expressed in various tumors and its enzymatic activity is essential for in vitro 3D tumor cell growth and in vivo tumorigenesis. PYCR converts the P5C intermediate to proline as a biosynthesis pathway, whereas proline dehydrogenase (PRODH) breaks down proline to P5C as a degradation pathway. Intriguingly, expressions of proline biosynthesis PYCR gene and proline degradation PRODH gene are up-regulated directly by c-Myc oncoprotein and p53 tumor suppressor, respectively, suggesting that the proline-P5C metabolic axis is a key checkpoint for tumor cell growth. Here, we report a metabolic reprogramming of 3D tumor cell growth by oncogenic Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), an etiological agent of Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma. Metabolomic analyses revealed that KSHV infection increased nonessential amino acid metabolites, specifically proline, in 3D culture, not in 2D culture. Strikingly, the KSHV K1 oncoprotein interacted with and activated PYCR enzyme, increasing intracellular proline concentration. Consequently, the K1-PYCR interaction promoted tumor cell growth in 3D spheroid culture and tumorigenesis in nude mice. In contrast, depletion of PYCR expression markedly abrogated K1-induced tumor cell growth in 3D culture, not in 2D culture. This study demonstrates that an increase of proline biosynthesis induced by K1-PYCR interaction is critical for KSHV-mediated transformation in in vitro 3D culture condition and in vivo tumorigenesis.","887":"One dead in Parksville house fire VICTORIA -- A fatal house fire in Parksville claimed one life Monday morning.\n\nThe Parksville Fire Department was called to a house fire on Phillips Street at approximately 10 a.m.\n\nNeighbours tell CTV News Vancouver Island that they saw smoke coming from the home and tried to bang on the front door to see if anyone was inside.\n\nWitness also say they saw firefighters remove a man from the house.\n\nFire investigators are set to return to the home Tuesday morning to determine what started the fire.","888":"Opinion | Beating the Coronavirus Is the Best Stimulus Directing businesses to fight the pandemic would help workers more than an infrastructure splurge.\n\nThe ink had barely dried on the $2 trillion Covid-19 rescue package enacted March 27 when congressional Democrats and Republicans, along with President Trump, hinted that it wouldn't be enough.

This virus is its own animal -- it's totally different in so many ways. As a physician, so much of what I've learned to treat over the years does not apply. Throw conventional wisdom out the window.\n\nThought we treated sepsis with fluids? Think again.\n\nThought we treated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations with steroids? Think again.\n\nThought we ventilated people with pneumonia on their backs? Think again.\n\nThink we knew much about anything?\n\nI showed up ready to serve, like thousands of my colleagues and health care workers across the globe. This is totally different.\n\nSecond, most in the health care profession don't whine. They just do it. I've never seen anything like it before. Doctors, nurses, aids, clerks, janitorial staff: They show up every day. They are apolitical. They believe in humanity, however imperfect.\n\nThird, there is hope in all adversity. We have to listen for the truths buried within the struggle. It may be transformative. No one can do this for us.\n\nFourth, I have some guarded hope for treatment. This virus is nasty. I'm the first to admit that I did not \"get it.\" Now I do. All of the practitioners on the front lines see how bad it can be. I won't quote outcomes, but we're gathering data as we go. There will be more studies published over the next few months than can be digested in a lifetime. I don't claim to be any authority. Most of us only have observational, nonscientific analysis, but I had some positive results. Yes, I think I did.\n\nI ran a floor of COVID-19 positive patients with severe symptoms. Our team used the combo of hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin and it seemed to help! Of the patients that I treated for these four days who where acutely ill -- all ages and health conditions -- most (loosely defined and footnoted) seemed to improve and were able to be discharged home. I can say that I transferred no one to the ICU but I sent many people home.\n\nProgress? I sure hope so. Would they have responded without?

While effective in select cancers, their clinical utility remains limited by intrinsic or acquired resistance. This is attributed, in part, to poor drug tumor localization and uptake. Additionally, one of the more formidable mechanisms of platinum resistance involves dysfunction of the tumor suppressor p53. Lack of wild-type p53 activation can translate to a significant reduction in the 5-y survival rate compared with mutant p53 in some cancers. The inability to overcome p53 dysfunction in concert with the dose-limiting toxicities and poor tumor-specific drug delivery of Pt provides an incentive to develop agents as described in this report.\n\nDescribed here is the development of gadolinium(III) texaphyrin-platinum(IV) conjugates capable of overcoming platinum resistance by 1) localizing to solid tumors, 2) promoting enhanced cancer cell uptake, and 3) reactivating p53 in platinum-resistant models. Side by side comparative studies of these Pt(IV) conjugates to clinically approved platinum(II) agents and previously reported platinum(II)-texaphyrin conjugates demonstrate that the present Pt(IV) conjugates are more stable against hydrolysis and nucleophilic attack. Moreover, they display high potent antiproliferative activity in vitro against human and mouse cell cancer lines. Relative to the current platinum clinical standard of care (SOC), a lead Gd(III) texaphyrin-Pt(IV) prodrug conjugate emerging from this development effort was found to be more efficacious in subcutaneous (s.c.) mouse models involving both cell-derived xenografts and platinum-resistant patient-derived xenografts. Comparative pathology studies in mice treated with equimolar doses of the lead Gd texaphyrin-Pt(IV) conjugate or the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agent oxaliplatin revealed that the conjugate was better tolerated. Specifically, the lead could be dosed at more than three times (i.e., 70 mg\/kg per dose) the tolerable dose of oxaliplatin (i.e., 4 to 6 mg\/kg per dose depending on the animal model) with little to no observable adverse effects. A combination of tumor localization, redox cycling, and reversible protein binding is invoked to explain the relatively increased tolerability and enhanced anticancer activity seen in vivo. On the basis of the present studies, we conclude that metallotexaphyrin-Pt conjugates may have substantial clinical potential as antitumor agents.","902":"PCB CEO Slams Mohammad Hafeez For Questioning Tainted Sharjeel Khan's Comeback | Cricket News The Pakistan Cricket Board has reprimanded Mohammad Hafeez for questioning the tainted Sharjeel Khan's return to the game, saying the senior all-rounder should be \"focusing on his own game\" instead of criticising fellow players or making comments on the PCB's policies.

Here, we characterize a protein found on the surface of mosquito stages of malaria parasites and reveal that it serves to evade the mosquito immune system and ensure disease transmission. Neutralization of PIMMS43 (Plasmodium Infection of the Mosquito Midgut Screen 43), either by eliminating it from the parasite genome or by preincubating parasites with antibodies that bind to the PIMMS43 protein, inhibits mosquito infection with malaria parasites. Differences in PIMMS43 detected between African malaria parasite populations suggest that these populations have adapted for transmission by different mosquito vectors that are also differentially distributed across the continent. We conclude that targeting PIMMS43 can block malaria parasites inside mosquitoes before they can infect humans.\n\nAfter being ingested by a female Anopheles mosquito during a bloodmeal on an infected host, and before they can reach the mosquito salivary glands to be transmitted to a new host, Plasmodium parasites must establish an infection of the mosquito midgut in the form of oocysts. To achieve this, they must first survive a series of robust innate immune responses that take place prior to, during, and immediately after ookinete traversal of the midgut epithelium. Understanding how parasites may evade these responses could highlight new ways to block malaria transmission. We show that an ookinete and sporozoite surface protein designated as PIMMS43 (Plasmodium Infection of the Mosquito Midgut Screen 43) is required for parasite evasion of the Anopheles coluzzii complement-like response. Disruption of PIMMS43 in the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium berghei triggers robust complement activation and ookinete elimination upon mosquito midgut traversal. Silencing components of the complement-like system through RNAi largely restores ookinete-to-oocyst transition but oocysts remain small in size and produce a very small number of sporozoites that additionally are not infectious, indicating that PIMMS43 is also essential for sporogonic development in the oocyst. Antibodies that bind PIMMS43 interfere with parasite immune evasion when ingested with the infectious blood meal and significantly reduce the prevalence and intensity of infection. PIMMS43 genetic structure across African Plasmodium falciparum populations indicates allelic adaptation to sympatric vector populations. These data add to our understanding of mosquito-parasite interactions and identify PIMMS43 as a target of malaria transmission blocking.","905":"PSL 2020 Postponed Due To Coronavirus Pandemic | Cricket News The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Tuesday postponed the remainder of its premier T20 event -- the Pakistan Super League -- amid the global COVID-19 pandemic.

The dorsal striatum regulates movement and cognition, whereas the ventral striatum modulates reward and emotion. The importance of striatal divisions also is reflected in neurological diseases as the dorsal and ventral striata are differentially targeted by Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and drug addiction disorders. Despite the significance of these neurological differences, the neural mechanisms underlying the division of the striatum into the dorsal and ventral districts remain elusive. Here, we have identified two key genes Nolz-1 and Dlx1\/2, and the interactions between Nolz-1 and Dlx1\/2 genes are critical for the developmental processes by which the striatum is divided into dorsal and ventral districts.\n\nThe striatal complex of basal ganglia comprises two functionally distinct districts. The dorsal district controls motor and cognitive functions. The ventral district regulates the limbic function of motivation, reward, and emotion. The dorsoventral parcellation of the striatum also is of clinical importance as differential striatal pathophysiologies occur in Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and drug addiction disorders. Despite these striking neurobiologic contrasts, it is largely unknown how the dorsal and ventral divisions of the striatum are set up. Here, we demonstrate that interactions between the two key transcription factors Nolz-1 and Dlx1\/2 control the migratory paths of striatal neurons to the dorsal or ventral striatum. Moreover, these same transcription factors control the cell identity of striatal projection neurons in both the dorsal and the ventral striata including the D1-direct and D2-indirect pathways. We show that Nolz-1, through the I12b enhancer, represses Dlx1\/2, allowing normal migration of striatal neurons to dorsal and ventral locations. We demonstrate that deletion, up-regulation, and down-regulation of Nolz-1 and Dlx1\/2 can produce a striatal phenotype characterized by a withered dorsal striatum and an enlarged ventral striatum and that we can rescue this phenotype by manipulating the interactions between Nolz-1 and Dlx1\/2 transcription factors. Our study indicates that the two-tier system of striatal complex is built by coupling of cell-type identity and migration and suggests that the fundamental basis for divisions of the striatum known to be differentially vulnerable at maturity is already encoded by the time embryonic striatal neurons begin their migrations into developing striata.","908":"Parenting in Ethiopia: lessons on raising children under tough conditions The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations\n\nInvestments made in early childhood last a lifetime, and the earlier in life, the greater the return, according to James Heckman who was awarded a Nobel Prize for economics.

For example, children who were young at the time of the 1984 famine in Ethiopia are 5cm shorter at adulthood, have lower education and are more likely to have recently been ill.\n\nWhen assessing long-term effects of early life circumstances, it's difficult to disentangle biological from social processes. An outstanding question is: why can't children catch up after shocks to their development?\n\nIt's hard to know whether those in Ethiopia in 1984 were permanently affected by the famine because there are biological processes at work which prevent them catching up, or because their parents stopped investing in them in favour of their siblings who were better off. In other words, do parents reinforce differences, or do they try to compensate for them?\n\nTo answer this question, we conducted a study to examine how parents in a very resource-constrained setting responded to differences in their children's ability. We used data from the Young Lives cohort study in Ethiopia, which is a study of childhood poverty following children born at the turn of the millennium as they grow up.\n\nThe children's ability was measured by how they scored on a vocabulary test. We assessed around 1 400 children aged between 5 and 8 years old. They were all pairs of two siblings. We took the difference between these test scores and examined the relationship between these and differences in spending on education for each child.\n\nWe found that parents tended to invest more in the child who has worse cognitive achievement and used their scarce resources to spend more on education. Even in a sample of extremely poor households, those who comparably had more resources were most likely to compensate for differences in ability. These differences are significant but marginal in value.\n\nWhen following up the children three years later, we found no change in the gap between the siblings, despite parent's efforts. This indicates that the achievement gap for those children who suffer from severe early life conditions is due to biological processes, even though their parents try to help them catch up.\n\nThe research\n\nThere is a possibility that differences in test scores were already caused by parents investing differently in each child up to the point that they took the test, which is a common problem in studies of this type. To deal with this problem, we attempted to isolate those differences in cognitive development that were caused by factors outside of the household's control.\n\nFor this, we used the difference in rainfall levels during early childhood of the two siblings. In Ethiopia, rainfall is highly correlated with income and poorer parent's ability to invest.\n\nWe see this as evidence of how poor households are trying to improve the life chances of all their children, and even a small improvement in their wealth leads to greater efforts to compensate for adverse shocks. But these efforts were not successful. We think this is due to the small resources at their disposal. The importance of interventions at the earliest stages of life also cannot be emphasised enough.\n\nCompeting theories\n\nAs part of our research, we explored existing economic theories about how parents allocate their scarce resources in the household. There are two competing ones.\n\nMany economists subscribe to the idea that a family that wants to maximise the total income of all children should invest in the highest ability child, or reinforce differences (the so-called efficiency argument). So, other things being equal, if you have a sibling who is smarter than you, your parents will invest in them more than in you.\n\nHowever, a competing theory is that parents are averse to inequality between their children, and would rather compensate for any differences. In developed countries, income is higher and the government plays a stronger role: schooling is compulsory, public education is free, and legislation prohibiting children from working full time is strongly enforced.\n\nIn developing countries, many poor parents face even tighter financial constraints, and the prevalence of child labour means there are starker trade-offs: invest in your child now to ensure a brighter, more prosperous future? Or, have them use their time to work in order to feed the family today? It's often assumed that in the poorest countries, the constraints will outweigh the desire for equality, and therefore parents will reinforce differences.\n\nGoing forward\n\nEthiopia's economy has been growing rapidly in the past ten years, and an expanded social safety net. But many households are still very poor and dependent on rain-fed agriculture. Malnutrition rates are high, and expansion in access to education has not translated into improved learning outcomes.\n\nProtecting children from adverse events in early childhood will become even more important as Africa will face the consequences of climate change. Governments need to do more to support parents in what are expected to become increasingly tough conditions. This includes social additional social protection measures. And it should include interventions like rainfall insurance and climate change adaptation to help parents do the best for their children.","909":"Passover recipe: Wise Sons Deli's Brisket By Jessica Yadegaran | jyadegaran@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group\n\nSoda. Onion soup mix. Chili sauce. Sorry, Bubbe, but this year you won't need a single sugar or MSG-loaded ingredient to make Passover brisket. Instead, gather spicy brown deli mustard, prunes, carrots, onions and dry red wine for Wise Sons Deli's epic version.\n\nMake sure you start with a good flat cut of meat with an even thickness and 1-inch fat cap to ensure tenderness while braising, says Wise Sons' Evan Bloom. You'll find the recipe in his new cookbook, \"Eat Something\" (Chronicle Books, $30), co-written by Rachel Levin.\n\n1\/3 cup spicy brown deli mustard (any mustard will work in a pinch), plus more as needed\n\n3 cups homemade stock, low-sodium chicken, beef, or vegetable broth, or water\n\n12-ounce bottle of beer (something dark and sweet, like a porter) or \u00bd bottle dry red wine (such as cabernet or zinfandel)\n\n8 garlic cloves, peeled and smashed with the flat side of a knife\n\nIn a small bowl, mix the mustard, salt, and pepper. Slather all over the brisket and place it on a baking sheet. Let sit, uncovered, in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours or overnight for maximum moistness.\n\nHeat the oven to 350 degrees.\n\nHeat the oil in a Dutch oven or other large heavy-bottomed, ovenproof pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add the brisket and sear until browned on both sides, 5 to 8 minutes per side. You want a nice golden crust. Transfer to a platter and set aside.\n\nIncrease the heat to medium-high, add the stock to the pot and bring to a simmer, scraping up the browned bits from the bottom. Add the beer, prunes, bay leaves and brown sugar. Cook until the sugar has dissolved, stirring if necessary. Remove from the heat.\n\nReturn the brisket to the pot, fat-side up, and scatter the carrots around the meat. Blanket the meat with the onions and garlic. Cover the pot tightly with a lid or heavy-duty aluminum foil. Transfer to the oven and braise the brisket for about 3 hours, flipping the brisket every hour. Cook until a fork inserted into the center rotates easily, with just a little resistance, but without tearing the meat to shreds.\n\nRemove the brisket from the pot and use a large, sharp knife to cut the brisket against the grain into \u00bc inch-thick slices. Remove the bay leaves from the pot and discard.\n\nUsing an immersion blender directly in the pot, pur\u00e9e the jus and the remaining tender vegetables -- this will give the gravy a sweet taste and enough body to slick over the brisket.\n\nAt this point, the brisket and gravy can be transferred to a roasting pan, ready to reheat, with the brisket fanned out and smothered by the gravy. (Or store in separate containers.) Let cool, then cover and refrigerate overnight.\n\nTo serve, heat the oven to 300 degrees. Use a spoon to skim off any fat on the surface of the gravy. Cover tightly with heavy-duty aluminum foil and warm for about 30 minutes, or until heated through.\n\nNote: In the deli, we like a thicker gravy. To achieve this, transfer half of it to a small heavy-bottomed pot and bring to a medium simmer. (Meanwhile, keep the sliced brisket and remaining gravy warm on the lowest setting.) Cook the gravy in the small pot until reduced by half, 30 to 40 minutes, stirring as needed so it doesn't burn. If you like, whisk in the butter for extra sheen, body, and richness, and add a bit more mustard to taste. Transfer the brisket to a platter, spoon the thickened gravy over the meat and serve.","910":"Patrick Reusse on Sid Hartman: The birthday boy is awesome (literally) I nteractions with Sid Hartman have caused people to be annoyed, alarmed, amused, afraid, agonized, alienated and accepting, and those are just the \"a'' reactions that I recall from my first night at work in late August 1963, as a copy boy in the Minneapolis Morning Tribune's sports department. We are now more than 56 years removed from that first encounter with Mr. Hartman, and the reaction that overwhelms all those others is this: awe.\n\nThanks to the wacky calendar of ancient Rome, as well as William Shakespeare, March 15 is known across the globe as the \"Ides of March,\" the day that Julius Caesar met his demise.\n\nThere is a geographical exception to this: Minnesota, where March 15 is less the occasion of Caesar's death than Sid Hartman's birth.\n\nI'd put it at 1995 when this date officially became \"Sid's Birthday\" within our borders. That's the first occasion that I was moved to write about it, anyway ... Sid turning 75.\n\nI had traveled to Baseball City in Florida to see Gene Mauch, who had signed on as Kansas City's bench coach for rookie manager Bob Boone. I received the traditional greeting from Mauch: \"How's Sid doing?\"\n\nIt should be noted that the piece celebrating Sid's 75th was being written at a point when Sid was determined to acknowledge only the birthday, not the number.\n\nThat's why there was this passage in the column of March 15, 1995:\n\n\" ... there is reason to believe this birthday is a sparkling landmark near the midpoint of Sid's golden journey from 50 to the century mark.\"\n\nThat was intended to be witty, not a prediction.\n\nAnd that century mark -- Sid made it, sliding up to 100 by producing three or four columns per week (with the loyal work of Jeff Day as his right-hand man) for the Star Tribune.\n\nThere is also the radio job for the Big Neighbor, and still highlighted by a guest-filled Sunday morning show that remains the bane of existence for P.R. and communications directors with our major pro sports teams and the Gophers.\n\nI was walking in the press box level of Hammond Stadium in mid-February. Dustin Morse, the Twins' media maestro, was in his office with the door open.\n\n\"I'll do my best,\" he was saying into a phone. \"We're just getting started with workouts. I'll do my best.\"\n\nI looked around the corner and asked quietly: \"Sid?\" Dustin nodded and lightly shook his head.\n\nSome people refuse to take \"no\" for an answer. When Sid's hunting radio guests for Sunday, he won't take \"I'll do my best\" for an answer.\n\nSid wants guarantees -- preferably notarized.\n\nNobody in the long history of Sid's Sunday radio show listened with more apprehension than Tim McGuire, who spent two decades dealing with Hartman as managing editor and then executive editor at the Star Tribune.\n\nWhen Sid's ardor for supporting team owners or the Gophers went way over the top (key word \"way\"), it was McGuire who would summon him to the office and demand restraint.\n\n\"Invariably, that would lead Sid to go on the Sunday radio show and say, 'McGuire's going to be mad at me for saying this, but ...'\u2009\" McGuire said last week. \"It was bad enough that he was ignoring what I told him; he would announce to his sizable audience he was ignoring it.\"\n\nMcGuire laughed and said: \"There are few people that I got angrier with than Sid, and no one who has been kinder to my family and me than Sid. What I'm wearing right now is a cross he gave to me, and it says, 'With all my love, Sid.'\u2009\"\n\nTo me, nobody in the ever-expanding Twin Cities sports market has dealt with Sid in finer fashion than Bob Hagan, nearing his 30th year working with the media for the Vikings.\n\nHagan is a loyal friend to Sid, rather than a \"close personal friend.\" Makes sure to get him to lunch regularly. And Hagan walks that fine line of treating Sid with full respect while also applying the \"needle,\" now endangered but long a grand part of inner-sports.\n\nBest prank ever: Sid takes a fall on ice and breaks a hip in mid-December 2016. Curtains for most 96-year-olds, an inconvenience for Sid.\n\nTwo days later, the Vikings play the stinker of the first season in the ZygiDome, losing 34-6 to the Indianapolis Colts. Two days after that, Sid's out of danger and Hagan shows up at Fairview Southdale with a football signed by many Vikings.\n\n\"This is the game ball from Sunday's Colts game,\" Hagan says. \"The players wanted you to have it.\"\n\nHartman had been through Hades for four days, but he remained sharp enough to throw profanities at Hagan, and more of those while bad-mouthing the players for their lousy effort.\n\nHearing has been a problem for Sid for years, but he retains the vision of a hawk. This ability to observe allowed Sid to attach apropos nicknames to people, thus permitting him to not remember names.\n\nThere was Mr. Shirts, Mr. Page One, Mr. Mortuary, George Halas Jr., nicknames all the way down to the guy who collected Vikings' urine samples for drug testing at Winter Park being called \"Mr. ...\"\n\nIn the days of a confined newsroom at the Star Tribune, we had a young woman on the support staff with an attendance problem. There were several workers in this group, and Sid would breeze past the area in which they resided on the way to his office.\n\nOne late afternoon Sid stopped abruptly in front of her and said: \"Nice you could make it, Cal Ripken Jr.\"\n\nI've been around forever, and Sid has been around this long:\n\nHe started as a sportswriter in 1944 when siding with the home team was basically required, and he fought the \"negative geniuses\" through the decades when neutrality was the sword on which most of us fell, and now in this world of massive sports media and outlets fighting to be the leading supporters of home teams, Sid's still at the front of the pack.\n\nMr. Hartman is an old dog who hasn't had to learn new tricks. He helped invent those tricks.\n\nWrite to Patrick Reusse by e-mailing sports@startribune.com and including his name in the subject line.","911":"Peeing during sex? You're not alone. Here's what to do about it Louise Court investigates why talking about sex and bladder weakness is still strictly off-limits for many British women - and why this needs to change\n\nLousie Court\n\nFri 27 Mar 2020 15.17 GMT Last modified on Fri 27 Mar 2020 17.39 GMT\n\nAdmittedly, it's not the most romantic sweet nothing to whisper into your partner's ear.\n\nThe erotic murmuring, \"Sorry darling, I may pee slightly during sex\" is not one of the most orthodox of come-on lines - but, bearing in mind the number of women who suffer from incontinence, maybe it should be.\n\nSo it's no surprise that many women fear that casually mentioning a touch of stress incontinence during foreplay will add a dampener to the occasion.\n\nWith one in three women battling bladder weakness, many of them choose to say nothing ... to anybody - not their friends, doctors or sexual partners. Some prefer to avoid sex altogether.\n\nResearch of women aged 30 to 70 has shown that women with incontinence issues were not only more likely not to have sex, but they also had less desire and satisfaction than women without the problem.\n\nWhile it is socially more acceptable for women to giggle about the perils of dodgy bladder control when exercising, sneezing and coughing, they really don't share surreptitious giggles about the fear of stress incontinence in the bedroom.\n\nBut, according to relationship and sex therapist Rachel Morris, not talking about it is the biggest problem of all.\n\n\"A lot of young women avoid talking about it because they think it's an old woman's problem, but there are lots of different causes. Women don't want other people to think they are weird, but the statistics show that one in three women suffer. Not just one in three women over 40.\n\n\"It could be a short-term problem associated with an infection. It's not just caused by childbirth and the menopause. Some women simply don't have good pelvic floor muscles. Sometimes there are things you can do about it, but you don't know until you tell someone.\"\n\nThe first stop, Morris says, is always to talk to your GP, who will tell you if it is an infection that can be sorted out with a course of antibiotics. Alternatively, it could be due to a reduction in oestrogen because of something like the menopause, when hormone replacement therapy or oestrogen pellets could be prescribed.\n\n\"Your GP could help, so you don't even need to talk to your partner. The trouble is if you are avoiding sex because you are scared of incontinence and you don't do anything about it. If that includes not talking to your partner, they are quite likely to imagine it is them you are avoiding, not the sex. Which creates a whole different problem in your relationship.\"\n\nHowever, choosing the time and the place to tell all is never easy.\n\n\"Ideally, don't have the conversation in bed when you are both naked and feeling vulnerable, when sex is about to take place or just has. I am a therapist and I understand how difficult it often is for people to say things out loud. It is easier to say something when you are side by side and not looking at each other, when you are going for walk, for example, and you are not likely to be interrupted.\"\n\nMorris has other practical advice too, from finding the right sex positions (spooning - lying side by side - is better than acrobatic moves where gravity will not be your friend) to changing your drinking habits.\n\n\"If you know you are going to be having sex, don't drink anything for a while before, especially drinks with a high sugar content or caffeine, which can act as diuretics and make you want to wee,\" she explains. \"Restrict yourself to just sipping water in the hour or so before.\"\n\nOne woman would only have sex when she and her husband had both been drinking heavily, hoping he wouldn't notice, and if he did she could blame it on being drunk. Not a great basis for a happy love life.\n\n\"Empty your bladder before sex, and when you think you are empty try to go again. It may be unromantic, but you can also always get up for a quick wee after foreplay,\" says Morris. \"A lot of women want to go to the loo after they orgasm. You can explain to your partner in a flattering way that sometimes when you are really excited your body really lets go and that may include some wee. You can say: 'I just want to check that doesn't freak you out.' They may take it as a compliment.\"\n\nIt should obviously be easier to have the conversation with someone you are in a long-term relationship with, but what you have to remember is it is a common biological fact and isn't anything to be embarrassed about.\n\n\"Stress incontinence happens if your pelvic floor muscles are weak. You can improve them with kegel exercises - squeezing and releasing your vaginal muscles when you urinate or are having sex.\n\n\"The trouble with women not talking about the problem with each other, as well as their partners, is that they don't know how normal and very ordinary it is,\" says Morris. \"People are squeamish, but, when I lived in Paris, they regarded such stuff as ordinary, healthy conversations.\"\n\nAs incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

We all have that friend on Facebook who enthusiastically posts about their gym activities, weight loss and jogs before dawn.\n\nIt may even be that you are that friend.\n\nAnd while it can be motivating, inspiring even, to read about the latest workout, studies have shown that people who habitually post about their exercise, diets and accomplishments are more likely to be narcissists.\n\nA recent study by Brunel University London found that:\n\nNarcissists more frequently updated about their achievements, which was motivated by their need for attention and validation from the Facebook community.\n\nThe research found that updates about fitness and workouts were more likely to be 'liked' and shared than other kinds of social media posts.\n\nHowever, the study noted, this may not necessarily mean that other users are impressed.\n\nLead author Dr Tara Marshal said:\n\nAlthough our results suggest that narcissists' bragging pays off because they receive more likes and comments to their status updates, it could be that Facebook friends politely offer support while secretly disliking such egotistical displays.\n\nThe research also found that people who post multiple statuses about their girlfriend or boyfriend are more likely to have low self-esteem, while people who mostly post about their children are more likely to be conscientious.\n\nFor those anxious to be less insufferable on social media, Dr Marshall offers some general advice:\n\nGreater awareness of how one's status updates might be perceived by friends could help people to avoid topics that annoy more than they entertain.\n\nThe study was based on surveys from 555 Facebook users and was published in the journal Personality and Individual Differences.","913":"PharmaCielo Ltd.

Who would be better to document the developments at the epicenter of the action than someone who is already involved with the National Guard? Master Sergeant Matt Hecht is a visual storyteller for the New Jersey National Guard. Having joined the U.S. Air Force in 2011, after four years on active duty, Hecht decided to continue his career in the Air National Guard. The appeal was that the Guard allowed Hecht to continue his service but also to homestead in the state he is originally from. In 2015 he was hired to work at the joint Army and Air Guard Public Affairs Office.\n\nNew Jersey National Guard Airmen watch a demonstration of procedures at a COVID-19 Community-Based Testing Site at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J.\n\nAs the pandemic first appeared, Hecht was concerned, but the situation felt like something remote. What caught his attention was the viciousness of how the virus spread. Soon, as the first cases appeared in the U.S., Hecht knew National Guard would get involved. Although citizens are generally used to hearing about combat deployments, the National Guard is now doing exactly what they are supposed to, namely, assisting communities in crises. Hecht is a part of a small group that works full-time for the Guard, alongside the assistance provided by citizen soldiers such as the medics, truck drivers, and military police who are supporting the New Jersey Office of Emergency Management and Department of Health.\n\nAfter experiencing risky situations during his deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan, Hecht points out that those situations had quantifiable dangers. This time, however, they have been faced with an invisible threat and many unknowns. The team that Hecht is a part of has been split up for several weeks now, so not having the face-to-face interactions has been challenging in this line of work. Only himself and one other military photographer have got together for jobs, while the two civilians in their office have been teleworking.\n\nMedical staff collect samples from a patient at a COVID-19 Community-Based Testing Site at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J.\n\nDuring jobs, Hecht receives masks, while medics and nurses had higher levels of protection to directly interact with patients. Afterward, all of his camera equipment gets wiped down to decrease any risk of infection, with uniforms going straight in the wash.\n\nWith the obvious danger and risk to Hecht's physical health, the jobs have also been mentally draining. Working at the COVID-19 drive-thru site in Paramu, Hecht had not seen so many sick people all in one place. The biggest challenge arises when a photographer has to consider the privacy and comfort of patients while also recording crucial images that depict the reality of the situation. Hecht points out that doing so not only gives taxpayers a transparent view of what their military is doing but also helps record history. The images that are captured are public domain and will eventually be in the Library of Congress.\n\nMedical staff collect samples from a patient at a COVID-19 Community-Based Testing Site at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J.\n\nHecht had no expectations of what he was going to be faced with, whether the images would depict anxiety or fear, but when he showed some of his messages to friends, their first response was \"hope.\"","916":"Photography Marketing Plan for the Recession | Fstoppers Hard times ahead?

Developmental arrest, called diapause, occurs at a species-specific developmental stage, and embryonic and pupal diapauses have been extensively studied in mostly holometabolous insects. Some other insects overwinter in the nymphal stage with slow growth for which the mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show that this nymphal period of slow growth is regulated by temperature and photoperiod through separate pathways in the cricket Modicogryllus siamensis. The former regulates the growth rate, at least in part, through the insulin \/ target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway. Lower temperature down-regulates the expression of insulin-like peptide (Ms'Ilp) and Target of rapamycin (Ms'Tor) genes to slow down the growth rate without affecting the number of molts. The latter regulates the number of molts independent of temperature. Short days increase the number of molts through activation of the juvenile hormone (JH) pathway and down-regulation of myoglianin (Ms'myo), a member of the TGF\u03b2 family, which induces adult metamorphosis. In contrast, long days regulate Ms'myo expression to increase during the fifth to sixth instar to initiate adult metamorphosis. When Ms'myo expression is suppressed, juvenile hormone O-methyl transferase (Ms'jhamt) was up-regulated and increased molts to prolong the nymphal period even under long-day conditions. The present findings suggested that the photoperiod regulated Ms'myo, and the JH signaling pathway and the temperature-controlled insulin\/TOR pathway cooperated to regulate nymphal development for overwintering to achieve seasonal adaptation of the life cycle in M. siamensis.","918":"Piers Morgan erupts at Boris Johnson critics as he battles in ICU: 'Shut the f*** up!'

Many of the properties of glasses are universal -- i.e., independent of their composition and the liquid-phase temperature from which they were cooled. One such property is the existence of noncrystalline soft vibrational excitations, which are highly localized in space and follow a universal vibrational frequency distribution, with a nonuniversal coefficient. We show that pinching glasses -- i.e., applying local force perturbations to them -- reveals dramatic variability in the physics of this coefficient with . In particular, it reveals how the number of noncrystalline soft vibrational excitations, their size, and typical degree of softness vary with , having major implications for the behavior of glasses in a wide variety of situations.","920":"Pittsburg man arrested after father is fatally shot PITTSBURG, Kan.

A possible merger with the county system has come up repeatedly over the years, but concerns about losing the library building and its small-town feel stalled talks.\n\nCity officials said the building needs upgrades, including a new roof and mechanical systems. Library staffers said it lacks the room and amenities of modern libraries.\n\nThe city's proposal should spur further discussion with the County Board, several City Council members said.\n\n\"Since I've started here the issue has been, 'What are we going to do with the library?'\u2009\" said Mayor Jimmy Francis. \"This is a wonderful opportunity to see what could be.\"\n\nDakota County officials said they couldn't comment on the proposal until they receive it from the city.\n\nThe first option would reuse the current library and expand it onto the site of the Lawshe Museum next door, but only if the museum moves. The museum is home base for the Dakota County Historical Society.\n\nThe second choice is to build a new library at 7th and Marie avenues on land owned by the city and the South St. Paul school district. It would require closing 7th Avenue.\n\nThe South St. Paul library has an annual operating budget of nearly $770,000. If Dakota County took over the library, the city would save about $320,000 in annual property taxes.\n\nSome residents, however, fear that a Dakota County takeover would mean losing autonomy and a sense of history. A residents group led by local historian Lois Glewwe wants the library to stay at its current site and under city management. She said it's a unique community asset that's regularly used by neighborhood kids and seniors.\n\nGlewwe said she's also upset that the proposal suggests the historical society might leave. She laments the lack of creative solutions by city and county officials, she said.\n\n\"It's like they just had made up their mind that they don't want the library anymore,\" she said, referring to City Council members.\n\nA recent city survey indicates that 61% of residents think the current library needs upgrades, 17% disagree and 23% are uncertain. When asked whether Dakota County should take over the library, 49% said yes, 35% said no and 16% said maybe.\n\nA starting point\n\nTalks about the library's future began several years ago. A 2016 study recommended building an addition and other upgrades to the existing library at a cost of $4.5 million.\n\nA year ago, city officials asked the county to study a merger, but county officials said no; they wanted to nail down plans for the building before making other decisions.\n\nKathy Halgren, director of the South St. Paul Library, said the city library has enjoyed its independence but that \"there's no question\" Dakota County has a great library system. Halgren, who said she sees the city's proposal as a starting point, added that she prefers the option of incorporating the old building into a new one.\n\nMatt Carter, who leads the Dakota County Historical Society, said the library's future is a \"hot-button issue\" in the community and that there are pros and cons to each option. He said he hasn't heard anything \"other than rumblings here or there\" that the Lawshe Museum might move. The museum also needs renovations, he said.","922":"Playoff spot up for grabs for Wild in matchup vs. Capitals The out-of-town scoreboard was an ally of the Wild's Saturday night, and now the team has a chance to move into a playoff spot for the first time since Dec.6 with a win Sunday against the Capitals at Xcel Energy Center.\n\n\"It would mean a lot,\" winger Zach Parise said. \"We got some help last night.

We investigate how melt of glacier ice transported and deposited by multiple j\u00f6kulhlaups during the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull, Iceland, modified the volume and surface elevation of j\u00f6kulhlaup deposits. J\u00f6kulhlaups generated by the eruption deposited large volumes of sediment and ice, causing significant geomorphic change in the G\u00edgj\u00f6kull proglacial basin over a 4-week period. Observation of these events enabled robust constraints on the physical properties of the floods which informs our understanding of the deposits. Using ground-based LiDAR, GPS observations and the satellite-image-derived ArcticDEMs, we quantify the post-depositional response of the 60 m-thick G\u00edgj\u00f6kull sediment package to the meltout of buried ice and other geomorphic processes. Between 2010 and 2016, total deposit volume reduced by -0.95 \u00d7 106 m3 a-1, with significant surface lowering of up to 1.88 m a-1. Surface lowering and volumetric loss of the deposits is attributed to three factors: (i) meltout of ice deposited by the j\u00f6kulhlaups; (ii) rapid melting of the buried G\u00edgj\u00f6kull glacier snout; and (iii) incision of the proglacial meltwater system into the j\u00f6kulhlaup deposits.","933":"Postgame: Baserunning mistake wasn't costly For a 70-win team, the Twins sure had a lot to talk about on Saturday. Here are some leftovers on the eve of the season finale:\n\nTWO BASERUNNING MISTAKES: The Twins scored a dozen runs and won easily, so Ron Gardenhire didn't get too upset about a baserunning mistake that cost the Twins at least one run on Saturday. In the sixth inning, after the Twins had already put six runs on the scoreboard, Chris Herrmann lined a single to center with runners on first and second. Oswaldo Arcia rounded third and headed for home, while Eduardo Escobar got to second and just kept going. The throw from Ezequiel Carrera was to third, and Escobar was tagged out to end the inning. Not only did Escobar violate baseball prudence -- never make the final out at third -- but Arcia's run didn't count because the out was recorded before he touched home plate. The manager was not happy.\n\n\"Arcia slowed up knowing they didn't have a play on him, and Esco's running in behind him. Esco probably needs to stay on second base, and Arcia needs to run hard all the way,\" Gardenhire said. \"We talked to them about it in the dugout. Luckily, we won the ballgame and you can joke around a little bit. But when those games are tight and everything's on the line, you've got to do better than that.\"\n\nSANTANA SCARE: The Twins got a scare in the seventh inning, when Danny Santana appeared to be injured on a play that was eerily similar to the one that resulted in a concussion to Justin Morneau four years ago. While taking a throw to record a force out at second base, Santana's right knee struck baserunner Kevin Romine's helmet as he slid into the base. Santana fell awkwardly, then laid on the ground for a couple of minutes, grabbing his knee. But he finally got up and walked around, then decided to stay in the game. \"It's uncomfortable for a little bit, but as soon as Dr. Arcia came in there and called him some names, he was fine,\" Gardenhire joked. Romine apparently was OK, too, with no sign of a concussion from the blow.\n\nGET THE SURE OUT: Ricky Nolasco pitched out of bases-loaded, no-outs jam in the sixth inning, partly because of a spectacular diving stop by Brian Dozier, and a nice stretch by Joe Mauer at first base to catch Dozier's hurried throw while keeping a toe on the bag. One run scored in the inning, though, on the play just before Dozier's gem, a tapper up the first-base line. Nolasco grabbed the ball in a hurry, but chose to concede the run and throw to first base rather than home. The 6-1 score at the time was part of the reason, he said. \"I had my back to home plate. I'm not going to turn around and force anything with a 6-1 lead. I'd rather take the out and take my chances with the next guy,\" he said. \"The last thing I want to do is spin around and launch the ball to the backstop or something, and then they get a huge rally.\"\n\nHe's been victimized by rallies before. Nolasco has lost two victories in the past month due to the bullpen's failure to hold his leads, but there was litle chance of that Saturday. Nolasco, 6-12 in his first season with the Twins, recorded his first win since July 1, and admitted it felt good. \"Absoutely. I've always been a firm believer in that,\" he said. \"The main goal is team wins, but it's nice to have those W's next to your name.\"\n\nHE'S TROLLING YOU: Gardenhire had another message for his critics on Saturday. \"I get [complaints] all the time,\" he said. \"I can throw it back every once in awhile.\"\n\nThe Twins' manager did just that on Friday, first by ordering Eduardo Escobar to sacrifice with two runners on base and no outs while holding a 4-0 lead in the fourth inning, then by taunting those who disagree with the strategy after the game.\n\n\"I know people hate it when we bunt. Everybody says the stats and numbers tell you not to do it,\" he said. \"But you know what, when you put pressure on the defense, they've got to make a perfect play. It didn't happen, we scored runs, so ha-ha!\"\n\nHe doesn't enjoy the criticism, Gardenhire said, but he long ago realized it was part of the job that he can't change. With the rise of social media and the increasing number of articles written about his team, he hears a lot more \"suggestions\" about how to do his job.\n\n\"There's a lot of opinions out there. I mean, if I bunt, I hear about it. Why would you bunt, give up an out?\" he said. \"Well, bunting's been in baseball as long as I've been in, [and] we're going to bunt when I think we should bunt.\"","934":"Postgame: Rookies running out of gas? Say this for Twins fans, they keep turning out. I had expected attendance to fall through the floor once the last-place Diamondbacks came to town, but there was a respectable crowd to watch the Twins clinch their fourth straight 90-loss season. Here are a few leftovers:\n\nRUNNING ARIZONA: Kurt Suzuki has thrown out 25 percent of would-be basestealers this season, and he's only given up (along with the pitchers he's caught) 56 steals. So the Diamondbacks' speed was certainly noticeable on Monday night. Arizona became the first team all season to steal three bases in a game that Suzuki has caught. But not every base-stealing attempt was successful. For one thing, Suzuki threw out Jake Lamb in the sixth inning. In the Diamondbacks' five-run fifth inning, A.J. Pollock took off for second base with David Peralta at the plate. He was safe, but Peralta got in the way of the catcher as he threw. \"The bat came back through the zone. It's automatic -- the hitter is out, and you've got to send the runner back,\" said Twins manager Ron Gardenhire, and home plate ump Gary Cederstrom ordered exactly that. \"Suzuki took it right off the finger pretty good.\" Pollock didn't wait long for another chance, though; he stole second again on Ricky Nolasco's next pitch. And he trotted home one pitch after that, since Mark Trumbo belted it into the flower pots in right field.\n\nRUNNING ON EMPTY: The rookies have been so good over the past two months, it's really noticeable when they're off their game. So it was Monday night, when Danny Santana, Kennys Vargas and Oswaldo Arcia combined to go 0-for-12 with four strikeouts. Santana is now 2-for-18 over the past four games, with nine strikeouts. Vargas is 1-for-11 over his past three games, with four strikeouts. And Arcia is 0-for-11 with five strikeouts. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a feeling of school's-almost-out for that threesome, considering what a rush it's all been for them. They've got to be exhausted.\n\nNEW ARMS, GOOD RESULTS: Some good work tonight by both bullpens, and the Twins have to be excited about what they saw. A.J. Achter, Lester Oliveros, Michael Tonkin and Ryan Pressly all pitched at least an inning, and while only Pressly had a 1-2-3 inning, all looked reasonably good. And only Pressly has any meaningful major-league experience, so this is the sort of work that could help the young pitchers develop. Achter gave up two hits, but pitched out of trouble. Oliveros gave up a leadoff double, but struck out Mark Trumbo and Miguel Montero to keep the run from scoring. And while Michael Tonkin gave up a run, the Twins conceded it on a ground out to short. All in all, the group of three September rookies and Pressly combined for 4 1\/3 innings, and just one run, while striking out four.","935":"Postgame: Santana eats first-pitch cookie A.J. Achter and his first big-league win were the story tonight, but there were others. Here are a few leftovers:\n\nFIRST-PITCH COOKIE: It took the Twins only two pitches to take a lead against Rick Porcello on Friday. Danny Santana whacked the first pitch of the game to the fence in left-center for a double, and he scored when Brian Dozier lined Porcello's next pitch into left field. The double was a bit of a breakthrough for the Twins' leadoff hitter, manager Ron Gardenhire said. \"We've been talking to him about being a leadoff hitter, taking pitches and everything. But we also talked to him about, if they throw a cookie [on the] first pitch, hit it,\" Gardenhire said. \"And today, he had a big smile on his face, because that's the first time he's done that in a long time -- swung at first pitch and actually whacked it.\" He has a point: Santana has only put the first pitch in play 33 times all season, but he is 17-for-33 (.515) when he does so.\n\nNO GET-ME-OVERS: Anthony Swarzak sounded like a man who has a new approach -- never give in -- after his four-plus-inning start on Friday. \"I gave it everything I had out there. I didn't take one pitch off. there wasn't one get-me-over [pitch] tonight,\" he said. \"I went at them with my best stuff, and they strung some hits together in a row at the end.\" He didn't allow a hit through the first three innings, but ended up surrendering three runs. \"I felt great. The first three innings speak for themselves, and even the fourth and fifth inning, I felt great. To be honest, I just couldn't execute with two strikes.\"\n\nGARDY DEFENDS BUNT: With the Twins leading 4-0 in the fourth inning, Chris Herrmann led off with a double and Aaron Hicks drew a walk. Gardenhire then ordered Eduardo Escobar to sacrifice, and his bunt moved the runners up to second and third. Danny Santana struck out, but when Brian Dozier's slow roller to third resulted in a bad throw by third baseman Nick Castellanos (though first baseman Miguel Cabrera probably should have caught the bounce), both runners scored. Gardenhire has heard from critics, on his radio show and elsewhere, who don't like sacrifice bunts, so he was ready to defend the bunt after the game. \"I know people hate it when we bunt. Everybody says the stats and numbers tell you not to do it,\" he said with tongue in cheek. \"But you know what, when you put pressure on the defense, they've got to make a perfect play. It didn't happen, we scored runs, so ha-ha!\"","936":"Postgame: Twins could have used Schafer A trio of leftovers as the Twins head into the season's final weekend:\n\nCOULD HAVE USED HIM: Jordan Schafer hyperextended his right elbow while swinging a weighted bat in the on-deck circle 10 days ago, and it might have cost the Twins the game on Thursday. Without Schafer, manager Ron Gardenhire had to use Chris Herrmann in left field, and his place in the lineup hurt the Twins repeatedly. Schafer is 3-for-8 in his career against Tigers starter Max Scherzer, but far more important, he's a more accomplished offensive player than Herrmann, who owns a career batting average of .191. In the second inning, Scherzer walked a pair of hitters, but got Herrmann looking by blowing a 96-mph fastball by him. Two innings later, Oswaldo Arcia was on third base, but Scherzer stranded him there by whiffing Herrmann again. And in the sixth inning, with Scherzer's pitch count climbing above 100, Kurt Suzuki led off with a solid single. But Scherzer blew another fastball by Herrmann for strike three, and the inning amounted to nothing. Maybe a healthy Schafer collects a hit, or puts the ball in play, during one of those at-bats, and the Twins add another run or two.\n\nNAGGING INJURY: Speaking of Schafer, he sounded a little bewildered that his elbow is still bothering him. \"I've been trying to battle through it, but it just hasn't gotten better yet,\" he said. \"Let's see how I feel tomorrow.\" The utility outfielder is only 4-for-23 since suffering the injury, so it might be hampering him.\n\nFINISH WITH A FLOURISH: Trevor May didn't exactly outduel Max Scherzer on Thursday, but it sort of seemed like it, especially since he walked only one batter (and it was intentional) to Scherzer's four. But the rookie ended with a flourish. After giving up a two-out double to Victor Martinez in the sixth, and putting J.D. Martinez on once the count got to 3-1, May engaged in a 10-pitch battle with Nick Castellanos. May clearly wanted to keep the Tigers within one run of the Twins, and finally, with a 3-2 fastball, he got Castellanos to swing through a pitch. \"To come and get that big strikeout there to get out of that inning was huge for him,\" Gardenhire said. \"That's a great way to end the season. He's pitched a lot of innings, and that's a great way to go about your business at the end. It was an important out, and now he leaves on a good note here.\"","937":"Potential for a Late Week Slush Storm \"Intense storms hits northwestern India, causing severe crop damage and claiming lives of at least 28 people\"\n\nVery heavy rains accompanied by lightning and destructive hailstorms hit northwestern India, particularly Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, this week, causing severe crop damage and claiming the lives of at least 28 people. Meteorologists said the storms were triggered by a western disturbance -- extratropical cyclonic storm originating in the Mediterranean Sea. The storms are following one of the coldest winter seasons on record. Delhi has already recorded its wettest March on record. Rains in and around Delhi started on Tuesday, March 10 and continued through Saturday, March 14, when the city recorded 37 mm (1.45 inches), according to data provided by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). Other notable 24-hour March records are 56.8 mm (2.23 inches) on March 2, 2015, 27.2 mm (1.07 inches) on March 13, 2007 and 20.6 mm (0.81 inches) in March 2005 -- making Saturday, March 14, the second-wettest March day on record. Official recording station for Delhi, the Safdarjung observatory, recorded 101.9 mm (4.01 inches) of rainfall by March 15, which is already the highest March rainfall ever recorded. The city recored 97.4 mm (3.83 inches) of rain during the entire month of March in 2015, 61.6 mm (2.42 inches) in 2997 and 36.5 mm (1.43 inches) in 1995. Heavy rains over Delhi follow one of its coldest winter seasons in years.\n\n\"Days of heavy rain cause destructive flooding and mudslides, Solomon Islands\"\n\n\"Days of heavy rain caused severe flooding across parts of the Solomon Islands, particularly across Guadalcanal and Malaita islands. A large landslide hit Lambi on March 12, 2020, destroying at least 10 houses. Authorities said 2 people have been killed, while 6 others remain under the rubble. Severe damage has been reported, particularly to roads and bridges, after flooding swept across Guadalcanal and Malaita islands. It also caused the Taba river in North Malaita to break its banks. Initial reports said eight people, including children, were buried after a large mudslide hit Savaolu village in Lambi, West Guadalcanal on March 12. Search and rescue teams retrieved two bodies so far, but six others remain missing. \"The roads were covered with mud and heaps of logs and rubbish can be seen,\" Solomon Star's Guadalcanal stringer John Toki reported after visiting Lambi. \"More than ten houses were washed away by the flood at Savaolu village, while some of the houses were partly damaged leaving logs and muds all over the village. The food gardens and water sources that the people usually used to collect water for cooking and drinking were now badly affected.

Dominant Daniel - It hasn't been often this year when one of the most talented centers in recent Gophers history struggled for one game let alone in back-to-back losses. Sophomore Daniel Oturu has been that special this season. But the 6-foot-10 Oturu had trouble with not only being dominant but just being half as productive as he normally is in Big Ten play. In a third straight loss Wednesday against Indiana, the former Cretin-Derham Hall star had just 11 points on 5-for-15 shooting from the field in 34 minutes (two points on 1-for-7 shooting and three turnovers in the second half). For the first time this year, Oturu was severely outplayed by the opposing big man with Indiana freshman Trayce Jackson-Davis racking up a career-high 27 points and 16 rebounds (Jackson-Davis had 17 points, 12 rebounds and two blocks in the second half). It was Oturu's lowest scoring game at home in Big Ten play. In the last two games, he's averaging 13 points on 39.3 percent (11 for 28) from the field and 36.4 percent on free throws (4-for-11). It was a significant drop off from his averages of 21.5 points on 54.1 percent shooting from the field and 71.4 percent from the foul line prior to that in the Big Ten. Will the Gophers see Oturu return to his old self Sunday against Northwestern's freshman Ryan Young? Oturu had 19 points, 16 rebounds and five blocks in the Jan. 5 win against Young at the Barn.\n\nBackcourt battle - The last time the Gophers played the Wildcats in a 77-68 win in Minneapolis, their opponent had just one guard in the starting lineup, Pat Spencer. The former lacrosse star turned Division I basketball player surprisingly outplayed Minnesota's talented point guard Marcus Carr. Spencer, a powerfully-built 6-3 senior, scored 22 points on 9-for-18 shooting and had eight assists in 39 minutes. Carr struggled shooting from the field (3 for 11), but he finished with 17 points on 10-for-10 shooting at the foul line. One of the bright spots from the game was freshman Tre' Williams' career-high 10 points in a starting role. Junior Payton Willis had just returned after missing three games with an ankle injury, but he came off the bench. In Sunday's matchup, Northwestern will have freshman standout Boo Buie, who was sidelined in the last meeting at the Barn. Buie averages 11.4 points and shoots 37 percent from three-point range in Big Ten play, which includes highs of 26 points vs. Michigan State and 19 points vs. Rutgers. It should be an intriguing backcourt battle Sunday between Northwestern's Buie and Spencer vs. Minnesota's Carr, Willis and Gabe Kalscheur, who is coming off a 1-for-11 shooting performance against Indiana.\n\nSecond chance points - Richard Pitino admitted Wednesday that he had never seen a stat like 13 offensive rebounds and zero second-chance points in the Gophers' loss to Indiana. That makes two of us. That's really hard to do when you think about it, but the failure to take advantage of so many offensive boards contributed to the 68-56 loss against the Hoosiers. Indiana outrebounded Minnesota 21-19 in the second half, but it had fewer offensive boards 8-6. That didn't matter. The Gophers were outscored 8-0 in second chance points in the second half. Coincidentally, they also gave up an 8-0 run to end the game after cutting it to a four-point deficit with just over two minutes to play. Oturu failed to convert on five of those offensive rebounds in the game. Credit Indiana's post defense on him. But six other Minnesota players also grabbed boards on the offensive end as well - with no points to show for it. Pitino's team had a much better showing in a 58-55 loss against Iowa with 15 second chance points on 12 offensive rebounds. There's something, though, about the Gophers just struggling to get second chance points in the second half in the last two games. They had just two points in that area against the Hawkeyes. In the last two losses, the Gophers have been outscored 34-20 in points in the paint and 14-2 in second chance points in the second half. Not going to cut it.\n\nKey reserves- Tre' Williams, G, 6-5, Fr., 3.3 ppg; Jarvis Omersa, F, 6-7, So., 1.9 ppg; Michael Hurt, F, 6-7, Sr., 1.4 ppg; Isaiah Ihnen, F, 6-9, Fr., 2.1 ppg.\n\nCoach: Richard Pitino 142-119 (8th season overall)\n\nNotable: Redshirt junior big man Eric Curry had successful surgery in the fall on a torn ACL in his right knee suffered during practice Oct. 7. The 6-9 redshirt junior hasn't played a full season since his freshman year in 2016-17 after tearing ligaments in his left knee in 2017 and foot surgery last season. The last time Curry saw the court for the Gophers was with six points, four rebounds and two blocks in 13 minutes in a win at Northwestern on Feb. 28, 2019. Curry's best performance last season was with 11 points and four rebounds in 25 minutes off the bench in a 65-64 victory against Penn State on Jan. 19 at the Barn ... The Gophers shot just 10-for-19 from the free throw line Wednesday against Indiana, but they were 19-for-19 on foul shots in the last win against Northwestern.\n\nKey reserves - A.J. Turner, F, 6-7, Sr., 4.9 ppg; Pete Nance, F, 6-10, So., 7.9 ppg; Jared Jones, F, 6-10, Fr., 3.0 ppg; Ryan Greer, G, 6-3, Jr., 1.1 ppg.\n\nCoach: Chris Collins 107-115 (7th season)\n\nNotable: The Wildcats were down to just seven scholarship players with Anthony Gaines, Buie and A.J. Turner sidelined with injuries in the Jan. 5 loss at Minnesota. Collins' team is much healthier now. Turner and Buie are back, but Gaines is out for the season. In the last 15 games, sophomore Miller Kopp is averaging 14.9 points, shooting 41 percent from three and scored in double figures 14 times. Kopp had 14 points in 40 minutes against the Gophers in the last meeting, including 12 points in the second half.","941":"Pregame: Can the Gophers stop the season trend of poor finishes in close games? Finishing strong - If this turns out to be a Gophers basketball season defined by missed opportunities, the biggest one of them all so far was Sunday's 58-55 loss against Iowa at Williams Arena. Just when the first sellout crowd of the season thought they were about to watch their team earn a much-needed quality win it all fell apart in the last handful of minutes. The Hawkeyes outscored the Gophers 11-0 after trailing 55-47 with 5:25 to play. It was only the second time this season (11-1 record previously) that Minnesota lost when leading with five minutes left. The other loss happened in an 83-78 double-overtime defeat at Purdue on Jan. 2. In both games, the Gophers allowed their opponent to gain momentum by giving up the ball. On Sunday, Minnesota's five turnovers in six possessions (also two 10-second calls for not passing midcourt) basically handed the victory over to Iowa on a silver platter. They played not to lose, so they did. Sunday made it the ninth loss by single digits this season. NINTH. The trend is the Gophers can't win close games, so it's up to them to fix that. The Hoosiers have just as much pressure on them, trying to solidify themselves on the NCAA tournament bubble. Richard Pitino didn't spend time watching film of the late-game collapse vs. Iowa with his players. Maybe that will help Minnesota move on to finish strong Wednesday against Indiana.\n\nMore points at the foul line - The Gophers struggled to get points at the foul line earlier in the season, which contributed to four losses in nonconference play. Pitino addressed the issue. It got better for a period of time, but his team is still inconsistent in that area. Of course, star sophomore Daniel Oturu missing the first of two potential free throws with a chance to tie the game with 3.5 seconds left Sunday was a deflating end to a rough loss. But the Gophers shot just 6-for-12 on free throws, including Oturu going 3-for-7. Pitino's team dropped to 4-10 this season when the opponent attempts more free throws. Oturu and point guard Marcus Carr are the only U players who get to the foul line consistently. And that's a huge part of the problem. In the last two losses (also at Penn State), the Gophers shot 17-for-25 combined at the charity stripe, but Carr and Oturu accounted for 16-for-23. That's just one point on free throws (from Alihan Demir) from the rest of the team in two critical Big Ten games. Starting guard Gabe Kalscheur has gone without attempting a free throw in six of the last eight games, including the last two losses. Same goes for fellow backcourt mate Payton Willis, who hasn't gone to the foul line in seven of his last 10 games, including the last two games. Carr and Oturu have made 75.7 percent of the team's free throws in Big Ten play (128 of 169). The rest of the team has accounted for just 41 points at the line in 14 league games.\n\nDefensive impact - Everyone watching the Gophers implode offensively late in the Iowa loss likely wondered the same thing. Why couldn't they handle a zone or press? Most Big Ten teams don't run the 1--2-2 three quarter-court press into a zone like the Hawkeyes. But Minnesota has to be able to shoot better than 29 percent from three-point range to keep defenses honest, which ranks last in Big Ten play. Indiana is 13th in league play in field goal defense (45 percent) and three-point defense (35.7 percent), so this might be a game where the Gophers can break out a bit offensively from the outside. If Pitino's offense goes through long shooting slumps Wednesday, the Gophers defense should be able to keep them in the game. They rank fifth in Big Ten play holding opponents to 41 percent shooting from the field.\n\nKey reserves- Tre' Williams, G, 6-5, Fr., 3.4 ppg; Jarvis Omersa, F, 6-7, So., 1.9 ppg; Michael Hurt, F, 6-7, Sr., 1.5 ppg; Isaiah Ihnen, F, 6-9, Fr., 1.9 ppg.\n\nCoach: Richard Pitino 142-118 (8th season overall)\n\nNotable: The Gophers were currently on only six of a possible 108 NCAA tournament bracket projections, according to the Bracket Matrix online tracker before Wednesday's games. They fell off the bubble in most predictions with Sunday's loss against Iowa, but their metrics still are bubble worthy. Minnesota's NET ranking is No. 44 and strength of schedule (SOS) is No. 27. Based on Wednesday's NET rankings, Pitino's team also is 5-10 in Quadrant 1 games. If you take overall record out of the mix, the Gophers have a better NET, SOS and Quad 1 win total than Indiana. Still, the NCAA tournament selection committee won't consider a team with a .500 record. Last season, Minnesota received an at-large bid going 6-11 in Quad 1 games and SOS at No. 39.\n\nKey reserves - Devonte Green, G, 6-3, Sr., 10.6 ppg; Jerome Hunter, G, 6-4, So., 4.3 ppg; De'Ron Davis, C, 6-10, Sr., 2.8 ppg; Race Thompson, F, 6-8, So., 3.1 ppg; Armaan Franklin, G, 6-4, Fr., 4.0 ppg.\n\nCoach: Archie Miller 190-103 (9th season)\n\nNotable: The Hoosiers are among ESPN bracket expert Joe Lunardi's \"First Four Out\" as of early Wednesday. They were comfortably in the NCAA tournament projections until suffering five losses in their last six games, including 89-65 at Michigan on Sunday. Indiana had snapped a four-game losing streak last week with a 89-77 win at home vs. Iowa ... Hoosiers sophomore forward Race Thompson had a career-high 10 points and four steals in 24 minutes recently against Iowa. The 6-foot-8 former Armstrong standout was limited the last two seasons with injuries, but he's averaging 3.1 points and 3.3 rebounds in 22 games this year.","942":"Pregame: Gophers and Penn State try to keep competitive fire from boiling over Oturu vs. Stevens II - Social media was buzzing when Gophers star sophomore center Daniel Oturu's heated exchange with senior forward Lamar Stevens in the postgame handshake line was caught on video after the Gophers 75-69 win against Penn State last month. It wasn't a good look for either player. The squabble was a continuation of the trash talking that went on during the game. Oturu dominated the matchup with the Nittany Lions frontcourt with 26 points and 14 rebounds. Stevens wasn't that impactful with 14 points on 5-for-13 shooting. Neither was senior center Mike Watkins (seven points and five rebounds). The most memorable Watkins moment was when he confronted Oturu face-to-face during a physical sequence in the second half. Pitino understands the competitiveness of both sides. But Pitino said, \"more than anything find a way to compete at the high level but do it the right way.\" On the rematch with Oturu, Stevens told local media this week: \"We're two big time competitors but I'm focused on my team, focused on getting myself ready for this game. Stuff like that happens, but I don't let that stick with me.\"\n\nCarr's consistency - Richard Pitino heard from his coaching staff at the end of Wednesday's win against Wisconsin that Marcus Carr only needed one rebound to reach a triple-double. \"What do you want me to tell him to miss? We're not going to do that,\" Pitino told them. It would've been the first triple-double in program history since Mychal Thompson in 1976. Carr's scoring wasn't the story in a 70-52 victory against the Badgers. The sophomore point guard scored under his average with 12 points on 5-for-15 shooting and 2-for-6 free throws, but he had 10 assists and nine rebounds. In the earlier win against Penn State at home, the Toronto native exploded for 27 points (10 for 11 free throws) with nine assists and six rebounds. Carr has four games of 20-plus points at home this season, but he's averaging 12 points on 29 percent shooting away from the Barn. The Gophers are 1-7 in true road games this season. It's no surprise that the lone road win came when Carr led the way with 21 points, including the game-winning three-pointer in a Jan. 23 win at Ohio State. Junior Payton Willis returning from a shoulder injury to put up 21 points against Wisconsin took pressure off Carr from having to carry the offense on the perimeter.\n\nDefensive impact - The Gophers arguably had their worst defensive performance of the season in the first half of their last meeting with Penn State at home. The Nittany Lions shot 60 percent from the field (18 for 30) and led by as much as eight points at the Barn. It was a completely different effort in the second half for Minnesota, which held Penn State to 24 percent shooting (7 for 29), including 1-for-10 shooting from three-point range. Pitino's team defeated Wisconsin by its largest margin in the series since 1994, but it was defense that stood out the most. The Gophers had 45 points in the first half, but they also held their rival to 28 percent shooting from the field. Wisconsin's starters were 15-for-46 on field goals combined. Minnesota ranks fifth in the Big Ten in field goal percentage defense (40.3) through 12 league games.\n\nKey reserves - Tre' Williams, G, 6-5, Fr., 3.4 ppg; Jarvis Omersa, F, 6-7, So., 2.1 ppg; Michael Hurt, F, 6-7, Sr., 1.7 ppg; Isaiah Ihnen, F, 6-9, Fr., 1.8 ppg\n\nCoach: Richard Pitino 142-116 (8th season overall)\n\nNotable: Redshirt junior big man Eric Curry had successful surgery in the fall on a torn ACL in his right knee suffered during practice Oct. 7. The 6-9 redshirt junior hasn't played a full season since his freshman year in 2016-17 after tearing ligaments in his left knee in 2017 and foot surgery last season. The last time Curry saw the court for the Gophers was with six points, four rebounds and two blocks in 13 minutes in a win at Northwestern on Feb. 28, 2019. Curry's best performance last season was with 11 points and four rebounds in 25 minutes off the bench in a 65-64 victory against Penn State on Jan. 19 at the Barn.\n\nKey reserves - Curtis Jones, G, 6-4, Sr., 7.1 ppg; Izaiah Brockington, G, 6-4, So., 10.8 ppg; Mike Watkins, C, 6-9, Sr., 9.8 ppg; Myles Dread, G, 6-4, So., 7.8 ppg.\n\nCoach: Pat Chambers 186-173 (11th season)\n\nNotable: Penn State was ranked No. 20 in the nation last month after winning five straight games, including against Maryland and Iowa. The Nittany Lions earned their first national ranking in 23 years this season, but they dropped out of the rankings after losses to Rutgers, Wisconsin and Minnesota. Two of those games were on the road. Three of the five straight victories since have been on the road, including at Michigan State earlier this week. Pat Chambers' team is back in the rankings and announced its first sellout crowd Saturday since 2011 ... Watkins had 21 points and 25 rebounds combined in the last two victories against Nebraska and Michigan State. Watkins racked up 15 points and 15 rebounds in Penn State's last win against the Gophers, 52-50 in State College on Jan. 14, 2017.","943":"Pregame: Gophers frontcourt rotation could look different at Indiana Frontcourt rotation - In the second half of Sunday's 71-69 loss at Wisconsin, freshman Isaiah Ihnen started in place of senior Alihan Demir, who has been struggling offensively for several games. Was that a sign of things to come Wednesday? Ihnen, a former four-star recruit, has seen his playing time increase after not being part of the rotation earlier in Big Ten play. He finished with six points and a career-best 10 rebounds in 24 minutes against the Badgers. Demir finished with just two points on 1-for-4 shooting and four rebounds in 15 minutes. It was the 12th straight game for Demir failing to score in double figures. He's shooting 31.4 percent from the field during that stretch, including a current streak of 20 straight misses from three-point range (dating back to Jan. 15 against Penn State). Is it time to tweak the starting lineup alongside sophomore standout Daniel Oturu? At this point it probably doesn't make a difference who starts. Ihnen finished Sunday's game, but he also showed his inexperience with a defensive mistake when Wisconsin's Aleem Ford cut backdoor for a dunk with 30 seconds left. Still, Ihnen, Oturu and Tre' Williams were the only players finishing positive in the plus-minus category. Ihnen was the only frontcourt player to play more than four minutes against the Badgers as well. Jarvis Omersa and Michael Hurt had fewer than nine minutes combined. Does that same rotation continue against the Hoosiers?\n\nSecond chance points - The Gophers recorded one of the most bizarre stat lines in college basketball this season in the 68-56 loss Feb. 19 against Indiana at Williams Arena. They grabbed 13 offensive rebounds, but they had no second chance points to show for it. Head scratcher, right. There were several factors that led to arguably the most embarrassing home loss of the season. That was definitely the one that jumps out after scanning the box score. So, what happens in the rematch Wednesday at Assembly Hall? Well, Richard Pitino's team has been much better turning offensive boards into points since last playing the Hoosiers. They had 16 second chance points on 12 offensive rebounds in a 83-57 win at Northwestern. They had 12 second chance points on 12 offensive boards in a 74-73 loss last week vs. Maryland. They had 13 second chance points on 12 offensive boards in a 71-69 loss Sunday at Wisconsin. In the last three games, Minnesota has outgained opponents 41-36 in second chance points combined, but Maryland was the only team that finished with the advantage in the game (18-12). Oturu is averaging 25.3 points and 11.7 rebounds in the last three games, which is partly from crashing the glass offensively (nine offensive rebounds in three games). Indiana has lost two games in a row with both opponents (Purdue and Illinois) having the edge in second chance points.\n\nContaining Jackson-Davis - Part of limiting Indiana's freshman standout Trayce Jackson-Davis is making him foul and use up energy playing defense. He'll likely spend time matching up with Oturu, who didn't fair well in their 1-on-1 battle the first time around. Oturu finished with 11 points on 5-for-15 shooting (his lowest scoring total in a Big Ten home game). He had 14 rebounds, but also shot just 1-for-4 from the foul line. Meanwhile, Jackson-Davis had 27 points on 11-for-15 shooting and 16 rebounds, both career-highs, including 17 points in the second half. No other starter scored in double figures for Indiana. Pitino didn't see that coming, neither did Minnesota's players. They'll be more prepared this time, but Jackson-Davis hasn't played nearly as well since the last meeting. The 6-9 former McDonald's All-American is averaging 10.3 points on 39.4 percent shooting in his last three games.\n\nKey reserves - Tre' Williams, G, 6-5, Fr., 3.1 ppg; Jarvis Omersa, F, 6-7, So., 2.0 ppg; Michael Hurt, F, 6-7, Sr., 1.3 ppg; Isaiah Ihnen, F, 6-9, Fr., 2.7 ppg.\n\nCoach: Richard Pitino 143-121 (8th season overall)\n\nNotable: Freshman forward Isaiah Ihnen had six points and a career-high 10 rebounds Sunday at Wisconsin in 24 minutes off the bench. Ihnen returned from a wrist injury to score a career-best nine points on 3-for-7 shooting from three-point range the previous game in a loss against Maryland. The 6-9 German native missed the previous game at Northwestern after hurting his right wrist in practice. Ihnen came back even stronger with three three-pointers in the first half to help lead the Gophers to a 17-point lead against the Big Ten's top team. Ihnen had combined for 10 points and three blocks in losses to Indiana and Iowa that showed he was progressing ... Marcus Carr is five assists away from breaking the Gophers' single-season Big Ten assists record held by Ray Williams with 118 in 1976-77. The sophomore point guard already set the overall school single-season record for assists by reaching 182 in the Maryland loss.\n\nKey reserves - Devonte Green, G, 6-3, Sr., 10.7 ppg; Jerome Hunter, G, 6-4, So., 4.0 ppg; De'Ron Davis, C, 6-10, Sr., 2.7 ppg; Race Thompson, F, 6-8, So., 3.6 ppg; Armaan Franklin, G, 6-4, Fr., 3.7 ppg.\n\nCoach: Archie Miller 192-105 (9th season)\n\nNotable: The Hoosiers are among ESPN bracket expert Joe Lunardi's \"Last Four Byes\" as of early Wednesday. They were comfortably in the NCAA tournament projections earlier in the season until suffering four straight losses, also five losses in six games before winning by 12 at Minnesota on Feb. 19. Entering Wednesday, Indiana has six Quad 1 wins (18th most nationally), four wins vs. top 25 teams (fourth most nationally), rank 38 by KenPom.com and 54 in the NET rankings ... In the last meeting with the Gophers, redshirt sophomore Race Thompson had nine points and a career-high 10 rebounds against his home state program. Thompson, a former Armstrong star, is averaging 3.6 points and 3.8 rebounds in 13.3 minutes off the bench this season.","944":"Pregame: Gophers hope to 'Let it fly' again from three-point range in Big Ten tourney GOPHERS MEN'S HOOPS vs. NORTHWESTERN (Big Ten tournament)\n\nThree things to watch:\n\n'LET IT FLY' - Gabe Kalscheur felt no pressure last Sunday. For almost the entire Big Ten season, Kalscheur had been asked about how he handled seeing his three-point shooting numbers drop from last season. He never let that affect how hard he worked to help his team defensively in games - guarding the opponent's perimeter player. The sophomore from Edina kept shooting, but he never quite could have the breakout game everyone expected. Then it happened with a career-Big Ten high 26 points and a school-record tying eight three-pointers in the 107-75 win against Nebraska on Senior Day. Kalscheur said he just thought about winning the game for the seniors and \"let it fly\" from long range. The rest is history. The Gophers drilled a school-record 18 three-pointers, breaking the previous mark of 16 set against Michigan State in 2001. Seven different players hit shots from beyond the arc, including starting guard Marcus Carr (4-for-5), Payton Willis (2-for-6) and reserve forward Isaiah Ihnen (1-for-3). Kalscheur surprisingly still shot just 29.9 percent (41-for-137) from three in 20 conference games. Carr led the team shooting 38.2 percent (34-for-89), followed by center Daniel Oturu and Ihnen both at 37.1 percent (13-for-35). As a team, Minnesota finished ninth in the Big Ten this season at 31.6 percent from long distance, but you obviously saw what Richard Pitino's team could do at its best (18-for-35 against Nebraska). Can the Gophers continue to be a threat from three-point range in the Big Ten tournament? The last time they played the Wildcats, Kalscheur and company shot 14-for-30 from three in an 83-57 win in Evanston, including Kalscheur (4-for-9), Willis (4-for-8), Carr (3-for-5) and Oturu (3-for-5) all making at least three shots from the arc.\n\nCARR'S CONSISTENCY - One of Carr's goals this season was to earn All-Big Ten honors, so he was grateful to receive the news Monday he was named all-conference third team by the media. It was bittersweet, though, because he expected the Gophers to win a lot more games in the process. Part of the inconsistency of the team this year came from the up-and-down play of their sophomore point guard. Certainly, the losses didn't fall solely on his shoulders. But the Gophers are clearly hard to beat when he's playing at his best. Minnesota is 3-10 this season when Carr scores 12 points or fewer. Interesting stat for a floor general. But part of the brilliance of the Toronto native is that he's a game-changer scoring and facilitating. Case in point was his 18 points and 11 assists and just one turnover in Sunday's win against Nebraska. The team tied a school record with 32 assists, but it started with Carr attacking. He drew defenders and opened shots up for his teammates. His taking advantage of the matchup with Northwestern freshman Boo Buie might be the most important factor in a win Wednesday night.\n\nALL-BIG TEN MOTIVATION - Remember when the Gophers wore \"No respect\" shirts during warmups to open the Big Ten tournament in 2010? That had to do with former Gophers forward Damian Johnson being left off the Big Ten All-Defensive team despite leading the league in steals and finishing in the top three in blocks. Johnson was arguably the league's best defender, so his teammates took offense to the snub. Sound familiar? Oturu definitely felt that way Monday when he was absent on the all-league first team. Sure, there were probably 8-10 players with resumes deserving to be selected. Only one (Big Ten player of the year Luka Garza) had better numbers than Oturu in some areas. The 6-foot-10 sophomore became the first Big Ten player since Ohio State's Greg Oden in 2007 to lead the Big Ten in rebounding (11.6), field goal percentage (56.2) and blocks (2.6). Not to mention, his 20 points per game ranked only behind Garza in the conference. Winning should mean something. Not everything, though, when you put up those type of stats in arguably the best conference in college hoops. Plus, Minnesota's 8-12 record wasn't putrid, either. Oturu was named to the Sporting News All-America third team Wednesday, but he might still use the all-league snub as motivation to dominate the paint even more in Indianapolis.\n\nKey reserves - Tre' Williams, G, 6-5, Fr., 3.1 ppg; Jarvis Omersa, F, 6-7, So., 1.9 ppg; Michael Hurt, F, 6-7, Sr., 1.5 ppg; Isaiah Ihnen, F, 6-9, Fr., 3.3 ppg.\n\nCoach: Richard Pitino 144-122 (8th season overall)\n\nNotable: Freshman forward Isaiah Ihnen scored a career-high nine points on 3-for-3 shooting from three-point range (all in the first half) in the 72-67 loss last week at Indiana. Ihnen also had six points and a career-high 10 rebounds last week at Wisconsin in 24 minutes off the bench. He returned from a wrist injury to score a career-best nine points on 3-for-7 shooting from three-point range the previous game in a loss against Maryland. The 6-9 German native missed the previous game at Northwestern after hurting his right wrist in practice. Ihnen came back even stronger with three three-pointers in the first half to help lead the Gophers to a 17-point lead against the Big Ten's top team. Ihnen had combined for 10 points and three blocks in losses to Indiana and Iowa that showed he was progressing ... Marcus Carr broke the Gophers' single-season Big Ten assists record held by Ray Williams with 118 in 1976-77. The sophomore point guard already set the overall school single-season record for assists by reaching 182 in the Maryland loss.\n\nNotable: The Wildcats have five underclassmen who average more than 20 minutes in Big Ten games this season, the most in the Big Ten. They needed experience in their backcourt this season, so Colllins added lacrosse All-American Pat Spencer. The former Loyola (M.D.) standout graduated and transferred to Evanston to become a valuable player in Evanston. The 6-3 senior is averaging 10.5 points, 4.0 rebounds and started 28 games.","945":"Pregame: Gophers look to send seniors off with a win Sunday vs. Nebraska Senior sendoff - Gophers seniors Michael Hurt, Alihan Demir and Brady Rudrud will be honored in their last home game Sunday against Nebraska. Hurt, a Rochester, Minn. native, has played in 109 career games in maroon and gold, including 23 games this season. The 6-foot-7 forward started 14 games as a sophomore during the 2017-18 season when the Gophers suffered several injuries, but his playing time was limited the last two years. Still, Hurt was named a team captain this year and found ways to lead from the bench. Demir, a Drexel transfer, averaged 6.7 points and 4.7 rebounds and started 28 games. He hasn't been as impactful as the Gophers expected as an outside shooting threat (17 percent in Big Ten play from three-point range, including 20 straight misses). But Demir made strides rebounding against stronger frontcourt players in the league. Rudrud was a former walk-on who earned a scholarship this season. The Eden Prairie native had opportunities to play Division II and Division III basketball, but his dream was to play for the Gophers. Rudrud and Hurt have been roommates during their entire career.\n\nOturu swan song - It's been more than a decade since a Gophers big man had the type of impact in one season that sophomore Daniel Oturu experienced this year. The 6-10 former Cretin-Derham Hall standout will likely finish the regular season as the first player in program history to average at least 20 points and 10 rebounds since Kris Humphries in 2004. All signs point to this being Oturu's last game Sunday at the Barn with the chance to be the first Gopher drafted since Humphries was taken in the lottery 15 years ago. Nobody has enjoyed playing for his home state more than Oturu, who could give Gophers fans something to remember in the regular season finale. He's averaging 25 points and 12.8 rebounds in his last four games. Oturu ranks second in the Big Ten in scoring (20.3), but he's No. 1 in rebounding (11.6), blocks (2.5) and field goal percentage (56.2). Who was the last player to lead the Big Ten in those three categories in the regular season? That would be former No. 1 NBA Draft pick and Ohio State center Greg Oden in 2007. Oturu, who had 24 points and 16 rebounds in Wednesday's loss at Indiana, will give Minnesota its third straight Big Ten rebounding champion overall after Jordan Murphy was the league leader in 2018 and 2019.\n\nDepleted backcourt - Nebraska's starting guards Cam Mack and Dachon Burke, who combined to average more than 24 points and eight rebounds this season, have been suspended indefinitely by the school and will not play Sunday vs. the Gophers. Mack, who leads the team with 6.5 assists, was already suspended for Thursday's loss at Michigan for violating team rules. Mack was replaced in the starting lineup by walk-on freshman Charley Easley. The Cornhuskers will be down to only seven scholarship players Sunday. Meanwhile, the Gophers are at full strength in their backcourt with sophomores Marcus Carr and Gabe Kalscheur and junior Payton Willis. Carr and Willis are hoping to bounce back after being held to just 15 points on 5-for-15 shooting combined at Indiana. Kalscheur was the only other Gophers player after Oturu to score in double figures with 14 points, but he shot 1-for-6 from three Wednesday.\n\nKey reserves - Tre' Williams, G, 6-5, Fr., 3.1 ppg; Jarvis Omersa, F, 6-7, So., 1.9 ppg; Michael Hurt, F, 6-7, Sr., 1.3 ppg; Isaiah Ihnen, F, 6-9, Fr., 3.0 ppg.\n\nCoach: Richard Pitino 143-122 (8th season overall)\n\nNotable: Freshman forward Isaiah Ihnen scored a career-high nine points on 3-for-3 shooting from three-point range (all in the first half) in Wednesday's loss at Indiana. Ihnen also had six points and a career-high 10 rebounds last week at Wisconsin in 24 minutes off the bench. He returned from a wrist injury to score a career-best nine points on 3-for-7 shooting from three-point range the previous game in a loss against Maryland. The 6-9 German native missed the previous game at Northwestern after hurting his right wrist in practice. Ihnen came back even stronger with three three-pointers in the first half to help lead the Gophers to a 17-point lead against the Big Ten's top team. Ihnen had combined for 10 points and three blocks in losses to Indiana and Iowa that showed he was progressing ... Marcus Carr broke the Gophers' single-season Big Ten assists record held by Ray Williams with 118 in 1976-77. The sophomore point guard already set the overall school single-season record for assists by reaching 182 in the Maryland loss.\n\nNotable: The Cornhuskers under first-year coach Fred Hoiberg have lost 15 straight games. They are 0-11 on the road, but they have wins against Iowa and Purdue in Big Ten play at home. Five losses have been by single digits, including 72-70 at Maryland on Feb. 11. Nebraska's last victory was on 76-70 on Jan. 7 against the Hawkeyes at Pinnacle Bank Arena in Lincoln. Pitino is 3-6 in his career against the Cornhuskers, including a 88-73 loss at the Barn on March 2, 2017.","946":"Pregame: Gophers' supporting cast for Daniel Oturu could be the key Sunday vs. Iowa The 'Other Guys' - We know the headliners for Sunday afternoon's rivalry game will be the Gophers' Daniel Oturu and Iowa's Luka Garza in the paint. Odds are that both Oturu and Garza will both find ways to shine in starring roles like they have all season. Which team will have the most production from the 'other guys' who have contributed to wins this year? And the nominees to win the Oscar for best supporting actor Sunday are... The Hawkeyes' best candidate will be sophomore wing Joe Wieskamp, who scored a team-high 23 points on 8-for-15 shooting from the field in Iowa's 72-52 win Dec. 9 against the Gophers. Another important supporting cast member for Garza will be senior forward Ryan Kriener, who replaces injured guard CJ Fredrick in Sunday's starting lineup. On Minnesota's side, it's typically been the Oturu and Marcus Carr show this season. But Carr, Payton Willis and Gabe Kalscheur combined to score 44 points in a 70-52 win Feb. 5 against rival Wisconsin at home. The 3-for-29 combined shooting from Minnesota's starting backcourt in the last meeting with Iowa still haunts Richard Pitino and his players, but the Gophers can make up for that abysmal offensive performance in the rematch Sunday.\n\nTransition buckets - Before Pitino could blink to open the first meeting between the Gophers and Hawkeyes, Wieskamp had scored more than half of his team's points. The 6-6 guard was difficult to defend with his ability to penetrate, drill shots from long distance and finish on the break. The latter Wieskamp was doing way too often for Pitino's liking in the first meeting. The Hawkeyes aren't exactly the fastest team in the country, but they ran away literally with the game in December. They outscored the Gophers 18-4 in fastbreak points, which led to uncontested layups and more three-pointers. The Hawkeyes also nailed 10-for-21 three-pointers .\n\nThree-point edge - The Gophers are hard to figure out at home when it comes to three-point shooting. They rank last in the Big Ten in three-point shooting (28.6) in league play, but they shot 9-for-22 from beyond the arc in the last home game vs. Wisconsin. More than half of those three-pointers were from Willis, who had a career-high 21 points with 5-for-7 shooting from three against the Badgers. Iowa ranks fourth as a team in three-point shooting (34 percent) in the league games, but Fredrick was leading the team with 46.7 shooting from three. Wieskamp went 5-for-7 from three when beating the Gophers at home in Iowa City. Guarding the arc hasn't been a strength of the Gophers this season ranking 13th in the conference in three-point defense (opponents shooting 35 percent).\n\nKey reserves- Tre' Williams, G, 6-5, Fr., 3.5 ppg; Jarvis Omersa, F, 6-7, So., 2.0 ppg; Michael Hurt, F, 6-7, Sr., 1.6 ppg; Isaiah Ihnen, F, 6-9, Fr., 1.4 ppg\n\nCoach: Richard Pitino 142-117 (8th season overall)\n\nNotable: Redshirt junior big man Eric Curry had successful surgery in the fall on a torn ACL in his right knee suffered during practice Oct. 7. The 6-9 redshirt junior hasn't played a full season since his freshman year in 2016-17 after tearing ligaments in his left knee in 2017 and foot surgery last season. The last time Curry saw the court for the Gophers was with six points, four rebounds and two blocks in 13 minutes in a win at Northwestern on Feb. 28, 2019. Curry's best performance last season was with 11 points and four rebounds in 25 minutes off the bench in a 65-64 victory against Penn State on Jan. 19 at the Barn.\n\nNotable: The Hawkeyes have been playing most of the season without point guard Jordan Bohannon (hip) and forward Jack Nunge (knee). In his last Big Ten game, Bohannon 10 assists and zero turnovers in a 72-52 win Dec. 9 against Minnesota in Iowa City ... Garza is averaging 27 points in Big Ten play, which included a 38-point performance Thursday against the Hoosiers ... Pemsl returns after a one-game suspension for violating team rules.","947":"Pregame: How much will the Gophers rely on their three-point shooting at Wisconsin? Live by the three - If the Gophers are hitting three-pointers, they can obviously not only play with anyone but dominate them - for a stretch. Best example was when they took a 16-point halftime lead against Big Ten-leading Maryland in Wednesday's 74-73 loss. The Gophers hit seven three-pointers coming off a 26-point win at Northwestern when they drilled 14 three-pointers, tied for the second most in school history. Can they sustain that level of shooting is the problem? Minnesota shot 3-for-11 from beyond the arc in the second half Wednesday, but it had no threes in the final 10:21. Star center Daniel Oturu also didn't get many scoring touches and went without a field goal attempt for a six-minute period down the stretch, a disturbing trend in a few close losses. Meanwhile, the Terrapins hit three from long distance in crunch time, including the game-winning shot from Darryl Morsell with 1.9 seconds to play. How much will Richard Pitino's team rely on outside shooting Sunday against the Badgers? The Gophers shot 9-for-22 from three in a 70-52 win Feb. 5 against Wisconsin at the Barn, including junior Payton Willis' career-high 21 points on 5-for-7 shooting from deep. They led the Badgers 45-32 at halftime on that night after shooting 55 percent in the first half, including 5-for-10 from three. The Badgers shot just 24 percent (7 for 29) on threes in that loss at the Barn, but since then they're shooting 43.9 percent (61 for 139) from beyond the arc (also averaging 12.2 threes per game) in five straight wins. They're also holding opponents to just 32.2 percent shooting from three in that span (only 5.6 threes per game).\n\nWillis' impact - Imagine what Pitino would've done if the Gophers didn't have Willis healthy for the last meeting against the Badgers? The 6-foot-5 former Vanderbilt transfer returned from a shoulder injury to have the best performance of his college career. Willis was lights out in the first half, which help Minnesota set the tone in its first Border Battle win at home since 2015. In the three straight home losses, Willis shot just 4-for-16 from three, which included just three points on 1-for-8 shooting in Wednesday's loss to Maryland. His shooting wasn't the biggest concern in the end. Willis strained his calf at the end of the game, which could hinder him Sunday against the Badgers. Marcus Carr had 19 points and seven assists against Maryland, but he also committed five turnovers. Gabe Kalscheur scored just nine points vs. Maryland. Willis combines both of the skills sets that make Carr and Kalscheur special. He isn't just one of the team's top three-point shooters, but he also takes pressure off Carr as a primary ball handler and Kalscheur defensively.\n\nOturu vs. Reuvers II - Oturu and Nate Reuvers are two Minnesota big men who battled in high school when Cretin-Derham Hall played Lakeville North a few years ago. That rivalry continued in the Border Battle the last two seasons in college. In their last meeting, Oturu had 17 points, 14 rebounds and four blocks in the Gophers' convincing victory. Reuvers had 14 points on 6-for-18 shooting and just three rebounds in the last Wisconsin loss. Clearly, the Badgers have been able to win recently without Reuvers playing near his best basketball. He had a season-low two points on 1-for-2 shooting with four fouls in 18 minutes in Thursday's win at Michigan. Picking up the slack in the frontcourt was Micah Potter and Aleem Ford, who combined for 36 points and 15 rebounds against the Wolverines. Potter had 11 points and a career-high 15 rebounds off the bench at Minnesota last month. The Gophers can't afford for Oturu to struggle Sunday, though. In losses to Iowa and Indiana, Oturu combined to score just 26 points on 11-for-28 shooting. He's returned to his dominant self in the last games with 22 points and 12 rebounds at Northwestern, while putting up 28 points and 11 rebounds against Maryland.\n\nKey reserves- Tre' Williams, G, 6-5, Fr., 3.1 ppg; Jarvis Omersa, F, 6-7, So., 2.0 ppg; Michael Hurt, F, 6-7, Sr., 1.4 ppg; Isaiah Ihnen, F, 6-9, Fr., 2.5 ppg.\n\nCoach: Richard Pitino 143-120 (8th season overall)\n\nNotable: Freshman forward Isaiah Ihnen returned from a wrist injury to score a career-best nine points on 3-for-7 shooting from three-point range in Wednesday's loss to the Terrapins. Ihnen missed the previous game at Northwestern after hurting his right wrist in practice.

Carr is nine assists way from breaking the Gophers' single-season Big Ten assists record held by Ray Williams with 118 in 1976-77. The sophomore point guard already set the overall school single-season record for assists by reaching 182 in the Maryland loss.\n\nKey reserves - Micah Potter, F, 6-10, Jr., 9.9 ppg; Tyler Wahl, F, 6-7, Fr., 2.8 ppg; Trevor Anderson, G, 6-2, Jr., 1.7 ppg; Walt McGrory, G, 6-3, Jr., 1.4 ppg.\n\nCoach: Greg Gard 98-57 (5th season)\n\nNotable: The Badgers haven't been swept in the season series against the Gophers since the 2008-09 season. Wisconsin fell 70-52 on Feb. 5 at Williams Arena, but the two teams have gone in different directions since that last meeting. The Badgers have won five straight games to go from 6-6 in the Big Ten to within striking distance for at least a share of the league title. They enter Sunday's game 1 \u00bd games behind the first place Terrapins.","948":"Pregame: Marcus Carr within reach of Gophers' single-season assist record Carr dishing for record - Marcus Carr is such a talented scorer that you almost forget sometimes he's one of the top passers in the Big Ten, too. The 6-foot-2 sophomore point guard is probably known more for some of his offensive outburst so far as a Gopher, especially his 35-point game in an upset over then-No. 3 Ohio State at home in December. Carr will try to lead his team to another win over a top-10 opponent Wednesday against No. 9 Maryland, but he'll also have a chance to put his name in the history books for something other than scoring. The Toronto native needs only five assists to surpass Arriel McDonald's school's single-season mark in assists with 179. The fact that Carr will likely get the record with three regular season games left after Wednesday is even more impressive. He's averaging 6.7 assists this season, which is second in the Big Ten behind Michigan's Zavier Simpson. Carr outplayed Simpson in a 75-67 win against the Wolverines on Jan. 12 with 21 points, 12 assists and zero turnovers, which was the first 20-point, 12-assist, zero-turnover performance in team history. Don't be surprised if Carr brings his best Wednesday night against Maryland's star point guard Anthony Cowan. Carr bounced back from a couple rough games in home losses to Indiana and Iowa with 18 points and seven assists in Sunday's 83-57 win at Northwestern.\n\nSmith vs. Oturu - Ask Daniel Oturu to name the big men in the Big Ten he studied in the offseason, he'll tell you that one of them was definitely Maryland's Jalen Smith. Both Oturu and Smith are 6-10 sophomores with loads of talent and NBA potential (10 scouts are in attendance to watch them). But Smith possessed a dangerous outside shooting touch that Oturu envied. He liked how Smith stretched the floor, so Oturu added that to his game this season. Smith still shoots almost like a guard at 36.5 percent from three-point range on 27 for 74 shooting this season. Oturu isn't quite as deadly but he became at least a threat from beyond the arc, going from 1 to 15 three-pointers this season. He's shooting a respectable 32.6 percent as a 240-pound center. His confidence is high too from long distance coming off a career best 3-for-5 shooting on threes with 22 points and 12 rebounds vs. Northwestern. Smith had just eight points on 3-for-8 shooting in Sunday's 79-72 loss at Ohio State. But that snapped a streak of nine straight double-doubles during Maryland's nine-game win streak.\n\nThree-point shooting - Can the Gophers repeat their 14 three-pointers from Sunday's win against the Wildcats? Probably not. That doesn't mean they will revert back to the team that shot a Big-Ten worst 27 percent from beyond the arc in league games before last weekend. Richard Pitino and Carr talked Tuesday about ball movement being the key to getting several quality shots from three against Northwestern. Spreading the ball around makes sense, because the Gophers don't just have one outside shooting threat. Carr (3-for-5), Gabe Kalscheur (4-for-9) and Payton Willis (4-for-8) combined to shoot 11-for-22 from deep. The Gophers came just two three-pointers shy of tying the record of 16 set against Michigan State during the 2000-01 season. That year was also the last time Minnesota nailed 14 three-pointers in a Big Ten game at Michigan. This hasn't been a consistent shooting season for Pitino's team to say the least, but it seems more of a confidence thing than being horrible shooters. Kalscheur ranks tied for first with Michigan State's Cassius Winston with a Big Ten-best 63 three-pointers. Willis has missed four games this season, but he still ranks ninth with 49 three-pointers (2.2 threes per game).\n\nKey reserves- Tre' Williams, G, 6-5, Fr., 3.2 ppg; Jarvis Omersa, F, 6-7, So., 2.0 ppg; Michael Hurt, F, 6-7, Sr., 1.4 ppg; Isaiah Ihnen, F, 6-9, Fr., 2.1 ppg.\n\nCoach: Richard Pitino 143-119 (8th season overall)\n\nNotable: Freshman forward Isaiah Ihnen had combined to score 10 points and four blocks in back-to-back games before missing Sunday's win against Northwestern with a wrist injury. Ihnen is available to play Wednesday against Maryland. The 6-foot-9 German native was the highest rated recruit in Pitino's 2019 class, but he needed time to adjust to the Gophers after being sidelined to start the season with the same right wrist injury. Ihnen's most impressive performance was with five points and three blocks in a home loss against Iowa on Feb. 16. Fellow freshman big man Sam Freeman had five points and two rebounds in just three minutes against Northwestern.\n\nKey reserves - Donta Scott, F, 6-7, Fr., 5.9 ppg; Ricky Lindo Jr., F, 6-8, So., 1.9 ppg; Serrel Smith Jr., G, 6-4, So., 1.4 ppg; Chol Marial, C, 7-2, Fr., 1.0 ppg.\n\nCoach: Mark Turgeon 452-256 (22nd season)\n\nNotable: Maryland hasn't won a regular season conference title since earning the ACC crown during the 2009-10 season under Gary Williams. But the Terrapins enter Wednesday's game against the Gophers with a 1 \u00bd-game lead over Michigan State for first place in the Big Ten standings ... Cowan leads Maryland with 16.4 points and 4.6 assists per game, but he was held to just 10 points on 1-for-4 shooting and fouled out in Sunday's loss at Ohio State ...The Terrapins are 9-2 all-time against the Gophers, but both losses have come against Pitino's teams. They fell 68-63 at the Barn as the No. 5 team in the nation during 2015-16 season ... Maryland ranks 10th in the NET entering Wednesday's game against the Gophers, who are 5-10 in Quadrant 1 games.","949":"Premier League: Manchester United Complete Derby Double Over Manchester City | Football News Ole Gunnar Solskjaer believes the bond between Manchester United players and fans is returning after completing a first Premier League derby double over Manchester City for 10 years at Old Trafford on Sunday. Anthony Martial and Scott McTominay took advantage of errors from City goalkeeper Ederson to keep United hot on the heels of Chelsea for a top-four finish, just three points behind the Blues. United have lived in City's shadow in recent years, but have beaten their city rivals three times this season and are now unbeaten in 10 games in all competitions.\n\n\"The desire, attitude, commitment, the connection between fans and players,\" said Solskjaer on what had pleased him most. \"What a day they've had today.\n\n\"It's a derby. The fans love it, the players love it. You can say it's only three points, but to beat a team like Manchester City with the problems we've had is fantastic.\"\n\nUnited move up to fifth in the table, which could be good enough to qualify for the Champions League next season if City's appeal against a ban from European football for the next two years is not successful at the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\n\nAnd on this display, City seem to already be concentrating on completing a treble of cup competitions this season.\n\nA seventh league defeat of the campaign for Pep Guardiola's men means Liverpool are now just a maximum of two wins away from claiming a first league title in 30 years.\n\nGuardiola insisted his side had played well, but midfielder Bernardo Silva described the performance and result as unacceptable.\n\n\"Not a good performance and not acceptable from us. A team like ours cannot lose this many games in the Premier League as we have lost this season,\" said Silva.\n\n\"The reality is that the pressure is not on the Premier League. We know our position is not changing a lot because we won't get to the title. I think we will be second to qualify for the Champions League, but it's a derby. It's important for our fans and it's not acceptable to lose 2-0.\"\n\nCity dominated possession early on, but badly missed the presence of the injured Kevin De Bruyne.\n\nThe visitors' defensive deficiencies that have allowed Liverpool to streak 25 points clear were also obvious as Daniel James and Martial fired too close to Ederson with big chances on the counter-attack.\n\nError-strewn Ederson\n\nBut it was an uncharacteristic error from the Brazilian that gifted United the lead.\n\nBruno Fernandes was the creator with a scooped free-kick to pick out Martial and his shot squeezed under Ederson's right hand at the near post.\n\nFred was then controversially booked for diving when he appeared to have been taken down inside the area by Nicolas Otamendi.\n\nUnited fans were frustrated VAR did not intervene on that occasion and when it did early in the second half, City were nearly the beneficiaries.\n\nSergio Aguero was flagged offside long before he fired past David de Gea, but the Argentine was only fractionally off when the move was reviewed.\n\nMoments later Ederson escaped gifting another goal as a routine backpass rolled under his foot and the former Benfica stopper needed to produce a last-ditch tackle on Martial to deny United breathing space.\n\nHowever, where United may have buckled earlier in the season, Solskjaer's men held firm as De Gea denied Phil Foden and Gabriel Jesus.\n\nMcTominay then sealed the three points deep into stoppage time when he strode onto a wayward throw by Ederson to steer the ball into an unguarded net.\n\n\"It's part of the game. He will recover and is an exceptional goalkeeper,\" said Guardiola of an error-strewn afternoon for Ederson.","950":"Prime Minister Narendra Modi Extends Wishes Ahead of India-Australia Women's T20 World Cup Final | Cricket News Prime Minister Narendra Modi has extended his best wishes to Indian and Australian teams ahead of the Women's Twenty20 World Cup final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday.

Prince has also written a new song titled \"Baltimore,\" the lyrics for which were revealed along with the news of the Mother's Day performance.\n\nIn a statement sent by his publicist, Prince said he hopes the concert will be \"a catalyst for pause and reflection following the outpouring of violence that has gripped Baltimore and areas throughout the U.S.\"\n\nTickets for the show go on sale Wednesday at 5 p.m. via LiveNation.com.

Well, actually it starts off showing five imposters on the couch claiming to be the Revolution, but then the real deals take their place in a huff, the kind of levity Prince himself was known for behind-the-scenes.\n\nThe video was shot when the band members met in private to mourn their mentor at the Cosmos bar in Loews Hotel in downtown Minneapolis on Sunday night, across the street from their old stomping ground First Avenue.\n\n\"We all love each other and are like a family, so it was good to be around each other,\" said keyboardist Fink, aka Dr. Fink.\n\nThere were nearly 100 people there -- mostly from Prince's '80s and '90s heyday -- including his first wife Mayte; his one-time girlfriend Susannah Melvoin of the group the Family (Wendy's twin sister); Sheila E.; other bandmembers from the NPG and 3rdEyeGirl lineups; Prince's siblings Tyka Nelson and Omarr Baker, and original Paisley Park managers Red White and Hawkeye Henriksen.\n\n\"Everybody knew everybody,\" said Robbie Paster, who was Prince's valet and personal assistant from 1984 to 1992. \"Wendy did a eulogy. Everybody told funny stories. Prince was a funny guy. He was the joker of jokers.\"\n\nThe Revolution members have not made any more formal declaration of their intentions beyond the video. \"Be there soon,\" is all that's promised in the video.\n\nThis Revolution lineup reunited in 2012 for an American Heart Association benefit concert at First Avenue after Bobby survived a heart attack. Guitarist Dez Dickerson, who was in the band before Melvoin, did not appear in the video but also took part in the 2012 reunion.\n\nIn an interview before that show in 2012, Coleman referred back to the band's only other reunion for a charity gig with Sheila E. in Los Angeles in 2003. \"It seemed so natural,\" Coleman said. \"We just counted off one of the songs. I think they're so ingrained in our bodies.\"\n\nWhen reached Tuesday, Bobby Z said, \"I am happy it's good news,\" but declined to comment further. Fink said the plans are still \"very much in the infant stage.\"\n\n\"It's going to take a while before we can say anything further,\" he said. \"We just wanted fans to know for now that it is in the works.\"","953":"Probing allosteric coupling in a constitutively open mutant of the ion channel KcsA using solid-state NMR This article requires a subscription to view the full text. If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nInactivation of potassium channels controls its mean open time and provides exquisite control over biological processes. In the highly conserved C-type inactivation process, opening of the activation gate causes subsequent inactivation. We test whether the open state of the channel simply has a poor ability to bind the K ion. Previously, activated and inactivated states were stabilized using truncations or a significant pH drop. Here, we use the H25R\/E118A constitutively open mutant of KcsA and also observe a large drop in potassium binding affinity. This provides strong evidence that channel opening causes an allosteric loss of ion affinity, and that the central feature of this universal channel inactivation process is loss of ion affinity at the selectivity filter.","954":"Problem Solved: Service technician mowed down my $600 mailbox and won't pay Q: I have a dispute with Optimum, our cable company. A service technician hit our mailbox with his truck a year ago. I reported the incident immediately and an inspector surveyed the damage a few days later. I've contacted the cable company over a dozen times and keep getting the runaround. I have bills for replacement, and they just won't pay.\n\nOptimum says a check was sent but I never received it. I'm told it was an outside service company that did the call that day, not an Optimum service person, and that's why it's difficult to resolve. The mailbox cost $600 plus $150 for installation. Can you help me?\n\nKarin Goldstein, Wayne, N.J.\n\nA: That's not what I would call optimum service! Someone ran over your mailbox and refused to pay. Someone should.\n\nIt doesn't matter if the person who did it was employed by Optimum, or was a contractor for Optimum. Tell me, does that excuse work the other way around? If you tell Optimum you can't pay its bill because your husband watches cable TV and he should pay, would that work? I think not.\n\nThis happens way too often. A company tells you that it can't do something because a third party, such as a contractor, was involved. But that shouldn't make a difference. You called Optimum for your cable TV needs, and someone representing Optimum showed up in your driveway and mowed down your mailbox. There's no question about who is responsible.\n\nThe inspector agreed that Optimum is liable.\n\nWhen this happens, it's important to keep a meticulous paper trail. Optimum provided you with a lengthy thread of emails (some barely written in English) but no actual copy of the report that acknowledged the damage. The report was the key to resolving your case. It detailed what, exactly, the Optimum representative had done.\n\nYou did a great job of recordkeeping. You had estimates for the new mailbox and installation -- and, of course, you kept those threads with Optimum. You even took a video of the damage and sent it to the company.\n\nI list the names, numbers and email addresses for the Optimum customer service executives on my consumer advocacy site, Elliott.org.\n\nThis case should have been resolved a year ago. Like I said, not optimum service here. This is one where the company should go back and retrain a few people in the ways of true customer service.\n\nI just don't understand how Optimum can allow this kind of case to drag on for more than a year. How can anyone justify that kind of delay?\n\nI contacted Optimum on your behalf. It contacted you and agreed to settle your claim.","955":"Productivity in isolation: Resource website inspired by Isaac Newton - WND Rebecca Hagelin touts effort to help us make best use of time in quarantine\n\nCOVID-19 didn't send Isaac Newton into quarantine, but the Bubonic Plague, otherwise known as the Black Death, did. While in isolation for some two years, this man of God and brilliant scientist made some of the most important discoveries known to mankind. Not one to let the threat of a deadly disease or the disruption it caused in his life to get him down, Newton's use of the quiet months still benefits us today. Specifically, Newton used his gifts of observation and reason to outline the Laws of Motion and Optics and to invent calculus. And the legendary falling apple that inspired him to contemplate what we now call gravity? The force was studied and named in the quiet of his family garden where Newton had sequestered himself.\n\nTwo ingenious friends have found inspiration in Sir Isaac Newton's use of solitude and are doing their part to help mankind too. KC Craichy (livingfuel.com), and Fred Markert, (ywamascend.com, churchofthehighlands.com) became concerned about the millions of people who feel the stress of isolation or are stuck in less than ideal home situations during America's time of quarantine. So, these two friends decided to create a website that they filled with free resources to help all of us use our home time productively. The website, www.theisaacnewtonproject.com, is already filled with scores of links to resources on everything from free online college courses, to a \u202a24\/7 prayer hotline, to sources for wholesome entertainment. Understanding that domestic violence is on the rise during this crisis, the site contains helplines and links to counseling ministries. Also featured are many of the most inspiring and powerful sermons by late Pastor Billy Graham including his final message, \"How to Have Peace in the Midst of Panic.\"\n\nThe many freebies on www.theisaacnewtonproject.com include homeschooling tips and apps, as well as ways to strengthen your marriage through the \"The Marriage Survival Guide\" podcasts. There's even a free book by retired NBA star Allan Houston, who now focuses on leadership, mentorship, and discipleship, called, \"The Fundamentals Of Life: Life In 3D.\" Need a break from the stress? Theisaacnewtonproject.com will bring a bit of laughter back into your life through the free streams by comedian Tim Hawkins.\n\nThe site also tells the inspiring story of Isaac Newton and how he allowed God to work in his life in the face of death. It was Sir Newton who said, \"This most beautiful system of the sun, planets, and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being. ...\n\n\"All variety of created objects which represent order and life in the universe could happen only by the willful reasoning of its original Creator, whom I call the 'Lord God.' ...\n\nTRENDING: Sheriff rebels against governor: 'We will not be setting up a police state'\n\n\"This Being governs all things, not as the soul of the world, but as Lord over all; and on account of His dominion He is wont to be called 'Lord God.' ...\n\n\"The supreme God exists necessarily, and by the same necessity He exists always and everywhere.\"\n\nWhen 2020 started, Americans were at each other's throats over politics. Today, decent Americans are no longer battling each other, but are fighting a common enemy that is no respecter of party affiliation. The illness and resulting economic crisis that threaten everyone have us needing each other the most at the same time that we are forced to isolate.

Wilder Foundation to a developer known for building luxury housing is sparking fears of gentrification and displacement in one of St. Paul's poorest neighborhoods.\n\nWilder, a St. Paul-based philanthropic organization that combats the effects of poverty, plans to sell the property to Alatus, which has proposed building predominantly market-rate apartments.\n\nBut in letters and at meetings over the past few months, local officials and Frogtown residents have prodded Alatus and Wilder to keep working to make more of the proposed building's 226 units affordable to neighborhood residents. They point out that Wilder cites providing housing and social services as part of its mission.\n\nThe purchase agreement between Wilder and Minneapolis-based Alatus, which was set to expire March 10, has been extended through May 9.\n\nCaty Royce, co-director of the Frogtown Neighborhood Association, said Wilder should renegotiate its deal with Alatus to demand that at least half the building is \"truly affordable.\"\n\n\"Really, it's on Wilder,\" she said. \"They could have required this as a condition of the sale. They didn't.\"\n\nWilder spokesman Andrew Brown said the organization granted Alatus an extension \"with the understanding that they will use this time to re-evaluate the project to address concerns about rent prices.\" Brown wouldn't say what Alatus has agreed to pay for the property.\n\nIn a statement, Sean Kershaw, vice president of Wilder Center for Communities, said: \"Wilder is aware of the need for affordable housing through the work we do every day. ... Funds from the sale of this property will support Wilder's mission to improve lives, which includes a continuum of programs that help hundreds of people find and maintain stable housing each year.\"\n\nThe closing date on the property will be on or before June 23.\n\nThe lots at 411 and 417 N. Lexington Parkway are a block south of the Green Line and near Wilder's headquarters at the northeastern edge of St. Paul's Union Park neighborhood. They have sat vacant for more than a decade.\n\nThe August announcement that Alatus hoped to begin construction by the first quarter of 2020 was welcome news to many. But, almost immediately, people raised concerns that no one from the neighborhood could afford to live in the units, and that those who are already living nearby might be forced out.\n\nRoyce said building an upscale project so close to adjoining low-income neighborhoods will incite other landlords to jack up their rents. She pointed to a recent study by the Center for Urban and Regional Affairs at the University of Minnesota that found as new market-rate apartments were built in Minneapolis, rents for \"lower-tier\" properties nearby increased 6 to 14%.\n\nSuch projects also drive up property taxes, she said, which can displace low-income homeowners.\n\n\"If you plop down luxury apartments, it will drive up rents and it will drive out people,\" Royce said. \"This is about bringing in people who don't live there now ... somebody is going to have to leave.\"\n\nAlatus has presented two options for what it wants to build: One is strictly market-rate apartments with no rent subsidies, which would help subsidize a community-based commercial tenant occupying 4,500 square feet. The other option would include six to 12 apartments that would be affordable for families earning 40% or 60% of the area median income, with a commercial tenant paying market rates.\n\nArea district council officials quickly weighed in, saying those proposals are inadequate.\n\nAccording to a report by the Minnesota Housing Partnership, Twin Cities-area median income in 2016 was more than $85,000 for a family of four. In St. Paul, it was just over $64,000. And in Frogtown, according to Minnesota Compass, median income is less than $40,000.\n\nAll of which means that even a handful of \"affordable\" units aren't really affordable for many families who live nearby, said Brandon Long, executive director of the Union Park District Council. To be truly affordable, he said, rents should be geared to families earning 30% of area median income.\n\n\"We expect rents to be affordable,\" Long said. \"But at 60% AMI, it may as well be at full price as far as that neighborhood is concerned.\"\n\nIn a letter to Wilder after the Alatus project was unveiled, the Frogtown Neighborhood Association asked that Wilder require at least half the units in the building be made affordable for families earning 30% of area median income.\n\nChris Osmundson, Alatus director of development, said that is unlikely to happen. Without outside funding to lower construction costs or subsidize rents, there is no way for developers to do that and still make money.\n\n\"As far as we can tell, there is not going to be any subsidy coming our way that will allow us to achieve anything close to that,\" he said.\n\nHe also said he doesn't agree with Royce's assertion that a single 226-unit building in an area with 10,000 units of housing will drive up rents and taxes and lead to gentrification.\n\n\"It's a bit more nuanced than that,\" he said.\n\nHousing costs in the area have been climbing for years -- in large part because of the Green Line light rail and its associated development along University Avenue. As a result, average rents along the Green Line have reached more than $1,700 a month. The Alatus project's rents will be about $200 a month less, he said. Alatus continues to work with city officials to find funding to help subsidize the project -- such as obtaining a $1.25 million grant from the Metropolitan Council to encourage transit-oriented development.\n\nWhile housing is needed for low-income families, St. Paul needs more housing of all types -- market-rate included, Osmundson said.\n\nThe $60 million project would increase taxes for the property from about $100,000 a year now to about $900,000, he said.\n\n\"It's hard to satisfy everyone here,\" he said. \"But there are plenty of residents who have come to our community meetings who just don't want to see a snow pile there anymore.\"\n\nSt. Paul City Council Member Dai Thao, who represents the area, called for the Wilder Foundation to press Alatus for more affordable housing.\n\n\"If you do [only] market-rate there, it will have a negative impact. I would support more of a mixed use there,\" he said. \"Wilder has a responsibility. Their vision is to help people who are vulnerable, but Wilder has said that whoever the developer is, affordable housing is up to them. That's very disappointing.\"","959":"Prosecutors announce charges in 11-year-old unsolved murder of woman abducted from Bloomington women's shelter Cedrick Marks is also suspected in the deaths of his ex-girlfriend and another man and remains in a Texas jail.\n\nA man suspected of killing two people in Texas has been charged in a previously unsolved slaying of a woman who was abducted from a Bloomington domestic violence shelter 11 years ago, authorities said Monday.\n\nHennepin County prosecutors on Monday filed a second-degree murder charge against Cedrick Marks, 45, of Killeen, Texas, in the 2009 death of April Pease, who was the mother of one of his children.\n\nMarks is also suspected in the deaths of his ex-girlfriend and another man and remains in a Texas jail in lieu of $2 million bbail in that case.\n\nProsecutors said that the case against Marks dates back to shortly after Pease disappeared on March 16, 2009. A criminal complaint filed in district court says that Bloomington detectives flew to Washington state in January to interview her mother, who told them that Marks was abusive even after her daughter left him. She said he managed to find her at a women's shelter in Seattle, where she was seeking treatment for drug addiction.\n\nThe complaint said that Bloomington investigators also spoke to one of Marks' wives and one of his girlfriends, Kellee Sorensen, who confessed to helping him find Pease by calling airlines and shelters around the country and posing as her to try to figure out where she was.\n\nSorensen, 34, of Lynden, Wash., was also charged Monday with second-degree murder for allegedly helping Marks abduct Pease in Minnesota.\n\nAfter that episode, Pease was transferred to another shelter in Bloomington, authorities said. But Marks managed to track her down again, with Sorensen's help, and showed up at the shelter one day, attacking Pease while she was outside and forcing her into his car, according to the complaint.\n\nPease was with her and Marks' 4-year-old son at the time. The charges against Sorensen said she told police that Marks punched Pease. Sorensen grabbed the boy and returned him to the shelter, the charges said.\n\nSorensen told detectives that as the three of them drove south on I-35, Pease was yelling for help and screaming until she fell asleep, the complaint against Marks said.\n\nEventually, Marks turned onto a gravel road and stopped beside an abandoned shack, telling Sorensen to stay in the car. He then dragged Pease outside and behind the shack, where he killed her as she begged for her life, authorities said. Marks was crying as he walked back to the car, and he allegedly told Sorensen that he had killed Pease and removed her hands and teeth to prevent the possibility of identification.\n\nIt's unclear from the complaint whether her body was ever discovered, but one of Marks' wives told police that she believed Pease's body was buried somewhere in North Dakota or South Dakota.\n\nIn the Texas case, Marks was charged last year in the deaths of an ex-girlfriend, Jenna Scott, and a friend of hers, Michael Swearingin. The pair disappeared from Scott's Texas home on Jan. 4, 2019. Their bodies were later found in a shallow grave in eastern Oklahoma. Marks was arrested in Michigan, but later escaped and was rearrested after a nine-hour manhunt involving multiple law enforcement agencies, according to local news reports.\n\nLike Pease, Scott alleged in a protective order that Marks was abusive throughout their relationship and had choked her unconscious more than once, according to authorities.\n\nA district attorney in Bell County, Texas, said in a TV interview last year that he intends to seek the death penalty against Marks, a former mixed martial arts (MMA) fighter who went by the nickname \"Spider-Man.\"\n\nBloomington authorities have long suspected Marks was involved in Pease's disappearance.\n\nAfter his arrest in Texas last year, Bloomington police said in an interview with the Associated Press that he remained a person of interest in the Pease case. Around the same time, Pease's mother, Dottie Pease, told a Seattle area TV station that she had believed her daughter might have had a drug relapse, but that given the pending case against Marks she thought it was possible that he might have had something to do with her daughter's disappearance.\n\nMarks and Pease were involved in a fierce custody dispute in Washington state, and Pease, who had a drug problem, went to live in a Bloomington women's shelter because she said she was afraid of Marks. After her disappearance, Marks got custody of their son.\n\nSeveral months before the Bloomington kidnapping, Marks apparently posted a rambling message in an online forum detailing the couple's custody battle over their son.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.","960":"Psychics Who Hear Voices Could Be On to Something The ways some \"healthy voice hearers\" cope might be able to help people with psychotic disorders.\n\nLink Copied\n\nJessica Dorner was lying in bed at her cousin's house when her grandmother, a \"pushy lady\" in an apron who had been dead for several years, appeared in front of her. \"I know you can see me,\" Jessica heard her say, \"and you need to do something about it.\"\n\nIt was a lonely time in Jessica's life. She was living away from home for the first time, and she thinks her grandmother was drawn by some sense of that. She eventually told her parents what happened, and according to her they were concerned, but not overly panicked. \"My parents are probably the least judgmental people I know,\" she said.\n\nAs Jessica tells it, over the next two years, spirits visited her every now and again. Her brother-in-law's deceased father began forming before her, ghostlike, just as her grandmother did. And while the experiences were intense and at times made her feel \"crazy,\" she said, they were infrequent, and insists that they were never a real source of suffering.\n\nJessica later moved back home and got a job as a pharmacy technician, all the while figuring out how to cope with what was happening to her. At a co-worker's suggestion, she went to the Healing in Harmony center in Connecticut. In 2013, she says, she enrolled in classes there that taught her to use her \"gift.\" A self-described psychic medium, Jessica tells me she hears voices that other people do not (in addition to sometimes seeing people others do not see), at varying intensity, and mostly through her right ear.\n\nMeeting others like her at the center gave Jessica a sense of relief. \"Just being around people who are going through similar things -- that helps a lot, because I could talk to anybody about those things and not feel like I was crazy,\" she said.\n\nIt was through a friend from the center that Jessica ended up in the lab of Philip Corlett and Albert Powers, a psychologist and a psychiatrist at Yale. In a study published last fall in Schizophrenia Bulletin, Powers and Corlett compared self-described psychics with people diagnosed with a psychotic disorder who experience auditory hallucinations.\n\n\"A lot of the time, if someone says they hear voices, you immediately jump to psychotic illness, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia,\" Corlett said. But research suggests hearing voices is not all that uncommon. A survey from 1991 -- the largest of its kind since -- found that 10 to 15 percent of people in the U.S. experienced sensory hallucinations of some sort within their lifetime. And other research, as well as growing advocacy movements, suggest hearing voices isn't always a sign of psychological distress.\n\nThe researchers at Yale were looking for a group of people who hear voices at least once a day, and had never before interacted with the mental-health-care system. They wanted to understand, as Corlett put it, those who do not suffer when \"the mind deviates from consensual reality.\"\n\nWhat Corlett calls consensual reality -- the \"normative shared experience we all agree on\" -- is probably not something you spend too much time thinking about. But you know when it's being violated. The sky is blue, the sun is hot, and as Corlett points out, most would generally agree that people don't receive extrasensory messages from one another.\n\nJessica was quite frank with me about the way some people may view her. \"We know these experiences are weird and they're seen as weird,\" she said. \"You just can't go into a room and say 'Hey, I'm a psychic medium' and people are gonna accept you.\"\n\nFiner points of what counts as reality can change over time, and vary based on geography or culture. For centuries people walked the earth believing the sun orbited around them, which today would be considered unreasonable. Who decides that consensus, and where along its boundaries voice hearers fall, depends on a wide range of circumstances.\n\nThe anthropologist Tanya Luhrmann, who has studied voice hearing in psychiatric and religious contexts, has written that \"historical and cultural conditions ... affect significantly the way mental anguish is internally experienced and socially expressed.\" Noting that there is no question psychiatric distress and schizophrenia are \"real\" phenomena that call for treatment, Luhrmann adds that \"the way a culture interprets symptoms may affect an ill person's prognosis.\" Every psychiatrist I spoke to shared the belief that unusual behavior should only enter into the realm of diagnosis when it causes suffering.\n\nOn the other hand, Luhrmann tells me \"it's a terribly romantic idea\" to overinterpret the effects of culture. To say, for instance, that \"anybody who would be identified with schizophrenia in our culture would be a shaman in Ecuador\" is, in her mind, a clear mistake: \"Flagrant psychosis\" exists in some form in every culture where anthropologists have looked.\n\nIn the past decade, researchers have taken a greater interest in the experience of hearing voices outside the context of psychological distress. In his book The Voices Within, the psychologist Charles Fernyhough traces the way thoughts and external voices have been understood by science and society throughout time.*\n\nReflecting on Fernyhough's book, Jerome Groopman notes that in the early parts of the Bible, the voice of God gave direct commands to Adam, Abraham, and Noah. It spoke to Moses through the Burning Bush, going by the Book of Esther, making itself known again to the apostle Paul in the New Testament. Socrates, who wrote nothing down, heard a \"sign\" from childhood. The voices of three saints guided Joan of Arc as she rebelled against the English. Groopman cites Martin Luther King, Jr.'s autobiography, in which he describes \"the quiet assurance of an inner voice\" telling him to \"stand up for righteousness.\"\n\nThe social context in which these people lived can impact how they're seen. It's impossible to say how the prophet Ezekiel was understood within his cultural moment. But in most places today, if a person claimed -- as Ezekiel does -- that he ate a scroll because the Lord commanded him to do so, some eyebrows might be raised. In a community where a personal, verbal relationship with God is normal, the reception may be different.\n\nPowers and Corlett's work orbits the idea that schizophrenia is, as Powers put it, an \"outmoded\" label that describes a cluster of different symptoms rather than a single unified condition, he says.\n\n\"Goodness knows what psychosis actually is,\" Luhrmann said. \"There are clearly different kinds of events in the domain we call psychosis,\" and when it comes to the relationship between voice hearing and psychosis, she says, \"there's so much we don't understand.\"\n\nMany now antiquated psychiatric diagnoses reified fear, misunderstanding, or prejudice toward people at society's margins. At the time of the women's suffrage movement in London, hysteria was leveled as a charge against women who broke social codes. A Mississippi psychiatrist in the 19th century proposed that slaves who attempted escape suffered from \"drapetomania.\" And until 1973, homosexuality was considered a disease of the mind rather than an accepted way of being in the United States -- and was only fully removed from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders in 1987.\n\nIn his book Hallucinations, the late Oliver Sacks details a controversial experiment in which eight participants showed up at hospitals throughout the U.S. in the early '70s and complained only of \"hearing voices.\" All of them were immediately diagnosed with a psychotic disorder and hospitalized for two months, despite reporting no other medical symptoms, family history, or signs of personal distress. The single symptom, Sacks writes, was seen as cause enough.\n\nPeople with psychiatric disorders do hear auditory hallucinations in relatively high numbers. According to Ann Shinn, a psychiatrist at Harvard Medical School and McLean Hospital, 70 to 75 percent of people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and between one-third and one-tenth of people with bipolar disorder report hearing voices at some point in their life.\n\nIn the case of voice hearing, culture may also play a role in helping people cope. One study conducted by Luhrmann, the anthropologist, found that compared to their American counterparts, voice-hearing people diagnosed with schizophrenia in more collectivist cultures were more likely to perceive their voices as helpful and friendly, sometimes even resembling members of their friends and family. She adds that people who meet criteria for schizophrenia in India have better outcomes than their U.S. counterparts. She suspects this is because of \"the negative salience\" a diagnosis of schizophrenia holds in the U.S., as well as the greater rates of homelessness among people with schizophrenia in America.\n\nThe influence of social context was part of what motivated Corlett and Powers: The two were interested in whether the support of a social group can help them understand where disorder and difference intersect. When they set out to design their study, they needed an otherwise healthy group of people who hear voices on a regular basis, and whose experiences are accepted in their social group.\n\nNext, they needed to find some psychics. Corlett told me he got the idea to reach out to a Connecticut-based organization for psychics after noticing the ads for psychics and tarot-card readers on his daily bus route. When the two interviewed those participants, they noticed something striking: The psychics described hearing hearing voices of similar volumes, frequencies, and timbres as the patients. Powers and Corlett took this to mean that the psychics were actually hearing something. The two also vetted their participants with the same techniques that forensic psychiatrists use to determine whether a person is pretending to experience psychiatric symptoms, giving them more reason to believe what they were told.\n\nCompared to their diagnosed counterparts, more of the psychics described the voices as a force that \"positively affects safety.\" And all of the psychics attributed the voices to a \"god or other spiritual being.\" The patients, meanwhile, were more likely to consider their voices a torment caused by a faulty process in their brain. Many of them described the voices as \"bothersome,\" and also claimed that the first time they told anyone what they were hearing, they received a negative response.\n\nJust like Jessica, the psychics were more likely to say that they received a positive reaction the first time they spoke about their experience. Jessica's mother, Lena, told me she maintained a supportive, nonjudgmental attitude toward her daughter's accounts, just as she did when her other daughter converted to Scientology. She waited for Jessica to bring them up and discussed them with an open mind. She says she was happy Jessica found the center, adding that her only concern was that Jessica's experiences did sometimes seem to be distressing her and leaving her \"drained.\"\n\nWhen Jessica tells me about the people and things she hears, she describes a range of experiences rather than one consistent phenomenon. Her most meaningful episodes of voice hearing are those like the visits she had from her grandmother and her brother-in-law's father. But she also describes things like hearing the number a friend is thinking, and the persistent and vivid presence of a childhood imaginary friend (her mother told me Jessica demanded the table be set for him at every meal). To Jessica, these experiences differ in degree rather than kind from the ghosts of the dead who appear in front of her with persistent messages for her and for others. Though these might not all fit into the popular conception of a psychic, she understands them to exist along that same continuum.\n\nIn his book, Fernyhough describes a series of experiments meant to provide evidence for the connection between inner speech and hearing voices. In one, participants were played recordings of other people's speech alongside recordings of their own, disguised and distorted, and told to mark whether the voice was their own or someone else's. Those who experienced hallucinations were more likely to misidentify their own altered voices. A much older experiment found a kind of unconscious ventriloquism among a group of people with schizophrenia: When participants began to hear voices, researchers noted \"an increase in tiny movements in the muscles associated with vocalization.\" The voices they heard came, in some sense, from their own throats.\n\nThese experiments suggest that auditory hallucinations are the result of the mind failing to brand its actions as its own. Watching what the brain does during these hallucinations may clarify how that works, and what differences in the brain create these experiences.\n\n\"When your brain signals to generate a movement,\" Shinn, the psychiatrist at Harvard, told me, \"there is a parallel signal [known as an efference copy] that basically says 'this is mine, it's not coming from outside.'\" This helps creates the sense of where a person is in space, that their hand belongs to them and it is moving from point A to B. In this way, the body labels its motions, and a possible parallel may exist for speech and thought. When people hear voices, they may be hearing 'unmarked' thoughts they do not recognize as their own.\n\nBeyond that, Shinn told me, what is understood about the experiences of people who hear voices is limited. She sees Corlett and Powers's study as part of a growing interest in the lives of \"healthy voice hearers\" -- an interest spurred, in part, by the Hearing Voices Movement. A network of advocacy groups, the Hearing Voices Movement presents an alternative to the medical approach based on the belief that the content of a person's voices can reflect the hearer's mental and emotional state. The groups encourage an approach in which, with the help of a facilitator or counselor, hearers listen to, speak back to, and negotiate with the messages they hear in hopes of learning to cope.\n\nThe hearing-voices advocate Eleanor Longden has said she considers her voices \"a source of insight into solvable emotional problems\" rooted in trauma rather than \"an aberrant symptom of schizophrenia.\" As Longden tells it, that's how her own experiences with voices were understood when she first sought treatment for anxiety. Her psychiatrist told her how limited her life would be by her voices, she says, and the voices grew more adversarial.\n\nMany mental-health-care providers -- Shinn, Corlett, and Powers included -- seem receptive to the Hearing Voices Movement's critiques, including an overemphasis on medication and an imperative for patient-focused treatment. Shinn credits the network with encouraging an approach that treats voice hearing as more than a checklist item adding up to a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and helping to reduce the stigma attached the experience of voice hearing.\n\nBut \"there are certainly a lot of people for whom that will not be enough,\" she says. For some patients, voices can be impossible to reason with, and the burden of other symptoms of psychosis -- disordered thought, delusions, the inability to feel pleasure -- can be too great. And Powers and Corlett expressed concerns that the Hearing Voices Network may promote a false divide: the idea that the voices' perceived roots in trauma -- rather than some accident of biology -- means hearers should avoid medication. Biology and experience, they say, can't be so neatly separated. (Longden has written that \"many people find medication helpful,\" and that the International Hearing Voice Network advocates for \"informed choice.\")\n\nWhile Powers and Corlett don't believe the psychics and patients are experiencing the exact same thing, the two are cautiously hopeful that about a potential lesson in the greatest difference between those groups: the ability to control the voices they hear, which is something the psychics, including Jessica, showed in greater number than their counterparts. \"When I'm in certain situations, I'm not open,\" Jessica said. For instance, when she's at work, the voices \"can come in,\" she says, they \"can hang out, but I'm not gonna talk right now. ... I still have to live this human life.\"\n\nWhile learning control was a major part of Jessica's experience, so was learning to summon the voices she heard. Before training as a medium, she heard voices sporadically, she says, and began to hear them every day only after intentionally practicing at the center. Powers and Corlett acknowledge this general trend in their study: The psychics they spoke tended to seek out and cultivate the voice-hearing experiences.\n\nIn her work, Luhrmann has come across groups of people who -- unlike Jessica -- hear voices only as a result of practice. She gives the example of tulpamancers: people who create tulpas, which are believed to be other beings or personalities that co-exist along inside a person's mind along with their own. \"Somebody in that community estimated to me that one-fifth of the community had frequent voice hearing experiences with their tulpas, that their tulpas talked in a way that was auditory or quasi auditory,\" Luhrmann said, a practice that she was told takes two hours a day to develop.\"That's connected to work. Psychosis is not connected to effort. It happens to people.\"\n\nLongden, the Hearing Voices Network advocate, describes how she later learned to extract metaphorical meaning from the sometimes disturbing messages the voices had for her. Once when the voices warned her not to leave the house, she thanked them for making her aware that she was feeling unsafe, and firmly reassured the voices -- and by extension, herself -- that they had nothing to fear.\n\nThough Jessica has a different understanding of her voices' source, it's hard not to hear echoes of Longden's account when she speaks about the sense of control she's developed. Longden talks to the voices as aspects of herself that call for a response, while Jessica addresses them as visitors who need to learn the rules.\n\nInstead of tying these experiences to a discrete diagnosis, Powers and Corlett imagine a new kind of frame for voice hearing. Drawing a parallel with Autism Spectrum Disorder, the two are interested in the extent to which the psychics they saw \"might occupy the extreme end of a continuum\" of people who hear voices. \"Much of what we perceive and believe about the world is based on our expectations and our beliefs,\" Corlett said. \"We can see hallucinations as an exaggeration of that process, and the psychics as a sort of way-station on that continuum, and slowly but surely we can creep towards a better understanding of the clinical case and therefore better treatment. We haven't had new treatment mechanisms in schizophrenia for many years now.\"\n\nThe two freely admit the gaps between their ambitions and what they know so far. The study is preliminary, qualitative work -- a follow-up brain-imaging study is in the works -- and they did only interview a small number of people. Psychics, they say, are not so easy to come by.\n\nLuhrmann speculates that most of the psychics are experiencing something separate from psychosis: \"I think it's also true that there are people who have psychosis who manage it such that they don't fall ill and avoid this stigma and who really function effectively.\" This difference aside, she says, \"it may still be possible to learn from people who have more control over their voices. .... to think about how to teach people.\"\n\nAt least as subtext, Powers and Corlett's study might suggest a kind of chicken-or-egg question: Were the psychics insulated from suffering because they were socialized to accept and cope with their voices, and were the psychotic patients suffering because they weren't? The better question is: to what extent were the two groups experiencing the same thing?\n\nShinn believes the fact that far fewer diagnosed participants were employed at the time of the study (25 percent, versus 83 percent of the psychics), and that the diagnosed participants experienced more symptoms of psychosis, suggests that they were suffering beyond the point of being useful comparisons. She thinks, rather, that a \"constellation\" of symptoms -- not just auditory hallucinations or the stigma associated with auditory hallucinations -- explain the difference in functionality. \"The Powers study provides interesting results with potentially helpful clinical implications,\" she added, \"but they compare very different groups.\"\n\nShinn, Powers, and Corlett are all adamant that people who hear voices and experience psychological distress shouldn't turn away from conventional psychiatric treatment, and that a \"symptom\" -- in this case, voice hearing -- only calls for clinical attention if it is a cause of suffering. But for those who are distressed, the level of understanding of their experience and the treatments available to them are still lacking. As Powers notes, many of psychiatry's more effective drug treatments were developed by accident. Shinn likens the current body of knowledge of schizophrenia to a group of people describing different parts of an elephant while looking through a high-power lens: There are robust bodies of work on the trunk, the tail, and the ear, but no clear picture of the entire animal.\n\nShinn's all too aware of the ways in which the diagnosis can overshadow the patient. \"There have been psychiatrists,\" she says, \"who will tell a patient: You have a diagnosis of schizophrenia and you need to modify or adjust your goals in life, forget grad school, forget that Wall Street career,\" Shinn said. \"And that absolutely can be compounding and impairing. I don't disagree that that's a problem.\"\n\nAs Luhrmann put it: \"Are those cultural judgments the cause of the illness? Absolutely not. Do those cultural judgments make it worse? Probably.\"\n\nJessica doesn't live near the center anymore. While she'd love to find fulltime work as a medium, she says, she's focusing on her graduate studies to become a dietitian for now.\n\nStill, she's grateful for the community she found at the center, she says, and for the help they gave her. \"I cannot imagine having no control over this,\" she told me. \"I don't know, if I never went to the center, maybe I'd be diagnosed with schizophrenia.\"\n\n* This article originally stated that Charles Fernyhough hears voices himself.

(AP) -- Virginia lawmakers passed a budget earlier this month that would give teachers and state employees raises and bonuses -- a win for public sector workers who said they'd suffered too many years of stagnant pay since the Great Recession.\n\nThe total cost of the pay increases was about $600 million over the next two years, which was one of several big ticket new spending lawmakers were able to approve thanks to a stronger-than-expected economy.\n\nTwo weeks later, those pay boosts are in serious jeopardy as state officials scramble to figure out just how bad the conoravirus' impact will be on the state budget.\n\nThe new Democratic majority at the legislature has previously promised to make increasing teacher pay a top priority. State officials said the pay raises could be cut but they were not ready to say for sure.\n\n\"That is definitely on the list but we haven't made any decisions yet,\" said Democratic Sen. Janet Howell, chairwoman of the Senate Finance Committee.\n\nThe proposed pay increases included the state's share of a 2% a year increase for teacher pay for the next two years and a 3% bonus in fiscal 2021 and a 3% raise the following year for state employees.\n\nChristine Melendez, a high school Spanish teacher in Chesterfield County, said she hopes lawmakers can find a way to keep those pay increases. She said losing the proposed raises would be a \"slap in the face\" to teachers who are currently trying to improvise new online lesson plans after Gov. Ralph Northam ordered schools closed for the school year.\n\nPainful budget shortfalls due to the Great Recession led to several years without any across-the-board increases in public sector pay in Virginia. The average salary of $52,000 for Virginia teachers puts the state at 31st in the country, according to a recent report by the legislature. In 2010, Virginia's average teacher pay -- $45,000 -- was 25th in the country.\n\nMelendez said teachers are becoming better organized and more outspoken in search of higher pay, and efforts to cut the proposed raises will be met with pushback.\n\n\"We can only take so much,\" she said.\n\nNortham will likely make significant changes to the proposed budget before it goes to lawmakers for a final vote. The legislature is set to reconvene in late April, though that may be altered because of the virus.\n\nSecretary of Finance Aubrey Layne recently told lawmakers to brace for at least $1 billion in fewer revenues in the next fiscal year than the state had been expecting, but said the real amount could be much more. He and other state officials said there are just too many uncertainties around the coronovirus' impact, including what help the federal government will ultimately provide, to make accurate predictions about what the damage will be and where the budget will have to be slashed.\n\n\"There's going to be big cuts, I just don't know how much. I really don't,\" Layne said.\n\nVirginia's unemployment numbers have spiked as the state has ordered restaurants and other businesses to close or severely limit their operations for at least a month.\n\nTax revenues of all kind are certain to take a hit, including individual income taxes, which make up about 70% of the state's general fund revenues. Meanwhile, the cost of social services, like Medicaid, will rise as more people turn to the state for help.\n\nA booming stock market had boosted state tax revenues and helped give lawmakers plenty of new money to spend during the most recent budget writing process. New spending that lawmakers will have to reconsider includes $80 million to freeze in-state tuition at public universities, $34 million to provide dental services to adults on Medicaid, and about $90 million to expand public preschool offerings.\n\nLawmakers have budgeted $2 billion in reserves which they hope will cushion the blow. For context, the state's projected general fund revenues are about $25 billion a year.\n\n-- -- --\n\nFollow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https:\/\/apnews.com\/VirusOutbreak and https:\/\/apnews.com\/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.\n\nCopyright 2020 Associated Press.

He got a four-year, $57.5 million extension, then after the Rams curiously backed off his workload over a knee issue that has still never been fully explained, Gurley wasn't worth the money anymore. He was cut, and scooped up by the Atlanta Falcons on a one-year, $6 million deal.\n\nEasy, right? Maybe not. The Rams wouldn't say it was a salary-cap related move.\n\nRams say cutting Todd Gurley not a cap issue\n\nRams coach Sean McVay and general manager Les Snead discussed the decision to cut Gurley on Monday. And while it is obvious the move was related to money, the Rams wouldn't say it.\n\n\"In this case, I don't think it's a salary cap issue, but in the puzzle, like I said in putting together your short-term and long-term vision of trying to consistently contend what you pay players comes into play, obviously producing comes into play,\" Snead said, according to ESPN's Lindsey Thiry.\n\nThere are a lot of words tossed together there, but Snead made it sound like production and not the salary cap was the biggest reason Gurley is no longer a Ram.\n\nIt's true that the Rams will see only a $5.5 million cap savings after June 1, because Gurley was designated a post-June 1 cut and the dead cap hit can be spread out between two seasons. A savings of $5.5 million won't buy much that late in the offseason. Gurley left behind $20.15 million in dead money on the salary cap, according to NFL.com's Tom Pelissero, but the team avoided paying $10.5 million in salary and bonuses that were about to be guaranteed.\n\nThat large sum was behind the move. Though the Rams curiously wouldn't explain their motivation behind the move in a clearer way.\n\nGurley's production had dropped\n\nGurley's production did drop in 2019. His 3.8 yards per carry was down dramatically from his average of 4.9 in 2018. His yards per reception was a career-worst 6.7, well off his career-best mark of 12.3 in 2017.\n\nGurley wasn't terrible, just not at his typical level. And the Rams decided to move on. Snead said \"we all wish the partnership could have lasted longer.\"\n\n\"A lot of the decisions we make aren't exclusively about a player, but you're talking about how to fit a big puzzle together with your team,\" McVay said. \"These are conversations that require a lot of different directions and kind of projections based on where we're at, where we want to be... but there certainly were a lot of things that went into the discussion and ultimately the decision to make that move.\"\n\nWhether Malcolm Brown and Darrell Henderson, Gurley's backups in 2019, can be more productive behind a decaying offensive line this season remains to be seen. But the Rams say the decision to cut Gurley was more complicated than just saving some money on the cap.","967":"Ranger Betty Soskin, 93, on the Rosie the Riveter national park, California The oldest national park ranger in the US tells us why she's proud of the second world war home front park in Richmond, just across the bay from San Francisco\n\nI settled in the greater Bay Area as a six-year-old in 1927. When I graduated from high school in 1938, my two opportunities for employment were working in agriculture or being a domestic servant. At that time, labour unions weren't racially integrated and, during the war, I worked as a clerk for the segregated boilermakers' union.\n\nRosie the Riveter national park in Richmond, over the bay from San Francisco, tells the story of America's home front in the second world war. It takes in scattered sites such as the Kaiser Shipyards and the Ford assembly plant and preserves the legacy not only of the women who entered non-traditional labour for the first time, but of all those who served.\n\nThe park is creating a common history. Richmond was a town of 23,000 people in 1942 and a city of 130,000 by the war's end, so the city is a collection of strangers looking for an identity. The park is helping to do that.\n\nIt's an indication of how much social change has occurred in this country, that 70 years on from working in that union hall, after raising four children and outliving a couple of husbands, I could return to Richmond as a field representative for the state of California. In those intervening years, the country had evolved.\n\nThe National Park Service is America's greatest gift to itself. Movie director Ken Burns said that, and I think it's true. Having places where America can revisit its past and move together to a more compassionate future is a gift - and the Rosie the Riveter park is one of those places.\n\nOne of the most important sites is the Rosie memorial. It was designed by two San Franciscan artists: Cheryl Barton and Susan Schwartzenberg. It's an abstraction of a part of a ship, and there's a timeline of the story of the home front in one direction and, in the other, quotes from the women - Rosies - whose oral histories we have.\n\nAs a woman of colour, my history with the park is a bit different. My experience was not as a Rosie the Riveter; that tended to be a white woman's story. Black women had been working outside their homes ever since slavery.\n\nI've been involved with the park since it opened. I was the only person of colour at the meeting held in 2000 to flesh out its identity, and the only one who could look at the scattered sites and point out that most of them were also sites of racial segregation. There was no grand conspiracy to leave [black] history out - it was just that no one else in that room had any reason to remember it.\n\nI love showing visitors a film about the history of Richmond. When it ends, I get to do a commentary, bringing that history into the future. When the park was being set up, the exhibit designers and film makers really did listen to those of us who lived and worked here. I feel very much a part of its creation.\n\nOne of my favourite places is the Ford assembly plant. The vista from that place takes in Oakland and Angel Island, Alcatraz and San Francisco, and all of the nine counties that touch the bay. Sitting on the shoreline, looking at the Bay Area, is one of my favourite things, and I take a few moments out of every day to do that.\n\nWhatever I do today has to be done right because I don't have time to do it over again. I'm at place where I now have full respect for conflicting truths - all of us live a different reality. And the park that I work in also appreciates those truths.\n\nThere's a life-size mural in the visitor centre depicting MacDonald Avenue, the main street that runs through Richmond, taken on 6 December 1941, the day before the dropping of the bombs on Pearl Harbor. We have visitors from all over the world, and most stop at that mural.\n\nI'm 93, in my 10th decade. If your brain is still intact at this age, you have an incredible perspective - it's a wonderful time to be living.","968":"Ranji Trophy Final Pitch \"Very Poor\", BCCI Should Look Into It: Bengal Coach Arun Lal | Cricket News Bengal coach Arun Lal on Monday rated the pitch for their Ranji Trophy final against Saurashtra as \"very poor\" and said the BCCI should probe how such a sub-standard surface was prepared for the big game. Far too many balls kept low on the opening day, especially in the final session, as Saurashtra reached 206 for five at close of play. \"Very poor wicket. The board has to look into things like these. The ball is not coming up. This is not good for cricket. The ball is not getting off, it is dusting, reversing. Very poor,\" Lal, who played 16 Tests and 13 ODIs for India, said after the day's play.\n\nThe 64-year-old felt the curator did not do his job when asked if the final should have been held at a neutral venue.\n\n\"No, net necessarily (on neutral venue). You have got neutral curators. The board should look into it. Send your curator 15 days before the game. Even the curator has not done a good job.\"\n\nAsked if he would speak to BCCI boss Sourav Ganguly on the matter, Lal said: \"That is not my job. They should look into it on their own.\"\n\nThe potent Bengal pace attack targeted the stumps in the final session with the ball keeping low, getting three wickets in return. The visitors got two in the afternoon session and none in the morning.\n\n\"We had to attack the batsman (in third session). You have to contain runs, like I said it is a poor wicket. Medium pacer is bowling with one slip and there is no chance of ball carrying it to slips. It would be a disgrace if the ball starts rolling through on day three,\" said Lal.\n\nTalking about the game, Lal said there is a long way to go and he is satisfied after day one.\n\n\"Yes, I am. This is a long game. 15 sessions have to be played, we have played three. We will fight till the end whatever the result. We don't focus on the result. We focus on what we do best. If we keep them to under 300 in the first innings, I will be happy.\"\n\nOn Sudip Kumar Gharami making his first-class debut in a big final, Lal added: \"He is a young boy and immensely talented who is playing U-23 for Bengal. Someone else made his debut in the Ranji final and went on to captain India successfully. May be he would emulate him (referring to Ganguly).\"","969":"Ranji Trophy Final: Akash Deep Stars As Saurashtra End Day 1 At 206\/5 | Cricket News Young pacer Akash Deep took three wickets as Bengal kept Saurashtra in check as they ended Day 1 at 206\/5 in the final of the Ranji Trophy in Rajkot on Monday. The home team is also fretting over Cheteshwar Pujara's health as the India Test batsman looked under the weather before retiring hurt. Akash Deep, 23, returned the day's best figures of 3\/41 while pace spearhead Ishan Porel (1\/37) and left-arm spinner Shahbaz Ahmed (1\/56) picked up one wicket each. Mukesh Kumar, who was the hero of Bengal's semifinal win over Karnataka at the Eden Gardens, remained wicketless after the first day's play.\n\nFor Saurashtra, Avi Barot (54) and Vishvaraj Jadeja (54) struck half centuries. Arpit Vasavada remained not out on 29 from 94 deliveries with Chetan Sakariya getting dismissed off the final ball of the day.\n\nThe biggest cause of concern for the home side was Pujara, joining his state side for the final, ambling off towards the dressing room after feeling unwell late into the third session.\n\nPujara pushed himself down to No.6 from his usual No.3 position after Saurashtra elected to bat first. The Jaydev Unadkat-led side were 182\/4 when Pujara walked out to bat and was looking solid on five from 24 balls. But as his stay at the crease progressed, the 32-year-old looked uneasy and under the weather before eventually failing to continue.\n\nJust back from New Zealand where India lost the Test series 0-2, Pujara walked back to the dressing room looking dazed.\n\nIt was a blow for the home team who were struggling after the in-form Bengal pacers came back to take four wickets in the second and third session to blunt Saurashtra's good start.\n\nThe opening pair of Harvik Desai (38) and wicketkeeper Barot shared a 82-run stand before Shahbaz had Desai caught at silly point by substitute Abhishek Raman.\n\nBarot followed suit soon after with India Test wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha, also joining the Bengal team for the final, taking a catch off Akash Deep.\n\nVishvaraj and Vasavada looked good for a long partnership, but Akash Deep came up with a beauty to rattle the former's stumps.\n\nIn-form Sheldon Jackson (14) was trapped in front by Porel as Saurashtra suddenly found themselves in a spot of bother.\n\nPujara and Vasavada also looked good but once Pujara left the field, it was downhill for the hosts who also lost Sakariya (4) off the final ball of the day following a correct caught behind DRS review off Akash Deep's bowling.\n\nSaurashtra beat Gujarat in a tense semifinal to reach here while Bengal stunned Karnataka in the last-four clash. Playing their fourth final in eight seasons, Saurashtra are looking to win their maiden Ranji Trophy title, while two-time winners Bengal have not won the competition since the 1989-90 season when their head coach Arun Lal was part of the team.\n\nBoth Pujara and Saha joined Saurashtra and Bengal, respectively, following their Test assignment for India in New Zealand. India lost the two-match series 0-2. While Pujara played both the matches, Saha was dropped for Rishabh Pant.\n\nMeanwhile, Sudeep Gharami made his first-class debut for Bengal on Monday.","970":"Ranji Trophy Final: Anustup Majumdar Scores Gritty Fifty To Keep Bengal Hopes Alive Against Saurashtra | Cricket News Bengal's 'Man Friday' Anustup Majumdar stood between Saurashtra and Ranji Trophy with a defiant unbeaten 58 as the summit clash entered a tantalising final day with the visitors needing 72 runs more. Bengal ended the fourth day at 354 for six as Majumdar added 91 runs for the unbroken seventh wicket stand with Arnab Nandi (28 batting, 82 balls), who showed a lot of courage despite getting hit on the finger by Jaydev Unadkat delivery.\n\nMajumdar, who had bailed Bengal out of a precarious position in the quarter as well as semi-final, was the saviour again and got much needed support from Nandi as the duo batted out the entire evening session to keep the match evenly poised going into day five.\n\nThe home team was guilty of poor fielding and allowing easy runs to Bengal in the final session where 90 runs were scored.\n\nHarvik Desai at first slip dropped a regulation catch of Majumdar, who was on 10 at that time, and it proved to be a costly miss.\n\nOn an absorbing day four, Bengal won the morning and evening session while Saurashtra stayed in the game by taking three wickets in the afternoon.\n\nBy day three, it had become clear that final will be decided by the first innings lead and both teams were locked in a fierce battle on day four.\n\nResuming the day at 134 for 3, Sudip Chatterrjee (81 off 241) and Wriddhiman Saha (64 off 184) kept Bengal's fight going with a 101-run partnership, consuming 49 overs in the process.\n\nThey frustrated Saurashtra in the wicket-less morning session, scoring 89 runs in 29 overs. With the odd ball keeping low, the predictable ploy was to target the stumps and bring the ball back in, which Saurashtra pacers managed to do both with the old and the second new ball. While Chatterjee, who resumed the day on 47, was solid in defence, Saha lived dangerously.\n\nThe India Test wicketkeeper, playing his first Ranji Trophy game of the season, survived two close DRS calls for LBW off lead pacer Jaydev Undakat and a suicidal attempt for a single that could have easily had him run out.\n\nHe was also dropped in the gully region on 46 but instead the ball deflected to the boundary, bringing up his half century.\n\nThe limited DRS in use was a talking point once again with Unadkat at the receiving end on both occasions with Saha being the batsman.\n\nIn the first instance, which took place in the third over of the day, Saha was adjudged out by the on-field umpire but on referral, third umpire S Ravi gave him not out. The ball shaped back in at sharply and Saha appeared to be plumb in front.\n\nThe second instance came late in the session and this time the ball seemed to be crashing the stumps but the on-field umpire did not give it out this time.\n\nOn referral, the replays showed only half of the ball was in line of the impact, therefore, the third umpire stayed with the on-field umpire's call, much to the frustration of Unadkat.\n\nHe was so sure about the call that he started celebrating even before the umpire's decision.\n\nIt was a shaky knock from Saha but he did have his moments, including two gorgeous cover drives off Unadkat before stepping out to smash spinner Jadeja for a straight six over mid-off.\n\nSaurashtra found a much-needed breakthrough in the eighth over after lunch when against the run of play, Chatterjee was caught at short leg off Jadeja.\n\nThat allowed Saurashtra to build pressure on the opposition and soon after, Saha's stay in the middle finally ended after played on to his stumps off medium pacer Prerak Mankad.\n\nIt was a thick edge which just kissed the off-stump to dislodge the bails.\n\nTowards the end of the afternoon session, left-arm pacer Chetan Sakariya crashed through Shahbaz Ahmed's stumps to make it 263 for six.\n\nIt was just the kind of session Saurashstra wanted as they conceded only 46 runs in 28 overs and more importantly took three wickets.","971":"Ranji Trophy Final: Bengal Fight Back Before Saurashtra Take Control On Day 3 | Cricket News Bengal veteran Manoj Tiwary and Sudip Chatterjee stitched a fighting stand on a deteriorating pitch in Rajkot but Saurashtra maintained their grip over the Ranji Trophy final on Day 3.\n\nSaurashtra maintained their grip over the Ranji Trophy final on day three despite a fighting stand between Bengal veteran Manoj Tiwary and Sudip Chatterjee on a deteriorating pitch in Rajkot on Wednesday. Chatterjee (47 not out off 145) and Tiwary (35 off 116) took a leaf out of Cheteshwar Pujara's book to share a gritty 89-run partnership off 226 balls after Bengal were in a spot of bother at 35 for two at lunch. Batting is only going to get tougher on this surface with the ball keeping low right from day one, making it a steep challenge for Bengal to get past Saurashtra's first innings total of 425.\n\nBengal reached 134 for three in 65 overs at close of play, trailing Saurashtra by 291 runs with Chatterjee and Wriddhiman Saha (4 off 43) in the middle.\n\nSaurashtra, who resumed the day at 384 for eight, went on to bat for one hour and 10 minutes in the morning session to add 41 valuable runs with the last wicket pair of Jaydev Unadkat and Dharemendrasinh Jadeja producing 38 runs.\n\nOn day two, Pujara and Arpit Vasavada batted together for five hours to put Saurashtra in a strong position and Bengal too will have to come up with something special to stay in the game.\n\nWhile Saurashtra are aiming for their maiden title, Bengal have not won Ranji Trophy since 1989-90.\n\nThe home team's bowlers will be aiming for the stumps on day four like they did on Wednesday, hoping the pitch does the rest.\n\nTiwary's dismissal clearly showed how tough it has become to bat on the uneven surface. Chirag Jani had him trapped in front of the stumps with a ball that came back in sharply at a low height and there was not much Tiwary could do about it.\n\nIt was a sort of redemption for Jani, who had overstepped when Tiwary, batting on 18, played on to his stumps.\n\nThe afternoon session was a good one for Bengal as they did not lose a wicket and collected 59 runs. Tiwary and Chatterjee provided the much needed fight back after Bengal lost their openers -- debutant Sudip Kumar Gharami (26) and Abhimanyu Easwaran (9), in the morning.\n\nGharami, who captains Bengal U-23, showed a lot of promise before getting caught at short leg off left-arm spinner Jadeja. He looked more assured than Easwaran who ended a forgettable season with the bat.\n\nGharami impressed by hitting opposition skipper Unadkat for two boundaries in the same over, one coming off a flick and the other with a beautiful straight drive.\n\nEaswaran's fall led to the lunch break but he would consider himself a tad unfortunate to be adjudged out lbw since the ball appeared to miss the stumps. He took the limited DRS on offer but the third umpire could not overule the on-field umpire's call as he did not have ball tracking available, raising questions over the restrictive use of the technology.\n\nChatterjee too survived a close DRS call late in the day after the on-field umpire adjudged him lbw off pacer Chetan Sakariya. No run came off the bat in the last 59 balls of the final session.\n\nEarly in the morning, Bengal pacer Akash Deep took his fourth wicket by getting through the defence of Jani, who was helpless with the ball keeping really low.\n\nHowever, Saurashtra added 38 runs for the 10th wicket to get past 400.","972":"Ranji Trophy Final: Cheteshwar Pujara Confident Of Jaydev Unadkat's India Comeback After Historic Ranji Season | Cricket News Now that he is a Ranji Trophy winner, Jaydev Unadkat hopes that \"people\" will not talk only about his IPL riches and says the hunger to make an India comeback has never been stronger following a sensational season. Saurashtra skipper and lead pacer Unadkat picked up 67 wickets this season at 13.23 but more importantly bowled match-winning spells in both the semi-final and final in Ranji Trophy. He took seven wickets against Gujarat and on Friday, dismissed a well-set Anustup Majumdar before effecting a run out in the same over to tilt the game decisively in his team's favour.\n\n\"I still have that hunger to make a comeback. The hunger has never been stronger than this and that actually kept me going throughout the season. To be honest, it was challenging physically surviving the season. Bowling those long spells as a fast bowler in almost every game,\" said Unadkat after captaining Saurashtra to their maiden trophy.\n\n\"I just want to keep this phase going. I don't want to end it here. Yes, we have won the trophy and I am the happiest captain in the world right now If I can say that.\"\n\nThe 28-year-old last played for India in 2018, a T20 International against Bangladesh, and he played his only Test in 2010 and last of his seven ODIs in 2013.\n\nSitting next to him and the trophy was his good friend and Saurashtra teammate Cheteshwar Pujara, who fully endorsed Unadkat's views.\n\n\"I agree Jaydev has bowled exceptionally well throughout the season. If someone takes 67 wickets in a season, I don't think there is anyone who can perform better in the Ranji Trophy. There has to be lot of importance to Ranji Trophy performance to get picked for the Indian team,\" Pujara said.\n\n\"Jaydev was modest that he would not be thinking about the Indian call but I will be surprised if he is not picked in the Indian team,\" said the Test specialist who too made a crucial contribution despite being unwell.\n\nUnadkat, who twice went for the big bucks in the IPL auction and is a main player for Rajasthan Royals, is glad that he has achieved a long pending dream.\n\n\"The second question about IPL does matter a lot to me. I have been working harder than many guys, as hard as any other cricketer in the country to earn my rewards. It was not just the IPL on my mind at any time. Yes, there was auction happening and people were talking just about that but this was something I really wanted to (win Ranji Trophy).\n\n\"I wanted to do it for the team, I wanted to do it for myself.

Pujara, who had returned from New Zealand only a couple of days ago, came in to bat at six instead of his usual number four spot (for India it is number three) due to a throat infection. The star batsman flicked pacer Ishan Porel on the second ball he played before collecting just one run off the next 22 balls.\n\nEventually, he decided to walk off the field at the end of the 77th over. Chetan Sakariya, who usually bats at number 11, was promoted for the second game in a row after Pujara's forced departure.\n\n\"He has fever and bad throat but should be fine to bat tomorrow,\" said Saurashtra skipper Jaydev Unadkat.\n\nThe hosts, aiming for the maiden title in their fourth attempt, badly needs Pujara's services on day two having reached 206 for five on the opening day.","974":"Ranji Trophy Final: Cheteshwar Pujara-Arpit Vasavada Marathon Stand Takes Saurashtra To 384\/8 On Day 2 | Cricket News Cheteshwar Pujara and Arpit Vasavada stitched a 142-run stand as Saurashtra claimed a strong position in their Ranji Trophy final against Bengal.\n\nCheteshwar Pujara and Arpit Vasavada gave a masterclass in defensive batting with a five-hour partnership on day two, taking Saurashtra to a strong position in their Ranji Trophy final against Bengal in Rajkot on Tuesday. Their 142-run stand off 380 balls wore down the opposition who had a slight edge after reducing Saurashtra to 206 for five on the opening day. Pujara (66 off 237), who was on five when he retired hurt on day one due to fever, and Vasavada (106 off 287) batted for two sessions and five overs as the hosts reached 384 for eight at the close of play. On day two, the hosts managed 178 runs in 79.1 overs for the loss of three wickets.\n\nSpeedster Mukesh Kumar removed Pujara and Prerak Mankad (0) in the final session but by then the damage had already been done.\n\nBengal took their first wicket of the day in the fifth over after tea with Wriddhiman Saha effecting a sharp stumping off Shahbaz Ahmed to send back Vasavada.\n\nBengal coach Arun Lal had rated the pitch as \"very poor\" on Monday with the odd ball keeping low but their pace attack could not make much use of the conditions after Akash Deep struck thrice on day one.\n\nRun scoring indeed was difficult but Pujara and Vasavada's plans were crystal clear: tire the bowlers out and pounce on the loose balls. Their stay in the middle may not have been pleasing to the eye but proved to be very effective.\n\nWhile it was a typical Pujara knock, full of patience, Vasavada, who is coached by the India batsman's father Arvind Pujara, made a bigger contribution to the team's cause with a back-to-back hundred and fourth of the season.\n\nVasavada, who had made a match-winning knock against Gujarat in the semi-final, played with remarkable patience and composure. His innings comprised 11 fours. This was Vasavada's eighth first-class hundred.\n\nIt was a commendable effort from Pujara too, considering that he had not been keeping well ever since his return from New Zealand last week. Such was the slow pace of the Pujara-Vasavada stand that the first boundary of the bat came in the 15th over of the day when Vasavada pulled Akash Deep.\n\nBengal, who had bowled 80.5 overs on day one, took the new ball after the 85th over but it did not lead to a breakthrough. Vasavada brought his fifty with a four off off-spinner Arnab Nandi, driving him past mid-on. Pujara broke the shackles in the following over by stepping out to cover-drive left-arm spinner Ahmed.\n\nSoon after, the Test specialist survived an lbw appeal after Bengal went for the limited DRS.\n\nThe closest Bengal came to getting a wicket in the afternoon session was when Vasavada straight-drove Mukesh, who claimed the ball kissed his hand before hitting the stumps with Pujara at the non-striker's end. However, the appeal was turned down as there was no conclusive evidence.\n\nThe left-handed Vasavada reached three figures 20 minutes before the tea break as he cut one off Nandi through cover, leading to an intense celebration.\n\nThe entire dressing room applauded his valuable effort for which he also got a hug from Pujara.\n\nPujara, who collected five boundaries, got his half-century off 191 balls at the stroke of tea. In the morning and afternoon session combined, Saurashtra scored 133 runs in 58.1 overs.\n\nPujara's best shot of the day came when he caressed one off Akash Deep between cover and point.\n\nSaurashtra batsman Vishvaraj Jadeja, who scored a half-century on day one, had hoped for 100-150 runs on day two. The home team got more than that.","975":"Ranji Trophy Final: Saurashtra Beat Bengal To Clinch Maiden Ranji Trophy Title | Cricket News Saurashtra won their maiden Ranji Trophy title on Friday on the back of their first innings lead against Bengal in the final played at the Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium.

Saurashtra had posted 425 in their first innings riding on a brilliant century from Arpit Vasavada and gritty half-centuries from Avi Barot, Vishvaraj Jadeja and Cheteshwar Pujara.\n\nThey then restricted Bengal on 381, thus taking a crucial lead of 44 runs on the final day of the match. Dharmendrasinh Jadeja was the pick of the bowlers as he scalped three wickets, while skipper Jaydev Unadkat and Prerak Mankad picked two wickets each.\n\nIn their second innings, Saurashtra put up 105 runs for the loss of four wickets in the 34 overs they batted on the final day before the players shook hands and agreed on a mutual draw.\n\nAccording to the rules of the tournament, if the final match is heading towards the draw, then whoever manages to take the first-innings lead is declared as the winner.\n\nDuring the course of the game, Unadkat also broke a 21-year-old record as he became the fast bowler with most wickets in a single Ranji season. He picked up 65 wickets in the season and snapped the record which was previously held by Karnataka's Dodda Ganesh. The Karnataka pacer had bagged 62 wickets in 1998-99 season.\n\nAfter the match, Pujara -- who is India's batting mainstay when it comes to Test cricket -- said: \"It's a great feeling and we are in a different world altogether. At the start of the season, we believed that we could win. Last season, we lost in the final, we had a chat after that and credit goes to the boys.\n\n\"The best thing about this team is most of them have played cricket together for a long time. Everyone contributes at sometime or the other. Not many state teams play as a team. It's a nice unit and whenever I am here, I always feel comfortable. We are working towards one process and we got the title today.\"","976":"Ranji Trophy Final: Saurashtra Pitch Curator Describes Arun Lal's Criticism As \"Poor Judgment\" | Cricket News Arun Lal's \"very poor pitch\" comment on the opening day drew a sharp rebuttal from Saurashtra Cricket Association on Wednesday when its curator Mahendra Rajdev said the Bengal coach erred in his judgement by jumping the gun in the Ranji Trophy final in Rajkot. Saurashtra, who reached 206 for five on day one, went on to post a formidable 425 on day three. The pitch is certainly a tricky one with the ball keeping low frequently but Cheteshwar Pujara and Arpit Vasavada showed remarkable application with a five-hour stand on day two.\n\n\"The pitch may not have had extra bounce which Bengal bowlers were looking for, but that does not make the wicket poor,\" said Rajdev in a SCA statement.\n\n\"It is a rather hasty and poor judgment by the Bengal Coach and it may not be beneficial for their own players when the coach makes a statement like this.\n\n\"It is the same pitch for both the teams, which was prepared under the neutral curator (L Prashanth Rao) from the BCCI,\" he added.\n\nLal, in fact, had maintained his stance on the pitch after day two saying it was a dead pitch which can't be good for cricket.\n\nAn SCA official told PTI there are no plans of making a formal complaint to the BCCI over Lal's tirade.\n\nThe match referee will be submitting its report to the BCCI which is standard practice.\n\n\"It was way too early for Lal to talk the way he did. It is a decent wicket. The match had hardly begun and he spoke like this. He should have been more careful with his words,\" the official said.","977":"Ranji Trophy Final: Saurashtra Poised For Glory At Home, Face Bengal In Summit Clash | Cricket News Saurashtra, led by inspirational Jaydev Unadkat, will back themselves to win an elusive Ranji Trophy title at home but a buoyant Bengal will be no pushovers in what promises to be an absorbing final beginning on Monday. Both the teams are desperate to go all the way with Saurashtra reaching their fourth final in eight seasons while Bengal has not tasted success in the premier domestic event since the 1989-90 triumph. While Bengal bulldozed over the mighty Karnataka in the semifinals, Saurashtra edged out Gujarat in a see-saw contest at the SCA Stadium, which is also the venue for the final.\n\nThere will also be star power on display with Test regulars Cheteshwar Pujara and Wriddhiman Saha joining the Saurashtra and Bengal squads respectively, having returned from New Zealand.\n\nIn fact, Pujara was very much Saurasthra's 12th man with Unadkat being in constant touch with his senior teammate during the hard-fought semifinal.\n\nNow his physical presence in the all-important game will be a big boost to the side.\n\nSaurashtra would not have ended up on the right side of the result against Gujarat if it wasn't for Unadkat, who has had a sensational run this season with 65 wickets at an average of 12.17 and is three shy of the all-time record of 68 scalps, set by Bihar spinner Ashutosh Aman last season.\n\nThe left-arm pacer single-handedly led his team on day five earlier this week with a seven-wicket haul on a flat surface, including the scalps of a set Parthiv Patel and Chirag Gandhi, who had brought Gujarat back in the game from a hopeless 63 for five while chasing 327.\n\nUnadkat's stellar performances over the course of the season has put him back in national reckoning but in his own words, they would count for little if the team doesn't go all the way.\n\nNot just with the ball, he also inspired with his captaincy and one example of that was when he promoted number 11 Chetan Sakariya, who shared a crucial 90-run stand with Arpit Vasavada (139) after the hosts collapsed to 15 for five.\n\nThe skipper is leading from the front but will expect more from his fellow pacers who have not done much to write about this season. Besides Pujara, the team's leading run-getter Sheldon Jackson will be expected to shoulder the batting responsibilities.\n\nSaurashtra will be wary of Bengal's potent pace attack which fashioned their comprehensive win over eight-time champions Karnataka.\n\nThe pace trio of Ishan Porel, Mukesh Kumar and Akash Deep were on fire in the semifinal and has contributed significantly to the team's overall success.\n\nLeft-arm spinner Shahbaz Ahmed has come of age this season and is the team's joint highest wicket-taker with 30 scalps alongside Kumar and Akash Deep.\n\nThe onus in the batting department lies on veteran Manoj Tiwary, who has been the team's leading run-getter with 672 runs from 10 games but has not fired after his couple of match-winning half-centuries on a challenging track in Patiala.\n\nThe role of head coach Arun Lal also cannot be overlooked in Bengal's first final appearance after 13 years.\n\nSquads:\n\nSaurashtra: Cheteshwar Pujara, Jaydev Unadkat (c), Chirag Jani, Kamlesh Makvana, Sheldon Jackson, Arpit Vasavada, Kushang Patel, Dharmendrasinh Jadeja, Avi Barot , Divyaraj Chauhan, Snell Patel, Vandit Jivrajani, Samarth Vyas, Prerak Mankad, Jay Chauhan, Harvik Desai (wk), Kishan Parmar, Vishvaraj Jadeja, Chetan Sakariya, Parth Bhut.\n\nBengal: Manoj Tiwary, Wriddhiman Saha, Ashok Dinda, Shreevats Goswami, Anustup Majumdar, Arnab Nandi, Sudip Chatterjee, Abhimanyu Easwaran (c), Writtick Chatterjee, Koushik Ghosh, Mukesh Kumar, Sayan Ghosh, Ishan Porel, Nilkantha Das, Agniv Pan, Ayan Bhattacharjee, Abhishek Raman, Boddupalli Amit, Ritwik Chowdhury, Prayas Barman, Shahbaz Ahmed, Karan Lal, Akash Deep, Shreyan Chakraborty, Kazi Saifi, Ramesh Prasad.\n\nMatch starts 9.30 am IST.","978":"Ranji Trophy Final: Umpire Hit On Abdomen, Ruled Out Of Saurashtra-Bengal Summit Clash | Cricket News On-field umpire C Shamshuddin was on Tuesday ruled out for the remainder of the Ranji Trophy final after he got hit around the lower abdomen area on the opening day of the title clash between Bengal and Saurashtra.

But, since there are two sides to every coin, I guess it's only fair to also tell you where I've gone wrong.\n\nSo you don't think me a completely poor buyer, I'd suggest first reading the previous article about which items made the good purchases list before reading this one. But, in case you'd like to read your bad news first, I'll repeat the basic disclaimer here that I made previously.\n\nEvery item on this list, both good values and bad values, are terrific products. No items on the list below are bad products. This is not a product review. Instead, this ranking is a personal attempt to access how much value I have personally gotten out of the items in my gear closet based on how much I spent and how much has each product paid off for me. That last part is especially important. I can only access value based on how I use the items and my own needs. A passing quarterback that gets drafted onto an NFL team that only ever runs the ball and winds up sitting on the bench doesn't suddenly suck as a quarterback. He just wasn't the right fit.\n\nThe list is also meant to be fun. Today's list actually pokes more fun at me than the products themselves, as they each, in some way, represent a failure on my part to take into account exactly how each purchase would provide a return on investment. But, this doesn't mean that the exact same products wouldn't be the perfect investment for you.\n\nSo, with the disclaimer out of the way, let's get to the list on my less wise purchasing decisions.\n\nAbout Two-Thirds of My Fuji X Lens Lineup\n\nI talked at length in the best value article about how quickly I fell in love with the Fuji X system. The size, speed, and simple joy of use are nearly impossible to match. And, at the price point, you'd be hard-pressed to find a camera system that gives you so much for so little. I loved shooting with my X-T2 and X-T3. I loved it so much, in fact, that I quickly started building up my collection of Fuji X mount lenses. I wanted to use the camera more and more, so logically, I wanted to have a complete set of lenses to take into any situation. I even reached a point at some time last year where I had just about every Fuji X lens that I could ever possibly consider using.\n\nI absolutely love the system. So, how can it be on both the best purchase list and the worst purchase list simultaneously? Well, again, I remind you that this is not a product review. Every single one of those Fuji X lenses I bought was amazing. Tack sharp, small, and quick. Compared to other systems, they are also incredibly affordable, which is why I was able to complete my collection so quickly.\n\nBut here's the thing. In the throes of my love affair with my Fuji X-T3, I'd taken my eye off of the larger picture. I knew that I loved the camera. But, I'd missed the point as to why I loved the camera. Yes, the image quality from the X system is fantastic, especially given a small size. But the reason I was using it for my personal work as opposed to my Nikon wasn't because of superior image quality. No, the reason I loved using the Fuji X system was that it was small. I spend all day holding a Nikon D850 with a heavy 24-70mm f\/2.8 attached and lugging around Pelican cases full of lights. What the Fuji X-T3 was really offering me was the ability to move around lighter and less encumbered.\n\nBill Clinton is famous for saying in response to a question about winning elections, \"It's the economy, stupid.\" Regardless of your political persuasion, all the great minds in political strategy can't outthink the economy. Generally speaking, the better the economy, the better the results for the man or woman in the office.\n\nI love my X-T3 for several reasons. The dials, the ease of use, the colors, the inspiration. But, at the end of the day, the reason I was picking it up as opposed to other cameras in my possession was that it was small. It was easy to toss into my backpack or into the center console of my car and just have with me at all times. In other words, I should have been telling myself, \"it's the size, stupid.\"\n\nSo, when I started buying every Fuji lens under the sun, while it seemed logical, it was actually against my best interest. As I got more lenses and accessories, the size of my Fuji system moved from a shoulder bag into its own Pelican case. I was inadvertently taking away my reason for having the Fuji in the first place. Once a camera system requires its own Pelican case, it invites the question of why I would bring it as opposed to just bringing my D850. Again, it was the size of the D850 I was escaping, not the image quality. Previously, the X-T3 was being asked to fill a niche. It was a relief compared to my everyday work. After all the build-up, it was being asked to win a one-on-one battle with the heavyweight champ.\n\nOf course, there's no requirement that I take all my Fuji lenses with me at all times. Eventually, this is what I started doing. The only lenses I ever really found myself using were the 27mm f\/2.8 pancake lens for walkaround photography, the 16mm f\/1.4 for video, and the 35mm f\/1.4 for walkaround and people photography. The rest of the lenses stayed home in the land that time forgot along with a couple of Nikon lenses who had met the same fate.\n\nSo, while all of these lenses were amazing performers, none got the chance to perform very often, thus making them a less than valuable investment. In fact, I just sold a number of them off to invest in more lights. Like most of my failed relationships, it wasn't them, it was me.\n\nNow, had the X-T3 been my primary camera system, purchasing a complete set of lenses would have been a smart move. But, because, for me, it was a complementary system, I should have done a better job of assessing the source of its value to my overall toolkit.\n\nArri Softlight Kit\n\nBefore I was a photographer, I was a filmmaker. I studied cinematography, and so much of what I knew about lighting was based on how I lit my films. When I became a still photographer, I started to hear about these things called strobes. I didn't know much about them, but they sure sounded intimidating.\n\nSo, my first still photography lighting decision was to purchase hot lights instead. Like the other products on this list, the lights themselves are amazing: a pair of 650W fresnels and another 1x1 foot softlight. This is in the days long before LEDs, for those of you wondering. Although your electricity bill starts to cry every time you plug them in, the lights work perfectly. These lights are made to work day in and day out on a hectic film set, and they will last pretty much forever. So, why are they on the poor investment side of the list?\n\nSimple, I purchased them out of fear. I didn't buy these lights because they were the right tool for the job. I bought them because I was afraid to learn a new technology and wanted to stick with what was safe. But, spoiler alert, if you want to be a professional photographer, at some point, you are going to have to learn how to use off-camera flash. Whether or not it becomes part of your personal aesthetic or not is another thing entirely. But, you need to know how to use them even if you choose not to.\n\nSo, inevitably, as my career progressed, I got to a point where I needed to learn how to use strobes. I actually reached that point relatively quickly, meaning that the Arri system I spent a decent amount of money on over 15 years ago has been used mostly as a glorified step stool around the house. Even as I write this, I have to think twice to try and remember where the system even currently is in my house.\n\nI have turned it on a few times over the years. And every time I fire it up, it works without a hitch. But it makes this list because I personally made the mistake of letting my fear prevent me from selecting the best tool for the job.\n\nFuji GFX 100\n\nI debated whether or not to put this on the list, because I didn't want to give the impression to anyone who might be reading that this camera is anything short of a technological marvel. The images this thing creates are second to none. The files are nothing short of amazing. If you want the ultimate in image quality, look no further. I actually just shot something with it yesterday, and, even after a year, I am still blown away each time I open the files in Capture One. So, why is it on this end of the list?\n\nIn case you don't remember from the first part of this series, a quick reminder of what I do, as it will affect the explanation to follow. Professionally, I shoot advertising campaigns for fitness and activewear brands. So I require high megapixel counts for large-scaled detailed prints and potentially substantial cropping. But, unlike for instance someone who shoots product still lifes inside a studio, because of my fast-moving subject matter I also require fast and accurate autofocus speed, higher burst rates, and a bright clear viewfinder to capture fast-moving action. Before purchasing the GFX 100, most of my professional work was shot with either a Nikon D850 or with a (rented) Hasselblad or Phase One medium format system.\n\nMy purchase of the GFX 100 was motivated by a desire to deliver my clients top-class image quality while personally getting the user experience delivered by my Fuji X series cameras. I've written extensive reviews on both why I bought the camera as well as how I feel about the camera currently. I won't rehash all of that here.\n\nWhat I saw on the spec sheet of the GFX 100 was the perfect balance between image quality and a skillset to match my workflow. Well, it definitely delivered on the first count. The second? Well, this is where that disclaimer about this list being specific to my own workflow and shooting style comes into effect.\n\nIf you shoot anything stationary, like landscapes, still lifes, posed portraits, or even general street photography then the GFX 100 is nothing short of a godsend. When the focus locks on, the images coming out of this camera are the most detailed that I've ever seen. It provides the perfect medium format feel, which is hard to describe, but, for me, comes down to making you feel like an image is an entire world in and of itself. The camera can absolutely deliver the technical quality that even the most demanding client could ever ask for.\n\nThe problem I made is that I paid too much attention to the spec sheet and image quality and not enough attention to how I actually shoot in real life. I am dedicated to my craft, technically knowledgeable, and determined to deliver only the highest quality end product that I can. I plan. I brainstorm. I experiment. I put all my passion into my work and hit the set like a whirlwind of ideas, moving from one setup to the next at a frenzied pace that leaves me thoroughly exhausted at the end of the day.\n\nBut despite all my preparation and focus, I am not slow and methodical. When I shoot, I want to be on the move, both literally and figuratively. I want to move onto a new concept the very instant the thought enters my head. I want to transition my subjects from portraiture to Crossfit at the drop of a hat. I'll change speed and directions faster than you can blink an eye. Whereas some really amazing photographers will spend an entire day working on one concept, my brain works exactly the opposite. I have to keep moving onto the next thing. I'm a bit OCD, with or without a camera, and I'm driven to fit all my various ideas into as short a time as possible. Simply put, I move. I care about precision. But I care more about individual moments, many of which come about spontaneously.\n\nThe GFX 100 is a camera, while delivering superior image quality, that is designed for photographers who take their time and have advance notice of what is going to occur in front of them. And despite being advised to do so by lots of my early mentors in the industry, I've learned over the years that slow is simply not how my creative brain functions best. I can go slowly. I have gone slowly. There are even easily identifiable benefits to going slowly, like going deeper and really exploring a concept. But, in general, I personally get better images with a cheap camera and the ability to move freely than I do with an expensive camera but confined to work slowly. Again, that is 100% a personal thing and not at all a judgment of the camera. Over the years, I've just learned how my creative engine runs best.\n\nOf course, when judging the value of an investment, I have to take into consideration how useful it is to me. After all, I'm the one that spent the money. And regardless of how perfect the fit seemed on paper, in actuality, I've found myself reverting to using the Nikon D850 for 95% of my workload. The GFX 100 has its place. I mostly use it for rare formal portraits or just as a personal walkaround camera. Despite its size, I do love shooting with it.\n\nBut, just like signing a backup quarterback in the NFL, is it worth spending big money on a player that isn't going to start the big games? For the most high-pressure ad jobs, the jobs where this camera was meant to fit, I generally still find myself wanting to rent a Hasselblad or Phase One. For other professional and spec shoots, I find myself turning to the Nikon D850. And for traveling light, I turn to the X-T3. So, despite its quality, the camera doesn't get very much time on the field.\n\nI will say that I'm still holding out hope that this purchase won't be a permanent resident on this list. As I described in my best value article when discussing the Canon EOS C200, sometimes, products simply take a bit of time to integrate into your system. At first, they may not seem like the best choice. But as you learn more about them, their benefits start to pay off down the line. The GFX 100 certainly has enough potential to develop. For a more methodical photographer, it would be the perfect tool. And I am absolutely positive that there are still shortcuts with the camera that will allow me to use it more efficiently than I will eventually learn. But at the moment, it makes the lower value end of the list simply because I inaccurately predicted where it would fit into my gear team and overestimated my ability to adapt my shooting style to fit with the camera.\n\nPretty Much Any Gimbal I've Ever Bought\n\nI love footage shot with a Steadi-Cam or the poor man's version, the gimbal. There's nothing better than long tracking shots where the camera seems to glide through the air free of being tethered to physical bounds. I love this technique so much that I've tried to incorporate it into my own work. Actually, I've tried several times. And those trials have all included the purchase of a brand new gimbal that promises to provide me with smooth footage with limited hassle.\n\nAnd, for the most part, they deliver. Aside from the mechanical Glidecam which I never did get the hang of, a result of user failure not device failure, all the motorized gimbals I've purchased have done the job they were intended to. Once you get going, they deliver smooth video movements and a professional feel. S,o what's the problem? And why have these purchases been the absolute worst purchases of my career?\n\nBecause I never use them. Despite an abundance of YouTube videos discussing how easy it is to balance a camera on a gimbal, I admit to being an abject failure in that category. While the motorized ones are easier, it's still not something that comes easy to me, and it's not due to lack of trying. So, while I certainly can balance a camera eventually, it still takes me absolutely forever to do so, like an embarrassingly long time filled with several curse words and pleas for help from a supreme being.\n\nIf I have an unusually long prep period or an assistant who can set it up for me, I'm good to go. But, in actual practice, the entire setup usually ends up just taking me so darn long that I give up halfway through and simply revert to hand-holding the camera and trying to quell my shaky knees. It's not ideal, but as mentioned in the last section, I like to move quickly, and I'd rather risk having to edit around a less than perfectly smooth shot than to cool off the subject as they wait for me to set up the gimbal.\n\nIn a way, this final entry is the perfect encapsulation of what ultimately determines a product's value as an investment. Value can't be judged simply by numbers on a spec sheet or by how other photographers you know are using the equipment. As I've even said multiple times throughout this article, my thoughts above are based solely on my own needs and shooting style. That's the only truly honest perspective I can offer. Value has to be a personal thing. It can only be judged by how you will use the equipment personally. Does it fit not only your technical needs, but your shooting style? Is it the best tool for the job or just the best tool on the market? Those aren't always the same thing. Do you know specifically why you're buying a product? If you don't, you're likely to end up buying the wrong product or spending too much on a higher-end product when a lower-priced one might be a better fit.\n\nOf course, these are only my opinions. And every single item on this list is a great product for the right customer. And there are surely several products on the market that I have yet to have a great fortune, or misfortune, to purchase. So, what are your best purchases? And what is your worst?","980":"Rant & Rave: Readers have appreciation, complaints for neighbors RAVE to the neighbor who has spent hours weeding in our small local Seattle park to expose the tulips (and other flowers) from the underbrush and accumulations of nature\/winter.\n\nRANT to our neighbor for having friends over during the stay-at-home order.

Rbm24 is an RNA-binding protein with highly conserved expression in differentiating lens fiber cells among all vertebrates. We use a zebrafish model to demonstrate that loss of Rbm24 function specifically impedes lens fiber cell differentiation, resulting in cataract formation and blindness. Molecular analyses reveal that Rbm24 interacts with cytoplasmic polyadenylation complex and binds to a large number of lens-expressed messenger RNAs to maintain their stability and protect their poly(A) tail length, thereby crucially contributing to their efficient translation into functional proteins. This work identifies an important mechanism by which Rbm24 posttranscriptionally controls lens gene expression to establish transparency and refraction power.","986":"Readers Write: Coronavirus, Upper Harbor Terminal development, Nikki Haley Social distancing is the work of social justice.

And be patient with each other, knowing that we'll get through this better when we get through it together (and six feet apart from each other).\n\nThanks to a Monday letter writer for the positive suggestions for those of us hunkered mostly at home. Here are a few more:\n\n*\u2009Organize your pantry\/cupboards and put the oldest food in front.\n\n*\u2009Tell someone you love your favorite memory of them.\n\nRarely have I read a Star Tribune column as persuasive as the piece by Thomas Fisher's, head of the Minnesota Design Center at the University of Minnesota, pointing out the folly of the current \"plan\" to redo the Upper Harbor Terminal in Minneapolis (\"Plan for riverfront lacks foresight,\" March 14). Fisher says that he does not \"know of any new development, anywhere, that puts people by the highway and factories by the park.\" In addition to blocking off the near-north neighborhood from the river and preventing housing from viewing the Mississippi, one more bad outcome Fisher does not mention is building yet another outdoor concert destination -- with public money. Who believes the Twin Cities needs this?\n\nFrom our condo, we can see Parade Stadium, the Walker Art Center hillside, Target Field -- already perfectly good outdoor music venues. In addition, the metro area has TCF stadium, the St. Paul Saints stadium, the new soccer stadium, the zoo, Surly's, the State Fair Grandstand and Canterbury Park, all of which already host outdoor music events. There are also many indoor concert venues like the Target Center, U.S. Bank Stadium and First Avenue.\n\nI see George Will has started his Nikki-Haley-for-president campaign (\"Haley picks a worthy fight,\" Opinion Exchange, March 16). And while she would no doubt be somewhat better than the current occupant, let us examine some of Will's assertions.\n\nThe Constitution is about capitalism: free enterprise promoted by the slaveholders Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, George Washington, and on and on -- men who \"competed\" using unpaid labor held in bondage by the laws they passed, preserved and enforced. Yes, invigorating, freedom-loving capitalism.\n\nAnd Haley's South Carolina capitalism: I have in front of me an article from the State, South Carolina's leading newspaper, from June 16, 2015, reporting the $123 million in incentives that then-Gov. Haley's government handed to Volvo to snag its manufacturing plant. This is precisely the sort of rent-seeking that Will regularly condemns. Yes, that's Republican capitalism -- soak the taxpayers for private profit.\n\nTo Will, socialism leads inexorably to Nicolas Maduro's Venezuela, yet corporate socialism -- take from the taxpayers, give to Volvo -- is the essence of liberty.\n\nWill praises South Carolina for having changed \"more, and more for the better, than any state in the previous 50 years.\" According to recent statistics, South Carolina ranks 43rd among the 50 states in life expectancy, 43rd in income and 44th in overall health. Way to go, South Carolina! Naturally the states that are even worse are low-wage, anti-union states ... like South Carolina.\n\nLions, tigers and socialists! Oh, my! I had thought we were long past the point where capitalism was considered to be an all-or-nothing proposition. The Great Depression, almost 100 years ago now, should have put the final nail in the coffin containing the notion that the tide of unbridled capitalism would unerringly lift all boats. I was wrong.\n\nI would not dispute that capitalism has been a powerful engine driving a certain kind of progress. But I also assume that most Americans would agree that implementing and maintaining a social safety net to protect our less fortunate neighbors from capitalism's sharp edges is not just an acceptable but a necessary function of government. Pop quiz: Who said, \"The moral test of government is how that government treats those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy and the handicapped\"? A) Hubert Humphrey or B) Che Guevara? It was, of course, that wild-eyed revolutionary and former vice president of the United States, the honorable Hubert H. Humphrey.\n\nSocialists are the enemy du jour, and Haley sees creeping socialism everywhere. She brands as closet socialists her fellow Republicans who are crazy enough to suggest that running a business might possibly be about more than the single-minded pursuit of the greatest possible profits. She labels as socialist any government regulation standing in the way of unrestricted profit-seeking. Beware the socialists (or the anarchists\/foreigners\/hippies\/commies)! They've come to take our freedoms. With such scare tactics, Haley roots herself firmly in the '90s. Not the 1990s, but the 1890s.","987":"Readers Write: Sid Hartman turns 100, mining waste, shooting ranges, state taxes and Social Security Hooray! Inspiration, anticipation, hope. The Sid Hartman story goes well beyond sports (\"Giving thanks at 100 for a newspaper career,\" Sundays with Sid column, March 15, and other coverage). We read so much about quality of life and how it affects senior citizens. When I see someone like Sid, it reminds me and it should remind others that indeed the senior years can be so productive and enjoyable. It should take away the uncalled fear that aging may bring.\n\nMany do not realize it, but we as an American society are living in the age of enlightenment. Length of life, options and quality of life have been at all-time highs in human history. My sister Kim, who lives in Cottage Grove, is a casual sports fan, but she marvels at the quality and longevity of Hartman's life. We both possess Hartman bobbleheads. That is a great memory of him that represents his legacy.\n\nFolks, when you look at it, yes, he is a legend in the sports world but he has represented a much broader appeal. He gave inspiration, anticipation and hope that indeed in our longer live spans all of our years can be useful and bountiful. Once again at the great Minnesota Get-Together this year, I look forward to seeing Minnesota's close personal friend.\n\nCongratulations to Sid Hartman on his centennial. As a former Star Tribune assistant sports editor, I often claim to have translated Sid's copy into English. But he also taught me an important lesson about writing for a newspaper: Don't waste the readers' time; get to the point.\n\nIn the 100 stories about Sid, I missed my favorite one, perhaps apocryphal: While on assignment for a Super Bowl in Florida, he and fellow Tribune columnist Joe Soucheray were driving past the gilded palaces of Miami Beach. Sid, the astute real estate investor, allowed that place was certainly prosperous, but added: \"Without that ocean there, it'd be nothing!\"\n\nTime to bring back the MPCA's Citizens' Board (killed in 2015)\n\nThe March 15 commentary \"Forty years ago this week: The day they stopped dumping mining waste at Silver Bay\" -- by Peter Gove, Robert Herbst, Eldon Kaul and David Zentner -- certainly didn't bury the lede.\n\nThe authors' first sentence, \"Water is Minnesota's No. 1 natural resource,\" almost said it all. They might have added, \"copper and nickel are not, thuggish Iron Range legislators notwithstanding.\"\n\nThanks for the thoughtful and thorough reminder of the damage we invite by failing to protect the environment. Now that state Sen. Tom Bakk (who inserted the last-minute provision into 2015 legislation killing the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency Citizens' Board for thinking about regulating sulfides), is no longer calling the shots for the DFL, the Legislature should consider reinstating it.\n\nThis doesn't sound like a job for the Minnesota DNR\n\nThe Minnesota section of the Sunday March 15 Star Tribune had a short item informing us that the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources is offering grants from $2,500 to $25,000 for new, expanded or improved practice shooting ranges. I fail to see how helping those who want to practice shooting clay pigeons falls under the jurisdiction of the DNR! Maybe the NRA?\n\nAt present, 40% of our 10,000 lakes and rivers are polluted and the numbers increase every year. I spent a few years on a lake association board and know that monetary grants would go a long way in helping lakes find the source of the pollution and then taking the next steps to mitigate the problem.\n\nI suggest letting those who wish to improve target practicing sights fund it themselves and direct DNR funding toward its own target: restoring Minnesota's greatest \"natural resource.\"\n\nThe proposed Social Security break and other considerations\n\nI read with interest the March 15 article \"Legislation looks at tax on Social Security benefits.\"\n\nIt seems appropriate to question how much eliminating state income tax would reduce the departure of Minnesota retirees out of state. The tax change last year increased deductions connected to Social Security, which lowered the tax burden for those beneficiaries providing significant relief from prior tax provisions.\n\nThat provided no relief for government retirees whose public service was under programs preceding Social Security and exempted as a result. When I began my career as a federal employee at the Social Security Administration, I was under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) that began in 1920, even though most workers at that time gained Social Security coverage when that program was introduced after 1934. My career, like many other public servants', took me to other states, where I established connections and felt part of those other communities. As a result, I (and others like me) am more likely than most to comfortably leave Minnesota in retirement. I feel strongly that my life work makes me a real asset to the community through continued service and volunteer work now that I am retired.\n\nBefore we provide more Social Security tax breaks, we need to extend the current retirement income provisions in fairness to those retired public servants who spend a career dedicated to making sure benefits were available to all in our communities.\n\nJim Ryan, Golden Valley\n\nThe writer is legislative vice president for the NARFE (National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association) Minnesota Federation.\n\nI am a retired person who moved from Minnesota to Arizona. The move had nothing to do with taxes of any sort. Yes, when people choose to move they may move to areas with lower taxes, but my contention is that moving has little to do with taxes; rather, the choice is made because of other factors. To my surprise, I quickly noticed that there is a cost to having lower state taxes. I would suggest that before any taxes are lowered the politicians come up with a specific list of items that would not be funded. I have found that roads, education, health care and parks are much better in Minnesota. Another downside of lower income taxes are the fees and sales taxes in other areas to make up for the lost income tax. The grass is not always greener on the other side of the fence.\n\nSocial Security benefits should not be nor should have ever been taxed by the federal or the state governments.\n\nThe history of the IRS taxing SS benefits goes back to 1984, when a bipartisan bill was introduced that the wealthy, defined as those married couples making more than $34,000 a year jointly, would pay income taxes on half of their SS benefits over that amount. Two issues with that taxing theory: First, it's never been adjusted for inflation, and if it had been, that amount today would be north of $100,000 and out of reach of most retirement incomes -- however, still at $35,000 it is well within reach and is now taxable by most retired taxpayers. Second, retirement incomes today derived from IRA and 401(k) accounts that barely existed pre-1984 have increased retirees income to an all-time high, and once again instead of being rewarded for doing well, we are punished and under current law may pay income taxes on up to 85% of our SS benefits. Furthermore, it's just bad law; SS is the return of our own money that was mandated to be removed from our paychecks. How does that money even qualify as income? The tax should be removed both federal and state.","988":"Reading Proust on My Cellphone I glided through sentence after sentence, volume after volume, on my Android in the nighttime darkness. The experience was remarkably ... Proustian.\n\nLink Copied\n\nA long time ago I was hopelessly hung up, and not in a good way, on a certain passage in Proust's Remembrance of Things Past. The offending passage, obstructing all the rest of Proust for me, lay in the very middle volume, the fourth of seven, which was then called Cities of the Plain (and has since been retranslated, with more accuracy and more filth, as Sodom and Gomorrah).\n\nThere was no reason I should have been waylaid there. This was the volume that thrilled Colette: \"No one in the world has written pages such as these on homosexuals, no one!\" It was the volume, according to Proust's newest biographer, Benjamin Taylor, that outraged and possibly killed Count Robert de Montesquiou (the supposed model for the sneering gay aristocrat Baron de Charlus). And it was the volume that Andr\u00e9 Gide abhorred for its sneaky, secretive, un-Greek view of homosexuality.\n\nHere is a scene from that volume. Standing by a window, behind shutters, the narrator daydreams about a bee buzzing near an eager flower, its stamens \"spontaneously curved so that the insect might more easily receive their offering.\" Now his focus shifts to the tryst unfolding below, between Charlus (also known as Palam\u00e8de de Guermantes) and the Guermanteses' ex-tailor, Jupien, who is younger and of a lower class. The narrator describes how each man was transformed once he was sure no one was watching him.\n\nM. de Charlus had relaxed that tension in his face, deadened that artificial vitality, which the animation of his talk and the force of his will kept in evidence there as a rule ... He seemed already carved in stone.\n\nAs for the tailor,\n\nJupien, shedding at once the humble, honest expression which I had always associated with him, had -- in perfect symmetry with the Baron -- thrown up his head, given a becoming tilt to his body, placed his hand with a grotesque impertinence on his hip, stuck out his behind, posed himself with the coquetry that the orchid might have adopted on the providential arrival of the bee.\n\nHow could I possibly be stuck in that volume? But I was. And as the years wore on, my shame at not being able to move on prevented me from returning to that volume so that I could move on. Of course, there was no cause for shame; I had effectively made it to the base camp of Everest and turned back on account of bad weather ahead. I had trotted gaily through the first part of my silver paperback Moncrieff and Kilmartin edition, which included Swann's Way and Within a Budding Grove (the volume now called In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower). I had scrambled, then slogged, through the social-climbing scree fields of The Guermantes Way. I had covered plenty of ground.\n\nAnd then I hit the roadblock in Sodom and Gomorrah. This moment reminds me of a scene in Seinfeld when Elaine tells her friends about her desperate drive to Kennedy airport to get rid of a guy she's had a fling with:\n\nI was going faster than I've ever gone before ... I was challenging the very laws of physics ... I had it. I was there. And then I hit the Van Wyck. They say no one's ever beaten the Van Wyck, but gentlemen ... I came as close as anyone ever has. And if it hadn't been for that five-car pileup on Rockaway Boulevard, that numskull would be on a plane.\n\nYes, I would have made it to the Proustian equivalent of JFK had it not been for the five-car pileup that followed the sexy scene between Charlus and Jupien.\n\nLittle did I know then (I learned it only recently from Nathan Brixius, who blogs about data analytics, sports, and, apparently, Proust), but I was stuck on what seems to be the longest sentence in Remembrance of Things Past -- a 958-word colossus. That is more than twice as long as the sentence Alain de Botton, in his short, witty book How Proust Can Change Your Life, claims is the longest and can \"stretch around the base of a bottle of wine seventeen times.\"\n\nThe gist of this lengthy, almost unparseable sentence is the remarkably pungent observation by Proust, who was both gay and part Jewish, that in society, homosexuals are\n\nlike the Jews ... shunning one another, seeking out those who are most directly their opposite, who do not desire their company, pardoning their rebuffs, moved to ecstasy by their condescension; but also brought into the company of their own kind by the ostracism that strikes them.\n\nI really don't know why I was stalled. Perhaps it was simply the length. Perhaps it was the content. (Was Proust the first intersectionalist?) In any case, I turned away and did not come back for 15 years.\n\nAround 2005, a couple of years after my son was born, I returned to Proust ready to make my final ascent. By this time, the Shakespeare-inflected English title, Remembrance of Things Past, which Proust disliked, had been changed to In Search of Lost Time. And there were more translations to choose from: D. J. Enright's improvements on Terence Kilmartin's improvements on C. K. Scott Moncrieff (which have since been improved upon again and annotated by William C. Carter), and also Lydia Davis's fresh translation of the novel's first volume, Swann's Way.\n\nPlus there were new biographies of Proust, including one by Carter and one by Edmund White, and the monumental Marcel Proust by Jean-Yves Tadi\u00e9. There were books about reading Proust, including Andr\u00e9 Aciman's The Proust Project and de Botton's little volume. There was even a \"field guide,\" Roger Shattuck's Proust's Way, which includes a footnote telling you which sections are essential (and implying which you could skip and still say you'd really read Proust).\n\nI confess I studied that footnote, making smug mental check marks beside the passages I'd already traversed: Most of Swann's Way (the sections titled \"Combray\" and \"Swann in Love\"). Done. The Balbec section in In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower. Done. The death of the narrator's grandmother in The Guermantes Way. Done. In Sodom and Gomorrah, only the first 30 pages, about Charlus -- kind of done! -- and also the last 30, about Albertine, the woman with whom the narrator has a long, tortured relationship over the course of a few volumes. Well ...\n\nFeeling plucky, I abandoned Shattuck's list and plotted a confident new goal. No shortcuts for me. I would read the whole novel in time to tell my father, then nearly 90, before he died. (My father, a Proust fan, had read it all, twice, and saw it as one of life's great experiences.) Maybe bed was key. As Proust's own brother, Robert, wrote: \"The sad thing is that people have to be very ill or have broken a leg in order to have the opportunity to read In Search of Lost Time.\" Pffft. I didn't need a broken leg. I just needed a bed. Check.\n\nQuickly, however, I spied a new impediment. My paperback had fallen apart into two sections. Split down the middle like a shabby dime novel, right about where I'd been stuck, it was no longer monumental. To make matters worse, if I opened the book, the pages peeled off in protest, one by one. Again I turned away.\n\nFast-forward to 2011. Smartphones were now everywhere, and I noticed that the entirety of Proust's novel -- every volume but one in the original Moncrieff translation -- was available to download for free on my cellphone, an HTC Incredible, thanks to Project Gutenberg Australia. I quickly downloaded all seven volumes. Finally, in the fall, shortly before my father turned 95, I began where I left off, in Sodom and Gomorrah, reading Proust on my cellphone at night when everyone else in the house had gone to sleep.\n\nWhen I tell people this, they look at me like I have drowned a kitten. And when I tell them that not only did I finally finish all of Sodom and Gomorrah on my cellphone, but the rest of Proust's opus, too, and in time to tell my father, they back away from me very slowly.\n\nI do like books, real paper books. I have shelves full to prove it. But reading Proust on my cellphone was, I have to say, like no other reading experience I've had before or since. It was magical and -- dare I say it? -- Proustian in a very peculiar way.\n\nHere are my instructions. Make sure no one else is awake. Turn off the lights. Your windows can stay open. Now turn on your phone and begin reading. Repeat as necessary each night. Do not stop until the very last word of the very last volume, Time Regained.\n\nSoon you will see that the smallness of your cellphone (my screen was about two by three inches) and the length of Proust's sentences are not the shocking mismatch you might think. Your cellphone screen is like a tiny glass-bottomed boat moving slowly over a vast and glowing ocean of words in the night. There is no shore. There is nothing beyond the words in front of you. It's a voyage for one in the nighttime. Pure romance.\n\nIn a curious way, I think reading Proust on your cellphone brings out the fathomless something in the novel that Shattuck calls \"the most oceanic -- and the least read\" of 20th-century classics. It makes you feel like Jules Verne's Captain Nemo in his submarine, which is just right. As Benjamin Taylor notes in his biography, Proust: The Search, this is how Jean Cocteau described the writer at work in his bedroom, the cork-lined retreat on Boulevard Haussmann that Proust called \"a little bottle stop\" muffling the sounds of the world.\n\nAlthough Proust knew exactly where he was heading when he put together his masterwork -- he began with the first and last parts, then turned to the middle -- the same cannot be said for his readers, no matter how they tackle his text. They are at sea. This is what makes reading the novel such hard going, particularly in the middle. It is also what makes the experience extraordinary.\n\nKnowing where you are, physically, in a bound book keeps you from feeling this oceanic feeling quite so much. It keeps you grounded. But reading the book on your cellphone emphasizes your own smallness, your at-sea-ness, in relation to the vast ocean. There you are, moving along without any compass. How brave you are in your little dinghy, adrift and amazed.\n\nMy friends are amused: \"But how many times do you have to swipe through those tiny pages on your cellphone to get through a single Proust sentence?\" they ask. Sometimes many. Sometimes not even once. Even that record-breaking sentence, which stretches over two and a half pages in my old paperback, takes fewer than a dozen swipes. And turning the page, strange to say, is one of the nautical joys. Each finger drag is like an oar drawn through the water to keep the little glass-bottomed boat moving. After a while you're not even aware of rowing. You're simply looking through the glass into an endless ocean, moving silently, blindly forward.\n\nI really missed only one thing while sliding through Marcel Proust's novel, which follows the life of the narrator, Marcel, as he stumbles his way from childhood to middle age and finally finds the shape of his book (the very book we are reading) in his own human failings. What I lacked was the tactile sense of where on the page certain passages were, so I could return to them.\n\nBut here too I found compensations. If I could remember a phrase or even a word of the passage I wanted to go back to, I could search for it. Even better, I could send myself a message in a bottle and cast it out into the night. That is, when I came to a phrase I knew I would want to return to later, I could highlight it on my phone and paste it into an e\u2011mail. In the morning, I'd have a little postcard from Proust in my inbox, telling me where I'd been and what had impressed me in the vast ocean the night before.\n\nHere is the first postcard I sent, from Sodom and Gomorrah: \"I was therefore assured that I had slept profoundly, had dreamed the reverse of what had been in my thoughts overnight.\" It may not be the most spectacular sentence Proust ever wrote, but it had meaning for me, and still does. I love the simplicity, the counterintuitiveness, of this thought: You will not dream what you think about as you go to sleep. This Proustian idea has now become a bedtime practice for my son and me. We list the things we do not want to dream about in order to not dream about them. And it works. Proust (though he never read Freud and wasn't tempted to) knew dreams, and knew sleep.\n\nWhen I first began my cellphone adventure I was quite choosy, sending myself only the most Proustian or un-Proustian, funniest, freakiest, filthiest bits. In the fall of 2011, I found that I'd sent myself a passage from Sodom and Gomorrah about a nouveau riche woman who, just for fun, leaves turds in hotel rooms and cabs as a kind of \"keepsake\" for the help to clean up, commenting: \"There will always have to be the poor so that now I'm rich I can s -- t on them.\"\n\nOn another morning, I received a pithy little line from Charles Swann, the tragic Jewish sophisticate who shares some features with Proust himself. The line, from The Fugitive (formerly called The Sweet Cheat Gone), was: \"Quality doesn't matter, what I dread is quantity.\"\n\nI picked my passages carefully because, after all, sending yourself a message does interrupt your reading a little, much as writing a postcard interrupts a day on vacation. You have to step back, step out of yourself, think of the folks back home on solid ground.\n\nIt was strange to pick up these postcards in the morning, to see passages of Proust scattered in with the headlines, the ordinary news from friends, and the junk mail. On the morning of November 20, 2011, I was delighted to see that I had a postcard from Proust. I opened it up. It was a tidbit I'd sent myself the night before from his fifth volume, The Captive -- some dialogue between the narrator and his girlfriend Albertine:\n\n\"It had to be; you were unhappy here.\"\n\n\"No, indeed, I was not unhappy, it is now that I shall be unhappy.\"\n\n\"No, I assure you, it is better for you.\"\n\n\"For you, perhaps!\" ...\n\n\"Listen, Albertine, you say that you are happier here, that you are going to be unhappy.\"\n\nI remember reading this passage with my son looking over my shoulder and asking why there were so many unhappys on the page. He had picked up on something. The passage is perversely insistent both in language and in meaning. As the narrator ostensibly tries to convince Albertine that she is unhappy and that they should break up, his real motive is to make her love him more and never leave him.\n\nI felt a little queasy reading this maddening, mannered conversation cheek by jowl with the day's headlines: \"Libya Says It Has Captured Qaddafi's Son Seif al-Islam,\" \"Sectarian Strife in City Bodes Ill for All of Syria.\" But the full, and disconcerting, strangeness of the juxtaposition didn't strike me until, in the very last volume, I reached a passage about the spoiled saloniste Madame Verdurin as she read about the sinking of the Lusitania. In the middle of World War I, during butter shortages, she had somehow managed to secure herself a source of croissants. As she dipped one of her pastries\n\ninto her coffee, she arranged her newspaper so that it would stay open without her having to deprive her other hand of its function of dipping, and exclaimed with horror, \"How awful!\"\n\nThat was me 100 years later, dipping into my precious passage of Proust while watching the world implode.\n\nWhen I sensed I was nearing the far shore in my Proustian voyage, I stopped being so picky about my postcards. I paused more and more to post messages to myself, and toward the end of the last volume, Time Regained, I had to hold back from sending myself the whole book by e-mail. Many of my postcards concerned World War I, which was raging while Proust worked on parts of his novel.\n\nOn the night of January 20, 2012, I found myself feverishly cutting and pasting one screenful of text after another from the Proustian war front in Time Regained:\n\nDuring the raid of the evening before the sky was more agitated than the earth, but when it was over, the sky became comparatively calm but, like the sea after a tempest, not completely so. Aeroplanes rose like rockets into the sky to rejoin the stars and searchlights moved slowly across the sky divided into sections by their pale star dust like wandering Milky Ways.\n\nThe writing just kept building. There seemed to be no proper end. And then I saw that Proust had stopped reporting the look of war and had turned his attention to the fancy wartime parties. He put his thoughts, ranging both forward and back, into the mouth of the aristocratic dandy Charlus:\n\nThese f\u00eates represent what will be perhaps, if the Germans advance further, the last days of our Pompeii. It only needs the lava of some German Vesuvius (their naval guns are not less terrible than a volcano) to surprise them at their toilet and eternalise their gesture by interrupting it; children will later on be educated by illustrations of Mme Mol\u00e9 about to put the last layer of paint on her face before going to dine with her sister-in-law, or Sosth\u00e8ne de Guermantes finishing painting her false eyebrows ... What documents for future history! ... What similarities force themselves upon one.\n\nAnd so at last, I found myself staring into space, with my little glass-bottomed boat in my hand, looking forward and looking to the past, thinking about how far I'd come since I was first stuck in Sodom and Gomorrah and how the endless voyage was going to end very soon. My long moment of reading Proust had itself become a Proustian moment, a bittersweet mixing of past and present, real life and reading life, being adrift and being amazed. Perhaps that was because I had made my way to the end so slowly. Or perhaps it was because of my habit of reading in the night, and then looking back in the cold light of day to see exactly where I had been.\n\nSarah Boxer is a writer, illustrator, and cartoonist.

Betis were deserving victors of a thrilling contest at the Benito Villamarin where two galling Madrid errors cost them their place at the top of La Liga, with Barca now two points clear. A heavy touch from Sergio Ramos led to Sidnei's stunning opener for Betis and then Karim Benzema, who equalised with a penalty on the stroke of half-time, was at fault for their 82nd-minute winner.\n\nBenzema's misplaced pass in midfield allowed Cristian Tello to go clear and he held his nerve to give Betis their first victory in eight games that adds yet another twist to this season's back-and-forth title race.\n\n\"We lacked everything today,\" said Real coach Zinedine Zidane.\n\n\"It was our worst game of the season. We lacked energy, fluency, possession, aggression. It was a bad day and that can happen. I am responsible. We can't lose our heads but we can't be happy either.\"\n\nMadrid appeared to have taken a significant step forward, at least psychologically, by beating Barcelona 2-0 last weekend but this result undid all their good work at the Santiago Bernabeu while bringing defensive doubts swiftly back to the surface.\n\nBetis climb to 12th and put eight points between themselves and the bottom three.\n\nMadrid have now lost three out of their last four games and won only two from seven, a dip in form that has appeared even more charitable given Barca's own problems on and off the pitch.\n\nAfter a game at home to Eibar on Friday, Zinedine Zidane's side will travel to Manchester City in the Champions League but on this evidence their hopes of recovering their 2-1 home defeat from the first leg would seem faint at best.\n\nRamos will be suspended at the Etihad Stadium and his own poor run of form continued against Betis, where he was at fault for their first goal and then complicit in compounding Benzema's error for the second.\n\n\"We haven't played the way we trained all week,\" said Ramos. \"We have to be self-critical. And now we have to wait for those above us to slip up.\"\n\nEder Militao will likely come in for Ramos against City and he was given an outing at right-back in the absence of the ill Dani Carvajal while Marcelo was preferred to Ferland Mendy on the opposite side.\n\nGareth Bale was left out of the starting line-up for a fourth match running.\n\nBetis were the better side in the first half and might have taken the lead earlier had Marc Bartra not headed over from four yards or Thibaut Courtois not reacted quickly to push away Nabil Fekir's thundering shot.\n\nBut five minutes before half-time they finally broke through, aided by Ramos, who tried to dribble the ball out after Fekir's shot was blocked only for a heavy touch to allow the forward to retrieve.\n\nOff balance, Ramos bundled into Fekir and probably would have conceded a penalty had the loose ball not spilled to Sidnei, who instead hammered it into the top corner.\n\nDeservedly in front, Betis then went in level at the interval as Sidnei, perhaps with the adrenaline still pumping, fouled Marcelo in the box. Benzema drove into the bottom corner for only his third goal this year.\n\nBoth teams had chances to find a winner. A scintillating Betis break ended with Sergio Canales sending Joaquin through but after rounding Courtois he tried to square back to Canales when the net looked open. Luka Modric sprinted back and hacked away.\n\nMadrid enjoyed their own spell of pressure as Modric's shot from distance was saved and Mendy, on for Marcelo, curled onto the crossbar, helped on its way by the fingertips of Joel Robles.\n\nBut it was Betis that landed the decisive blow, again benefitting from a Madrid mistake. Benzema came deep and his pass inside was loose, persuading Ramos to dash out to intercept but he was beaten and left stranded.\n\nAndres Guardado put Tello through the gap and he sent Courtois diving towards one corner before sliding the ball into the other.","990":"Recipe: Easiest ever chocolate cake This throw-it-all-in-the-food processor chocolate cake is useful for many occasions.

If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nBecause the B cell receptor (BCR) is central to the development and activation of normal B cell subpopulations, its function is tightly controlled. We show that a novel tumor suppressor, KLHL14, is a subunit of a ubiquitin ligase that associates with the endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) machinery. KLHL14 promotes ubiquitylation of BCR subunits and decreases the stability of immature BCR glycoforms in the endoplasmic reticulum, thereby reducing BCR levels. Conversely, loss of KLHL14 promotes BCR-dependent NF-\u03baB activation and survival. These findings explain why KLHL14 inactivation occurs selectively in DLBCLs belonging to the MCD genetic subtype, since these tumors rely on BCR-dependent NF-\u03baB signaling for survival and are highly sensitive to the BTK inhibitor ibrutinib, which blocks this pathway.","995":"Regulatory CD8 T cells that recognize Qa-1 expressed by CD4 T-helper cells inhibit rejection of heart allografts There is increasing evidence that CD8+ regulatory T cells (CD8 Treg) can modulate the immune response in the context of autoimmune disease, infection, and cancer. Here we asked whether this regulatory mechanism might control the host response to transplanted heart allografts. We report that CD8 Treg that recognize Qa-1, the murine homolog of HLA-E, strongly inhibits host production of antibodies specific for the donor organ. Since the production of antidonor antibodies is currently a major barrier to successful transplantation, identification of this Qa-1\/HLA-E-dependent pathway may pave the way to approaches to this pressing clinical problem.\n\nInduction of longstanding immunologic tolerance is essential for survival of transplanted organs and tissues. Despite recent advances in immunosuppression protocols, allograft damage inflicted by antibody specific for donor organs continues to represent a major obstacle to graft survival. Here we report that activation of regulatory CD8 T cells (CD8 Treg) that recognize the Qa-1 class Ib major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a mouse homolog of human leukocyte antigen-E (HLA-E), inhibits antibody-mediated immune rejection of heart allografts. We analyzed this response using a mouse model that harbors a point mutation in the class Ib MHC molecule Qa-1, which disrupts Qa-1 binding to the T cell receptor (TCR)-CD8 complex and impairs the CD8 Treg response. Despite administration of cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) immunoglobulin (Ig), Qa-1 mutant mice developed robust donor-specific antibody responses and accelerated heart graft rejection. We show that these allo-antibody responses reflect diminished Qa-1-restricted CD8 Treg-mediated suppression of host follicular helper T cell-dependent antibody production. These findings underscore the critical contribution of this Qa-1\/HLA-E-dependent regulatory pathway to maintenance of transplanted organs and suggest therapeutic approaches to ameliorate allograft rejection.","996":"Replications provide mixed evidence that inequality moderates the association between income and generosity This article requires a subscription to view the full text.

As a twenty-something who stopped aging 80 years ago, Lively suggests several lifetimes of experience in a love story that ranges from wistful to hopeful, a romance whose female half understands its consequences.\n\nA pedantic narrator introduces Adaline under \"her current alias,\" Jenny, on New Year's Eve 2014, then backtracks to give a quasi-scientific explanation to the aging that stopped after an icy car wreck in the early 1930s.\n\nWidowed with a child, she begins to draw attention for her agelessness from law enforcement (in the paranoid McCarthy era). We watch her go underground -- changing names, changing jobs, investing her money in long-shot stocks so that she's never pressed for cash.\n\nNow she works in the San Francisco city archives, and she and her retirement-age daughter (a sparkling Ellen Burstyn) are the only ones who know her secret.\n\nThen a rich do-gooder of a suitor, Ellis (Michiel Huisman), fixes his eye on her. And her many polite rebuffs fail to deter him. Reluctantly, she falls for him.\n\nThe script cleverly has Adaline\/Jenny catch herself, blowing off a come-on as something she first heard \"from a young Bing Crosby ... type.\"\n\nThen Ellis gets a line that works. He quotes Leigh Hunt's poem \"Jenny Kiss'd Me.\"\n\nSay I'm weary, say I'm sad. Say that health and wealth have miss'd me.\n\nSay I'm growing old, but add, Jenny kiss'd me.\n\nAnd for an hour, \"Adaline\" is warm and charming, with a somber edge. She has buried generations of spaniels. She can't bear to bury another lover.\n\nHarrison Ford shows up for the third act as he and the ageless Kathy Baker play Ellis' parents. In a performance as affecting as any he has ever given, Ford lifts this romance in ways we never see coming.\n\nBut it's Lively's show, and she wears the period clothes and formalwear as easily as Adaline wears the burden of a body that never ages, even as the memory never forgets history learned, a language mastered or what love felt like when you last let yourself experience it.","1007":"Review: Kristen Stewart is mesmerizing in 'Clouds of Sils Maria' CLOUDS OF SILS MARIA\n\n\u22c6\u22c6\u22c6 out of four stars\n\nRating: R for language, brief nudity. Subtitled.\n\nTheater: Edina.\n\nIt is best to just let yourself get lost in the \"Clouds of Sils Maria\" for a little while. Beautiful as they snake through a valley in the Swiss Alps, they become maddening when they cloak the emotions and ambitions of an older actress (Juliette Binoche) and a rising young star.\n\nIn this richly imperfect piece about the vagaries of a life spent in film, French writer-director Olivier Assayas is most interested in the ways in which humans circle back to the people they've been, the past they've had. The film itself is a return to a creative collaboration he and Binoche began nearly three decades ago in their breakthrough, \"Rendez-vous.\"\n\nBinoche plays acclaimed actress Maria Enders, not yet comfortable in her middle-aged skin. Kristen Stewart is her personal assistant Valentine, a smart, opinionated right hand. Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz enters a bit later as the starlet, Jo-Ann Ellis, an edgy, unruly favorite of the tabloid press. Her presence on a project that would remake the film that made Maria a star -- with Jo-Ann stepping into Maria's role and Maria playing an older, desperate woman on the wane -- sets the stage for a great deal of soul-searching about movies, the mainstream, artistic value and fame.\n\nAs stirring as Binoche is, Stewart gives a mesmerizing performance that made her the first American actress to win a coveted C\u00e9sar award, France's version of the Oscar.","1008":"Reviews: 'Dior and I,' 'Girlhood' and 'Cheatin'' Dior and I\n\n\u22c6\u22c6\u22c6 out of four stars\n\nUnrated: Strong language and catwalk semi-nudity.

From the anxious expression in his eyes to his ongoing finger rubs across his distressed forehead, it's clear to see how difficult the new director of Dior's Paris fashion house finds it to move beyond a legacy. Director Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Tcheng follows Simons through his first two months of tense challenges and conflicts as the Belgian focuses on women's fashion, following a career in menswear at Jil Sander.\n\nClipping ahead briskly for 89 minutes, we encounter film-world fashion lovers including Marion Cotillard, Jennifer Lawrence, Sharon Stone and movie mogul Harvey Weinstein (such a fan that he was accused in April of groping a 22-year-old Italian model). From creating photo files rather than sketching dresses, to fitting them on lithe human pipe cleaners who march them across the catwalk, the film is a serious look at a business containing surprising amounts of tension. Beautifully filmed, with a superb modernist musical score by Ha-Yang Kim.\n\nCOLIN COVERT\n\nBill Plympton is a truly singular voice in the world of animation, a real-deal indie filmmaker. But there are times when his specific style is better in small doses. This typically bizarre, far left-of-center story about infidelity may be for hard-core fans only, as the vignette-like structure gives way to a sluggish pace and feels cobbled together. At times it comes to life, but for the most part it's a bit one-note and repetitive.\n\nERIK MCCLANAHAN\n\nTeenaged Marieme's bleak prospects growing up in a rough French suburb start looking up when she befriends three strong, buoyant girls who also happen to shoplift. In this beautifully executed rarity of a coming-of-age film -- its heroes are girls, and black -- boys play the supporting roles.\n\nKaridja Toure glows in the lead role, her face subtly revealing longing, confusion, bravado and uncertainty.

The paper presented the very first sliding law developed quantitatively from first principles, and involved the unconventional idealization of bed roughness using cubic 'tombstones' of rock. Since 1957, there has been a great deal of progress in understanding glacier sliding, but few studies, if any, have preserved the original tombstone geometry that was a hallmark of this first theory. The current study presents a partial reanalysis of the sliding process over a bed with tombstone obstacles using modern numerical methods. The result confirms the enduring applicability of Weertman's model as a pedagogical tool and motivates new questions about (1) folding flow near bedrock obstacles that invert normal ice stratigraphy, (2) the presence and role of stress singularities on sharp edges of bedrock, and (3) the validity of a presumption that regelation flow can be plug-like.","1010":"Roger Mayweather, Former Champion Boxer And Trainer, Dies At 58 | Boxing News Roger Mayweather, a two-time world champion turned trainer and uncle of unbeaten boxing great Floyd Mayweather, has died at the age of 58. \"My uncle was one of the most important people in my life inside and outside of the ring,\" said Floyd Mayweather, who was trained by his uncle for much of his illustrious career.

The former second-round pick from the 2015 NFL Draft of the Buffalo Bills out of Florida State explained his tough mindset throughout his professional journey.\n\nPer Rhiannon Walker in The Athletic:\n\n\"As the corner I know I am, I'm a great corner,\" Darby said. \"I had to battle obstacles and stuff like that, and at the end of the day, whether you're hurt or good, you still got to go out there and perform. You can't always have excuses. I know that I can be the person that I am, that I've shown.\"\n\nGiven the extreme athleticism and bursts of speed and agility today's wide receivers, the health of the team's secondaries is crucial, and Darby seeing limited time during the 2019 regular season is not indicative of any future performance he can bring to a franchise. Signing for less money on another single-year deal this offseason, Darby has to stay on the gridiron longer than the last two years (20 regular-season games combined) in order to secure a long-term deal with any club.\n\nDarby also combined for three interceptions in the last years along with 63 solo tackles.\n\nJUST IN: Video: Buccaneers' Shaq Barrett shows off his basketball skills Related TopicsEaglesRonald Darby","1015":"Ronaldinho Lawyers Push For Footballer's Release Over Fake Passport Scandal | Football News Lawyers for Brazilian football great Ronaldinho are trying to organize a hearing to get him temporarily released from detention for allegedly entering Paraguay with a fake passport, defense sources told AFP on Monday. Ronaldinho and his brother Roberto were arrested on Friday and held in pre-trial detention in Asuncion for entering Paraguay using forged documents. Sources close to his defense team told AFP the lawyers were trying to get the brothers a hearing on Tuesday in the hope of securing their temporary release.\n\nBrazilian press reported that the country's justice minister, Sergio Moro, had contacted Paraguayan authorities over Ronaldinho's case.\n\n\"Moro only called to obtain information on the case, because... the Brazilian government is following it,\" a justice ministry official said, denying that Brazil was trying to meddle in the case.\n\nRonaldinho's Brazilian lawyer Sergio Queiroz has previously insisted that the two-time world player of the year's detention was \"illicit, illegal and unlawful.\"\n\n\"Ronaldinho did not commit a crime because he did not know that the passport they gave him was faked,\" he said.\n\nThe brothers are spending a fourth day behind bars in the Paraguayan capital Asuncion, where late summer temperatures have soared to 40 degrees Celsius.\n\nQueiroz wants the pair to be released and allowed to return to their home country.\n\nHe said prosecutors originally agreed that the footballer had acted in good faith before a judge ordered their detention, which Queiroz described as unwarranted.\n\nRonaldinho, considered one of the greatest footballers of all time, was one of the stars of Brazil's 2002 World Cup win and played for European giants Barcelona Paris Saint-Germain and AC Milan, among others.\n\nHe and his brother arrived in Asuncion from Brazil on Wednesday and showed their passports to immigration police, who did not immediately notice any problem with the documents.\n\nHours later, when the passports were determined to be fake, investigators raided the hotel room Ronaldinho was staying in and seized the brothers' identity cards and travel documents.\n\nRonaldinho said the passports had been given to him by people who had invited him to attend conferences sponsored by charities working with disadvantaged children.\n\nA Brazilian businessman has also been arrested in connection with the fake passports, while two Paraguayan women have been placed under house arrest and Paraguay's migration director has resigned.\n\nQueiroz said the brothers were offered the passports \"to facilitate the possibility of doing business\" in Paraguay.\n\n\"The idea was to position Ronaldinho with brands and companies,\" he added.\n\nParaguayan president Mario Abdo on Monday revoked by decree the legal status of the foundation that invited Ronaldinho to the country.\n\nDefense lawyers for the \"Angelic Fraternity\" foundation's administrator, Dalia Lopez, acknowledged that she had requested official Paraguayan passports for the brothers but said she had no idea that those delivered were fakes.\n\nAuthorities have issued a warrant for her arrest.\n\nLopez's lawyers said the brothers had handed over $5,000 to \"accelerate the process to issue the passports\" and that she \"never suspected\" intermediaries dealing with the request would have submitted false information to authorities.\n\nHer lawyers also denied she had paid Ronaldinho to come to Paraguay or that she was involved in business with him.\n\nBut the arrested businessman, Wilmondes Sousa, claimed Lopez was responsible for making the fake passports.","1016":"Ronaldinho, Brother Not To Face Prosecution For Fake Passports | Football News Former Brazilian football star Ronaldinho and his brother were \"deceived\" and will not face prosecution for travelling to Paraguay on false documents, officials said Thursday. Prosecutor Federico Delfino said he had recommended not pursuing Ronaldinho and his brother Roberto de Assis Moreira. \"But on the condition of admitting committing the crime of which they are accused, in this case the use of false documents,\" he said. Ronaldinho's lawyer had earlier denied that he and his brother had used fake passports to enter Paraguay.\n\n\"We have proceeded to charge several people,\" Delfino told the press.\n\n\"Ronaldinho and his brother Roberto contributed relevant information to the investigation\" and were then removed from the case.\n\nThe brothers were acting in \"good faith\" in receiving the falsified Paraguayan documents, he said.\n\n\"The information that they provided is very useful in disrupting a criminal organization dedicated to the production of false documents,\" he said.\n\nBrazilian authorities withdrew Ronaldinho's passport in November 2018 after he failed to pay a $2.5 million fine for environmental damage incurred during the building of a property in Porto Alegre, in southern Brazil.\n\nThe World Cup winner and his brother were questioned for more than seven hours by the public prosecutor in Asuncion.\n\nRonaldinho had been invited to the Paraguayan capital by a foundation for needy children, and to promote his new book.\n\nThe 39-year-old and his brother went to the prosecutor's office in the morning alongside Paraguayan lawyer Adolfo Marin.\n\n\"They decided voluntarily to stay and submit themselves to the public prosecutor's investigations,\" said Marin.\n\nAccording to the inspector leading the investigation Gilberto Fleitas, Ronaldinho was given a fake passport by Brazilian businessman Wilmondes Sousa Lira, who has been arrested.\n\nMarin said Ronaldinho had told the public prosecutor that the documents in question were given to him a month ago in Brazil.\n\nFormer two-time world player of the year Ronaldinho and his brother were detained on Wednesday at their hotel.\n\nTheir fake documents were detected upon arrival at the Asuncion international airport, according to Delfino.\n\nThe former Barcelona, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain forward and his brother traveled using \"doctored Paraguayan passports and fake identity cards,\" Delfino said.\n\nHowever, Marin insisted that Ronaldinho had traveled with his own documents and was not subject to travel restrictions.\n\nMarin added that the two Brazilians faced no restrictions on their movements in Asuncion.\n\nInterior minister Euclides Acevedo earlier said Ronaldinho's celebrity would not spare him.\n\n\"As an authority, we couldn't ignore this irregularity,\" he said, adding that those who allowed Ronaldinho into the country would also be investigated.","1017":"Roster moves keep Vikings flexible Re-signing Kirk Cousins was the right decision by the Vikings, and other transactions are freeing up valuable salary cap space for moves that need to be made.\n\nFran Tarkenton, the greatest quarterback in Vikings history, said this week that when he considered all the quarterback options, there was no doubt that bringing back Kirk Cousins was going to be the right decision for the Vikings.\n\n\"I am a great fan of the quarterback that's up there, Kirk Cousins,\" Tarkenton said. \"He's a great young man, and I think he made tremendous strides last year. He really played great football for us last year. He is just such a great, great young man, and I am very fond of him. I think our quarterback position is in good shape.\"\n\nThe Vikings' decision to extend Cousins for two more years -- which will keep the quarterback in Minnesota through the 2022 season while paying him $21 million in 2020, $31 million in 2021 and $45 million in 2022 -- was the best option when you looked at the Vikings cap situation.\n\nThere was no doubt they wanted to free up more space for this season while also finding a way to keep Cousins, who has played some of the best football of his career for the Vikings.\n\nAnd maybe the biggest impact of the deal was that it helped give the team cap space to put a franchise tag on safety Anthony Harris -- who many publications graded out as one of the top five potential free agents in all of football.\n\nGeneral Manager Rick Spielman has never liked using the franchise tag, and it's only the third time the team has put it into use. Harris will make a little over $11 million this season if the team can't work out a long-term deal.\n\nThe fact is that Cousins has lived up to his contract. When you look at the landscape of the quarterback position around the NFL for the next three years, he is by far the best option to keep the team competing for the NFC North title, playoff victories and a shot at the Super Bowl.\n\nDiggs for picks\n\nThe second-biggest move of the week was the team's decision to trade Stefon Diggs and a seventh-round pick from this year's draft to the Bills for a first-, fifth- and sixth-round pick this season and a fourth-round pick in 2021.\n\nThis has been a big part of Spielman's career as Vikings general manager, doing everything he can to stockpile picks.\n\nHow the Vikings will replace Diggs, who averaged 925 yards and 73 receptions in his five years here, remains to be seen.\n\nBut for a team that needed to create cap space, the signing of Cousins and Harris, the trade of Diggs and the release of Xavier Rhodes and Linval Joseph meant the team had enough room to sign former Ravens defensive tackle Michael Pierce to a three-year, $27 million deal Wednesday.\n\nJust as importantly, they have six picks in the first four rounds of the draft.\n\nSpielman said recently that the team still believes they can find a lot of value for this season in the draft. And he'll continue to target ways to add mid- to late-round draft picks.\n\n\"We accumulate a lot of draft picks, especially through that fifth, sixth and seventh round. Our analytics do come into play,\" Spielman said. \"For example, if, say, one year there are 12 to 14 [draftable] receivers through the sixth and seventh round, and you know those guys are going to potentially be in [rookie] free agency, so you don't draft that position but you go ahead and sign those guys as a college free agent right after the draft and get aggressive in that area.\n\n\"If you take another position like cornerback, where there is only two or three left on the board and there's not going to be a lot in college free agency, then you may lean in that sixth, seventh round and take them in that position where you have them on the board and like them. Then you wait for the receiver position when college free agency begins because there's more quantity out there, but also quality too, otherwise they wouldn't be on our board.\"\n\nCan develop stars\n\nOne reason Spielman has liked this approach is because it gives the coaching staff a chance to develop hand-picked players. Look no further than Harris and Diggs.\n\nHarris went from undrafted rookie free agent to $11 million franchise player in only five seasons.\n\nDiggs was acquired in the 2015 draft after the Vikings traded the No. 137 pick to Atlanta for No. 146 and No. 185. Diggs was selected with the No. 146 pick.\n\n\"I always had the philosophy that if you have a swing at 10 guys in the sixth, seventh round, one, you don't have to compete with them when you get into free agency, you can draft them and have them. Then two, I do believe our coaches do such a great job when we identify guys that fit the physical traits that we're looking for and they like to play football, that you have the ability to maybe hit on some of those guys.\n\n\"I give a lot of credit to our scouts and the coaches, because they really do a lot of digging in this pre-draft process here. I try to get as many as I can but I'm not going to be able to see all those guys in the later rounds. Our area guys and our regional guys and [director of college scouting] Jamaal Stephenson and what he does leading that group, they have done a very good job finding and unearthing some talent in those later rounds.\"\n\nJottings\n\n* There are still sports being played around the globe. Former Timberwolves No. 2 overall pick Derrick Williams is playing for Fenerbahce in Turkey. He scored four points in a 84-75 win over Tofas in the Turkish Basketball Super League on Sunday. He is averaging 10.7 points, 3.9 rebounds and 2.0 assists over 14 games in league play this season. ... Also on the team is James Nunnally, who played 13 games with the Wolves during the 2018-2019 season and averaged 4.5 points per game.\n\n* How good is Gophers pitcher Max Meyer? This week, MLB draft analyst Keith Law picked him as the No. 6 overall prospect in the draft. That would place him near the draft positions of former Gophers Paul Molitor and Dave Winfield. Molitor went No. 3 overall to the Brewers in 1977 while Winfield went No. 4 overall to the Padres in 1973.\n\n* One of the bright spots from MLB spring training was that former Burnsville standout Sam Carlson, who was drafted in the second round by the Mariners in 2017, threw live batting practice for the first time in 32 months after an extremely difficult recovery from Tommy John surgery. \"I've been at points in the game where I've literally hated it, and I've thought, 'Am I ever going to throw again?'\u2009\" Carlson told MLB.com. \"I've had days where I've cried myself to sleep. It's been a lot. It really tested my character.\" Carlson rates as the No. 12 prospect in the Mariners farm system.","1018":"Royals' hopes ride with Twins, Nolasco DETROIT -- Of all the teams he's faced this season, Ricky Nolasco has been most effective against the Detroit Tigers. The Kansas City Royals are counting on that to continue tonight.\n\nNolasco owns a 2.03 ERA in two starts against the Tigers this season, including eight shutout innings at Target Field on Sept. 16. If he can do something similar tonight, when he faces Tigers rookie Kyle Lobstein, the AL Central race will come down to the season's final day -- or longer. The Royals trail Detroit by one game, and face the White Sox tonight in Chicago. If there is a tie, a one-game playoff will take place Monday, with the winner advancing to the division series, and the loser forced into the wild-card playoff game.\n\nSo there's actual pennant-race pressure in Comerica Park, and the Twins are enjoying their chance to take part, even from last place. \"I'm going to approach it as a must-win,\" said Kyle Gibson, who will start the finale on Sunday. \"You can learn a lot from seeing this kind of pressure.\"","1019":"Rumors Are Running Rampant That We Might Get an All-New Version of Wolverine in 'Wolverine 3' We've known for some time now that Logan and Xavier will be teaming up in the next Wolverine, but recent developments hint at a third member set to join the pack...though it hasn't been confirmed, there's the possibility X-23 might be making her debut on the big screen. Yes.\n\nFor those unaware, X-23 made her comic book appearance back in 2004 in the animated series X-Men: Evolution, where a team of mad scientists employed by the Weapon X program attempted to clone Wolverine.\n\n22 failures later, they got X-23. Biggest difference between these wolverines is that X-23 has a sole claw in each hand, but also claws that pop out of her feet.\n\nWhat do you think about the chances of X-23 appearing in Wolverine 3, and if she does will the movie do her character justice?","1020":"Ryan Saunders explains why red-hot Malik Beasley sat during 4th quarter of Wolves loss Malik Beasley had 19 points in the third quarter of Friday's 132-118 Timberwolves loss to the Magic.\n\nHe had 29 for the game and was shooting 14 of 21 - but Beasley didn't play in the fourth quarter.\n\nCoach Ryan Saunders said after the game it was his intent to get Beasley back in for the stretch run if the Wolves' second unit had cut into a large Orlando lead that was 19 headed into the fourth. When the Wolves couldn't get much closer, Saunders decided to keep Beasley on the bench, along with D'Angelo Russell, although Russell was having an off night (five points, 2 of 14 shooting).\n\n\"It got to a point when they're up a certain number, they're up big like that and Malik's been on the bench for however many minutes?\" Saunders said. \"You want to do right by him too and you don't want to put him in a situation where he's cold going out there.\"\n\nIt wasn't a huge deal to Beasley after the game, and he was more upset at himself and the way he started the game.\n\n\"Coach made a decision to see how our second unit is going to do,\" Beasley said. \"We didn't get a chance to make another run, so I didn't get to play the fourth quarter. Either way I got to start the game off ready to play.\"\n\nBeasley had played 28 minutes up to that point in the game, so Saunders likely wouldn't have Beasley play the entire fourth quarter under normal circumstances. Most likely Beasley would have played the final six to eight minutes, but Saunders decided to rest him when the Wolves didn't have a great chance of winning at that point in the game.\n\nClifford to the hospital\n\nOrlando coach Steve Clifford left the game during the third quarter and was taken to a local hospital, the Magic said. ESPN reported Clifford had two heart stents put in during 2013, but this issue seemed not to be heart related. ESPN also said the hospital visit was precautionary.\n\n\"Obviously prayers to coach Clifford,\" Saunders said. \"He's a guy that, as long as you bring him up, he's a guy that does not get enough credit in this league for how he coaches and what he does with teams. He's just a basketball lifer. I really hope he's OK. Thoughts go out to him.\"","1021":"S&P corta perspectiva de rating do Brasil para 'est\u00e1vel' por incertezas relacionadas ao Covid-19 S\u00c3O PAULO (Reuters) - A ag\u00eancia de classifica\u00e7\u00e3o de risco Standard and Poor's revisou para \"est\u00e1vel\", de \"positiva\", a perspectiva para o rating soberano do Brasil, citando os efeitos econ\u00f4micos e fiscais da pandemia do coronav\u00edrus.\n\nA S&P manteve a nota de cr\u00e9dito soberano de longo prazo em moeda estrangeira em \"BB-\".\n\nEm entrevista recente \u00e0 Reuters, a ag\u00eancia havia dito que estava avaliando a nota do pa\u00eds e que n\u00e3o necessariamente a deteriora\u00e7\u00e3o do clima econ\u00f4mico significaria que as perspectivas positivas do Brasil seriam reduzidas.\n\nA S&P calculou que o crescimento da economia ser\u00e1 \"severamente golpeado\" pela crise do Covid-19 e calculou que o d\u00e9ficit fiscal do governo bater\u00e1 os 12% do PIB em 2020, ante 6% em 2020.\n\nA ag\u00eancia disse que a vulnerabilidade fiscal do Brasil imp\u00f5e desafio ao governo de desenhar medidas para minimizar os efeitos da pandemia.

We hope the government can reconsider because we are part of the international supply chain,\" Kang said.\n\nMalaysia Retail Chain Association president Datuk Seri Garry Chua described the latest stimulus as \"much, much better\" and a \"big improvement\" from the previous package.\n\nHe said the the new stimulus was mainly geared towards micro enterprises, adding that bigger companies with a large workforce would still find it a struggle to keep afloat.\n\n\"Obtaining rental waivers from building owners in the private sector will remain difficult, even with the tax deductions the government is offering,\" said Chua.\n\nFederation of Malaysian Manufac-turers (FMM) president Tan Sri Soh Thian Lai said the RM7.9bil increa-sed allocation towards the Wage Subsidy Programme, which now stands at RM13.8bil, exceeded the RM12bil that FMM proposed in its appeal to the government following the announcement of the Prihatin Rakyat Economic Stimulus Package.\n\n\"We also note that the limit on numbers eligible for the wage subsidy has been increased for the large companies, from 100 to 200 per company now.\n\n\"However, we had hoped that the condition on a 50% reduction in revenue in order to qualify for the wage subsidy would have been removed as well as the ceiling of RM4,000,\" he added.\n\nSoh said while the moratoriums with regard to administrative dealings with the Companies Commission of Malaysia was a relief, FMM wanted a further waiver of interest for a moratorium period of six months.\n\n\"FMM also recommends that the moratorium be extended to trade facilities, overdraft and leasing,\" he added.\n\nMalay Chamber of Commerce Malaysia acting president Datuk Fauzi Hassan said most SMEs had no income during the MCO but still had payments to make.\n\nHe urged the government to allow leeway for businesses to resume operations to ensure that they could survive the tough economic period.","1024":"SR Applies ICT to SRT to Provide Smart and Safe Railroad Services SR (President Kwon Tae-myung) is raising the standard of railroad safety service by applying ICT (Information Communication Technology) to SRT (Super Rapid Train). By securing safety and improving service through ICT, SR is seeing improved air quality and less complaints and errors.\n\nSR signed a strategic business agreement with KT last year to implement a smart railroad service. It shares ICT and technologies and infrastructures needed to operate high-speed trains with KT and decided to implement a convenient and high-speed railroad service called \"5G Smart Station\".\n\nSR also established a traffic information monitoring system for its 32 railroad schedules. By using this system, SR can check any error in real time and make a swift response. SR has also reduced number of errors by preventing them through traffic information accumulated as big data. The number of errors involving SRT decreased from 17 cases in 2018 to 13 cases in 2019.\n\nSR installed AI CCTVs at Suseo Station. Previously, employees had to examine various locations at the station using CCTVs and check for any safety issue. However, AI can learn a situation where people approach tracks and inform employees at an operation center through real-time alarm. By establish an AI-based system, there was zero case of death from a fall involving SRT in 2019.\n\nSR introduced a real-time monitoring system to underground stations. Air blowers will operate once the air quality becomes bad while 39 large air purifiers will filter out dusts. As a result, air quality improved from 114ug\/m3 to 67ug\/m3 in just one year.\n\nBesides these systems, SR also introduced a disaster live broadcast system using AR (Augmented Reality) glass so that exchange of information between experts and on-site workers is easy and it is also providing a Sioux language text service for hearing-impaired people.\n\n\"We are pushing for Smart Station in order to implement safer and more convenient high-speed railroad service and to raise the social value of railroad.\" said President Kwon Tae-myung. \"We are going to establish a railroad service that is beyond imagination.\"\n\nStaff Reporter Yang, Seungmin | sm104y@etnews.com","1025":"Safeguarding intestine cells against enteropathogenic Escherichia coli by intracellular protein reaction, a preventive antibacterial mechanism This article requires a subscription to view the full text. If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nNew antibacterial strategies that circumvent existing mechanisms hold promise in the fight against drug-resistant bacteria. Here we present an antibacterial mechanism that safeguards cells and animals by shutting down an intracellular signal through a site-selective covalent peptide-protein reaction instead of acting on bacterium cells. The novelty of this work is multifold, including a cysteine- specific reaction at an SH3 domain of an adaptor protein in cells, selective blockage of the second SH3 domain of Nck but not the other two SH3 domains, and prevention of EPEC-induced infection in animals for at least 12 h by reactive peptide. Thus, this preventative mechanism differs significantly from the bactericidal actions of antibiotics.","1026":"Salmonella expresses foreign genes during infection by degrading their silencer This article requires a subscription to view the full text.

However, their expression often requires overcoming the silencing effects of the heat-stable nucleoid structuring (H-NS, also referred to as histone-like nucleoid structuring) protein, which binds to AT-rich foreign DNA in enteric bacteria. We establish that Salmonella enterica degrades H-NS when inside macrophages and that the resulting decrease in H-NS abundance de-represses foreign genes, even those not bound by antisilencing DNA-binding proteins. Conservation in the amino acid sequences of both the protease degrading H-NS and H-NS itself suggests that enteric bacteria share the uncovered strategy to express foreign genes silenced by H-NS.","1027":"San Joaquin County Inmate Found In Possession Of Meth During Search SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY (CBS13) -- A San Joaquin County inmate is facing additional felony charges after 5.4 grams of meth were found in her cell on Saturday.\n\nInmate Amber Austin was arrested in Ripon last week on charges of possessing a stolen vehicle after a license plate reader detected the vehicle.

S., Mpls.) quietly closed its doors.\n\n\"It has been a pleasure serving you!\" said a posting on Facebook. \"We will miss you. But we wish you a Happy New Year from the bottoms of our hearts.\"\n\nThe charming, forward-thinking restaurant had a good run, opening in 2007 in the first floor of a restored 19th-century structure near the Guthrie Theater. From the beginning there was a familiar face in the cozy stone-and-timber dining room: co-owner Michael Kutscheid, a longtime host-with-the-most presence in Twin Cities restaurants.\n\nAlthough the opening chef was Gary Stenberg, he was quickly replaced by Patrick Atanalian, a French expat with New French Cafe, Loring Cafe and other top-shelf names on his resume.\n\nAtanalian remained until late 2017, a decade-long tenure of turning out whimsical, quirky and seasonally-minded fare in what was surely one of the smallest commercial kitchens in the five-state area.\n\nA draw - and a role model for other Twin Cities restaurants - was the kitchen's five-course, $35 tasting menu, which Atanalian used as a laboratory for his ever-changing menus. Atanalian (who spent part of 2019 breathing new life into the Normandy Kitchen before moving on from that gig) made a cameo appearance in the Sanctuary kitchen on New Year's Eve for that final dinner service.\n\nIn an everything-old-is-new-again move, Stenberg returned to the restaurant after Atanalian's departure. The restaurant's final chef was Marc Paavola, a talented veteran of the former Craftsman.\n\nThe closing is the second in the neighborhood in recent weeks. The lights went out at 14-year-old Spoonriver on Dec. 21. It will be replaced by a collaborative effort between the Birchwood Cafe and the Minnesota Farmers Union. No word on what will happen with the Sanctuary space.","1029":"Sandeep Patil Questions Ajinkya Rahane's Batting Approach, Asks Who Will Score Runs | Cricket News Sandeep Patil, former India cricketer and chief selector, has slammed Ajinkya Rahane for adapting an over-cautious approach during the recently concluded Test series in New Zealand, which India lost 0-2. In an interview with the Times of India, Sandeep Patil said that India's Test vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane is trying to prove a point that he was a Test specialist and in doing so, he just tried to occupy the crease during the New Zealand tour. The former India batsman questioned who will score runs if a player is just going to occupy the crease. He also added that if the player wants to just occupy the crease, he should call a security guard.\n\n\"I heard about this (batting slowly) when he was playing for Mumbai this season. This happens due to fear of failure. He has led India, he's got a tremendous overseas record, but all that's history. Now that he's been labelled only as a Test player, been out of India's limited-overs team, human nature is such that one wants to establish himself as a Test specialist. He's trying to prove a point,\" Patil was quoted as saying by the Times of India.\n\n\"By doing that, you try to show that I'll be technically correct. I'll try to occupy the crease. If you want to just occupy, you can call a security guard! Who'll score the runs?\"\n\nThe 63-year-old also questioned head coach Ravi Shastri and batting coach Vikram Rathour's role in helping a batsman.\n\n\"If Rahane isn't understanding this, what is Shastri, and the batting coach doing? If one batsman goes into a shell, the others follow, and the team suffers. Those who bats after such batsmen feel that the bowling is too good,\" he said.\n\nEven India captain Virat Kohli had a torrid time with the bat in the two-match Test series in New Zealand as he could only manage to score a total of 38 runs in four innings.","1030":"Sanjay Bangar Not Taking Up Bangladesh Cricket Board's Coaching Offer | Cricket News Former India batting coach Sanjay Bangar has decided against taking the Bangladesh Cricket Board's offer to become its Test team's consultant citing his personal and professional commitments. Bangar was offered to coach Bangladesh batsmen in red-ball cricket eight weeks ago but he could not take up the offer as he signed a two-year contract with Star Sports in the interim. \"They offered me the position eight weeks ago. But in the interim, I finalised my contract with Star which gave me the opportunity to balance out my personal and professional commitments. However, I look forward to working with BCB in the future,\" Bangar told PTI.\n\nFormer South Africa batsman Neil McKenzie is primarily working with the Bangladesh side for the shorter formats.\n\nBangar was with the Indian team from 2014 to 2019 and was replaced by Vikram Rathour at the start of the home season in September. The West Indies tour, which took place after the World Cup, was his last assignment with the Indian team.\n\nBangar was the only one whose contract with the Indian team was not renewed with head coach Ravi Shastri, bowling coach Bharat Arun and fielding coach R Sridhar retaining their roles. Bangar has been busy commentating on the game ever since he was replaced by Rathour.\n\nThe 47-year-old played 12 Tests and 15 ODIs for India between 2001 and 2004.\n\n\"We have spoken with Bangar (for Test batting consultant) but nothing is finalised yet,\" BCB chief executive Nizamuddin Chowdhury told reporters in Dhaka earlier on Wednesday.\n\n\"We are negotiating with a few others as well.

If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nPhylogenetic trees describe both the evolutionary process and community diversity. Recent work, especially on bacterial sequences, has established that, despite their apparent complexity, they exhibit two unexplained broad structural features which are consistent across evolutionary time. The first is that phylogenetic trees exhibit scale-invariant topology. The second is that the backbones of phylogenetic trees exhibit bursts of diversification on all timescales. Here, we present a coarse-grained model of niche construction coupled to simple models of speciation that recapitulates both the scale-invariant topology and the bursty pattern of diversification in time. These results show, in principle, how dynamical scaling laws of phylogenetic trees on long timescales may emerge from generic aspects of the interplay between ecological and evolutionary processes.","1033":"Schedule and more info for Saturday's Slipknot-led Northern Invasion in Somerset Somerset Amphitheater is getting a jump on the summer concert season this upcoming weekend with what will actually wind up being one of this year's biggest music festivals near the Twin Cities: The inaugural Northern Invasion metal fest is taking place at the western Wisconsin rock and tubing hub on Saturday with Slipknot, Five Finger Death Punch, Halestorm, Anthrax and Volebeat for its top-dog acts.\n\nTickets for the event are officially sold out, even including VIP packages. That's no surprise, given how much the fest harks back to the concert glory days of the former Float-Rite park location, which hosted a lot of Ozzfests and X Fests in the 1990s. The site was made over under new ownership in 2011 with more\/better camping grounds and other improvements. Heck, there are even flush toilets out there now. You know how fussy those metalheads can be.\n\nSomerset regulars Slipknot already hosted their own Knotfest there in 2012. However, the Des Moines metal vets haven't been around our neck of the woods since releasing their well-received fifth album, \".5: The Gray Chapter,\" which was inspired by the death of bassist Paul Gray (who lived in Minneapolis for a spell). They're touring without drummer Joey Jordison nowadays, too. Anthrax, meanwhile, has regrouped with its heyday singer Joey Belladonna. And one band that was supposed to be playing Northern Invasion without its original singer, Live, isn't even on the schedule anymore -- probably at no great loss in this case.\n\nUntil the new bridge spanning the St. Croix River is completed, the easiest way to get to Somerset from the Twin Cities is to take Interstate 94 east across the river to Wisconsin Highway 35-N. Three different route options are listed on the venue's website.\n\nNorthern Invasion is owned and promoted by Danny Wimmer Presents and AEG Live as part of a network of eight different festivals taking place around the country this month, also including Rock on the Range in Columbus, Ohio, and Rocklahoma near Tulsa.\n\nOrganizers released the schedule for our local fest this afternoon.

The brain is an extraordinarily complex organ, consisting of almost 100 billion cells - known as neurons - each connected to 10,000 others, yielding some ten trillion nerve connections.\n\nWe have made a great deal of progress in understanding brain activity, and how it contributes to human behaviour. But what no one has so far managed to explain is how all of this results in feelings, emotions and experiences. How does the passing around of electrical and chemical signals between neurons result in a feeling of pain or an experience of red?\n\nThere is growing suspicion that conventional scientific methods will never be able answer these questions. Luckily, there is an alternative approach that may ultimately be able to crack the mystery.\n\nFor much of the 20th century, there was a great taboo against querying the mysterious inner world of consciousness - it was not taken to be a fitting topic for \"serious science\". Things have changed a lot, and there is now broad agreement that the problem of consciousness is a serious scientific issue. But many consciousness researchers underestimate the depth of the challenge, believing that we just need to continue examining the physical structures of the brain to work out how they produce consciousness.\n\nThe problem of consciousness, however, is radically unlike any other scientific problem. One reason is that consciousness is unobservable. You can't look inside someone's head and see their feelings and experiences. If we were just going off what we can observe from a third-person perspective, we would have no grounds for postulating consciousness at all.\n\nOf course, scientists are used to dealing with unobservables. Electrons, for example, are too small to be seen. But scientists postulate unobservable entities in order to explain what we observe, such as lightning or vapour trails in cloud chambers. But in the unique case of consciousness, the thing to be explained cannot be observed. We know that consciousness exists not through experiments but through our immediate awareness of our feelings and experiences.\n\nSo how can science ever explain it? When we are dealing with the data of observation, we can do experiments to test whether what we observe matches what the theory predicts. But when we are dealing with the unobservable data of consciousness, this methodology breaks down. The best scientists are able to do is to correlate unobservable experiences with observable processes, by scanning people's brains and relying on their reports regarding their private conscious experiences.\n\nBy this method, we can establish, for example, that the invisible feeling of hunger is correlated with visible activity in the brain's hypothalamus. But the accumulation of such correlations does not amount to a theory of consciousness. What we ultimately want is to explain why conscious experiences are correlated with brain activity. Why is it that such activity in the hypothalamus comes along with a feeling of hunger?\n\nIn fact, we should not be surprised that our standard scientific method struggles to deal with consciousness. As I explore in my new book, Galileo's Error: Foundations for a New Science of Consciousness, modern science was explicitly designed to exclude consciousness.\n\nBefore the \"father of modern science\" Galileo Galilei, scientists believed that the physical world was filled with qualities, such as colours and smells. But Galileo wanted a purely quantitative science of the physical world, and he therefore proposed that these qualities were not really in the physical world but in consciousness, which he stipulated was outside of the domain of science.\n\nThis worldview forms the backdrop of science to this day. And so long as we work within it, the best we can do is to establish correlations between the quantitative brain processes we can see and the qualitative experiences that we can't, with no way of explaining why they go together.\n\nMind is matter\n\nI believe there is a way forward, an approach that's rooted in work from the 1920s by the philosopher Bertrand Russell and the scientist Arthur Eddington. Their starting point was that physical science doesn't really tell us what matter is.\n\nThis may seem bizarre, but it turns out that physics is confined to telling us about the behaviour of matter. For example, matter has mass and charge, properties which are entirely characterised in terms of behaviour - attraction, repulsion and resistance to acceleration. Physics tells us nothing about what philosophers like to call \"the intrinsic nature of matter\", how matter is in and of itself.\n\nIt turns out, then, that there is a huge hole in our scientific world view - physics leaves us completely in the dark about what matter really is. The proposal of Russell and Eddington was to fill that hole with consciousness.\n\nThe result is a type of \"panpsychism\" - an ancient view that consciousness is a fundamental and ubiquitous feature of the physical world. But the \"new wave\" of panpsychism lacks the mystical connotations of previous forms of the view. There is only matter - nothing spiritual or supernatural - but matter can be described from two perspectives. Physical science describes matter \"from the outside\", in terms of its behaviour, but matter \"from the inside\" is constituted of forms of consciousness.\n\nThis means that mind is matter, and that even elementary particles exhibit incredibly basic forms of consciousness. Before you write that off, consider this. Consciousness can vary in complexity. We have good reason to think that the conscious experiences of a horse are much less complex than those of a human being, and that the conscious experiences of a rabbit are less sophisticated than those of a horse. As organisms become simpler, there may be a point where consciousness suddenly switches off - but it's also possible that it just fades but never disappears completely, meaning even an electron has a tiny element of consciousness.\n\nWhat panpsychism offers us is a simple, elegant way of integrating consciousness into our scientific worldview. Strictly speaking it cannot be tested; the unobservable nature of consciousness entails that any theory of consciousness that goes beyond mere correlations is not strictly speaking testable. But I believe it can be justified by a form of inference to the best explanation: panpsychism is the simplest theory of how consciousness fits in to our scientific story.\n\nWhile our current scientific approach offers no theory at all - only correlations - the traditional alternative of claiming that consciousness is in the soul leads to a profligate picture of nature in which mind and body are distinct. Panpsychism avoids both of these extremes, and this is why some of our leading neuroscientists are now embracing it as the best framework for building a science of consciousness.\n\nI am optimistic that we will one day have a science of consciousness, but it won't be science as we know it today. Nothing less than a revolution is called for, and it's already on its way.","1035":"Seasonal hysteresis of surface urban heat islands This article requires a subscription to view the full text. If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nUrban heat islands represent a major threat to public health with implications for energy consumption and climate adaptation policies. A ubiquitous feature in the seasonality of surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) is distinctive hysteretic cycles between urban and rural surface temperature that still await a general explanation. A coarse-grained model of SUHI serving as a minimalist representation of urban-rural seasonal dynamics based on urban scaling laws and mass\/energy conservation principles is proposed to explore this hysteretic behavior. It is shown that such hysteresis is controlled by time lags between energy (radiation\/temperature) and water (rainfall) availability. The model largely explains the observed seasonal patterns in amplitude and looping direction and provides general guidance for SUHI reduction across cities and climates.","1036":"Seattle's School System Has Begun Dismantling Its Gifted Programs As if to demonstrate why school choice matters, Seattle's education system is purposefully dismantling a program to serve its gifted students at one of its schools -- and completely ignoring parents' wishes in the process.\n\nIn January, the Seattle School Board voted to partner with a nonprofit to improve the curriculum of Washington Middle School. Unfortunately, these changes are coming at the expense of the Highly Capable Cohort (HCC) program, an extremely popular gifted program that lets students who score well on standardized tests participate in specialized classes in which they study material several grade levels higher than the ordinary curriculum.\n\nThe program has historically been dominated by white and Asian students, to the frustration of folks who want to see more diversity in such offerings. But rather than working to improve access for minorities, some school leaders -- including Superintendent Denise Juneau -- decided that the gifted classes are a form of \"redlining,\" which is the historical practice of not granting mortgages to people who live in minority communities. The Seattle Public School District thus wants to kill off the HCC program. The changes at Washington Middle School are just the start, district leaders hope.\n\nAs The Stranger's Katie Herzog reports, the parents of minority kids in the program are particularly unhappy at the prospect of their children going back to regular classes. \"My request is that you please consider the disservice you would be doing to the minorities that are already in the HCC program,\" Herzog heard one father testify to the school district. \"The program does more for black children, particularly black boys, than it does for their peers.\"\n\nOther minority parents told Herzog similar stories about the life-saving potential of gifted classes. \"Their kids...get bored in the general ed classroom, and then [they] end up being tagged as disruptive when what they need is just accelerated curriculum,\" Herzog wrote.\n\nOnly 1.6 percent of the HCC program's participants are African-American. But for those kids' parents, that's a reason to expand it, not end it. One parent told Herzog that Juneau hadn't talked to minority parents who have kids in the program to get their feedback. Instead, School Board Director Chandra Hampson claimed that these families were being \"tokenized\" and used by white people to maintain the program.\n\nSeattle Times columnist Danny Westneat is baffled by those at the school district who would rather eliminate a successful program than try to enlarge its reach. He cites one school administrator who reportedly told a parent that the program leads to \"opportunity hoarding\" by the privileged.\n\nThat kind of zero-sum argument can lead to a dark place. \"Undoing such hoarding 'is delicate territory,' the scholar Richard Reeves explained a few years back, because 'improving rates of upward relative mobility from the bottom comes with a sting in the tail: it requires more downward mobility from the top,'\" Westneat wrote. Yet \"educational opportunity isn't a capped resource (at least it doesn't have to be). In the HCC program, for example, there aren't a fixed number of slots, like in, say, admission to a selective college.\"\n\nIt should be horrifying to any parent that there are school districts run by bureaucrats who think educational equality means not just improving opportunities and outcomes for students who are behind the curve but also impeding students who are moving faster than average. What's more, this isn't happening just in Seattle. Reason's Matt Welch has written about a similar fight in New York City to abolish gifted programs at public schools.\n\n\"This is a debate about what is the role and purpose of a public school district,\" Seattle parent Chun Ng told Westneat. \"Is it to get every kid to a basic standard? Or is it to foster the potential of every kid? What the district is proposing here is like Medicaid, sort of a broad safety-net approach. It's understandable because, like with Medicaid, they have people falling through the cracks. But if you want more than that, I guess you have to go to private school.\"\n\nAnd that, ultimately, is why school choice is so important. Parents should be able to respond to Juneau's blunt dismissal of their children's needs by taking their business elsewhere.","1037":"Securing timelines in the ancient Mediterranean using multiproxy annual tree-ring data Edited by Mehmet \u00d6zdo\u011fan, Istanbul Universitesi, Istanbul, Turkey, and approved February 24, 2020 (received for review October 7, 2019)\n\nThis study demonstrates how different lines of evidence from tree rings in widely spread growth locations can combine to fix an approximately dated tree-ring record from the East Mediterranean Bronze-Iron Age to an exact calendar-dated range. This tree-ring record is of high importance for regional chronology and spans the time period in which the major volcanic eruption of Thera (Santorini) occurred. Exact dating of this eruption is important because it provides a prominent marker horizon through which ancient timelines of the East Mediterranean, Egypt, and the Levant can be synchronized. Chemical analysis of the dated tree-ring sequence identifies a chemical change in their growth environment around 1560 BC, which while requiring further substantiation, may be evidence of the Thera eruption.","1038":"See the bizarre, silly-string-like ocean creature that's blowing scientists' minds They found something flabbergasting in the deep sea: a crazy-long ocean creature called a siphonophore.

The confusion, the frustration, the disappointment.\"\n\nAugustus' tone conveyed her disappointment, not anger. Still, her words were a stark contrast to what was said two weeks ago when it was announced she was leaving. Augustus wrote a heartfelt message on Instagram that was as sentimental and happy look back at her 14 seasons, while Lynx coach\/GM Cheryl Reeve said, \"We wish she was not leaving. But we're happy if that's what she wants at this time.\"\n\nAugustus said at the outset of the video that she wanted to clear up two misconceptions: That she asked for a max contract and\/or signed with the rival Sparks to spite the Lynx. She said neither was the case. She described negotiations with the Lynx in terms of a relationship.\n\n\"It was almost like when you get in an argument with your spouse, and someone says something in the argument and you didn't know they felt like that,\" she said. \"It's basically about how I felt going into negotiations ... and the fact that I even had to, like, after 14 years even open the door for other teams to talk. In 14 years I never opened the door. People knew not to even come talk to me because I was going to back to the Lynx. ... But the negotiations were going so 'left' that for me I had to open the door to other teams.\"\n\nAugustus, who is 11th all-time in scoring in WNBA history and won four championships with the Lynx, was limited by a knee injury to just 12 games last season -- scoring just 3.8 points per game on 31.3% shooting. She said she didn't anticipate a lot of teams would be interested in her as a free agent, but that she found several suitors -- including the Sparks.\n\nAt first, Augustus said, she was negotiating with Los Angeles in hopes of spurring the Lynx to keep her. But as time went on, the breakdown with the Lynx combined with the chance to experience Los Angeles and compete for a championship compelled her to sign with the Sparks.\n\nShe called the whole process \"probably the most stressful situation I've dealt with.\"","1040":"Selena Quintanilla's Widower Says He Was Not Consulted About New Netflix Series A new series about the life of the Queen of Tejano, Selena Quintanilla, is heading to Netflix...but not without some controversy.

So I'm pledging to run a series of photography tutorials for those of us affected by these measures.\n\nThe idea behind this series of tutorials is to shoot a different style of photography in each room of my house. The reason being that we all have different housing statuses and I don't want anybody to be excluded. So whether you're confined to one bedroom in a house share, live with a partner in an apartment, have a growing family in a semi-detached house, or have oodles of space in your mansion, there's going to be at least one article for you.\n\nI want to make these tutorials as inclusive as possible, so I'll be making sure they can be done on a minimal budget, with items we already have in the house or can easily make in a DIY fashion. So let's get started with our first tutorial: product photography in the living room.\n\nTo keep things as simple as possible I'm going to use one light, one product and my camera on a tripod. I've stripped it right back, discounting backdrops, photo boards, flashguns, flags, or scene dressing. There should be no reason (short of not owning a flashlight) that you can't replicate this in your own home. However, if you find that you can't do this for whatever reason, reach out in the comments below and I'll be sure to take a look and help out.\n\nSet up Your Scene\n\nThe Nikon D750 was on the tripod to keep the camera still during exposure. The SLR, my product, was placed on the sofa, near the edge to allow the background to fall out of focus.\n\nI grabbed my flashlight and an old SLR then set myself up on the couch. My plan was to light up sections of the camera with my flashlight during a long exposure, similar to light painting techniques, to give the effect of shooting in a studio with big softboxes and complicated flag set-ups. I put my Nikon D750 on a tripod as I needed it to remain completely still during the long exposure, to keep things sharp. Make it Dark\n\nI closed the curtains to make it dark enough for a longer exposure without having extra ambient sunlight, lighting my scene.\n\nMy aim here was to only capture light from the flashlight, leaving the background to drop into darkness, so I drew the curtains. That way, the bright light from the flashlight would overpower the ambient light in the shot and isolate the SLR from the background. Shoot in Manual Mode\n\nA narrow aperture and low ISO allows me to get a long shutter speed of three seconds to complete my light painting.\n\nIn manual mode, I chose a narrow aperture of f\/16 in a bid to keep things dark enough so that I could use an exposure length of a few seconds without overexposing my image. Unfortunately, that wasn't quite enough so I dropped my ISO down below 100. On Nikon cameras, this displays as Lo and I chose the lowest on my D750: Lo1.0. This gave me a shutter speed of around three seconds, just enough time to maneuver my flashlight.\n\nBonus tip: engage the self-timer or exposure delay mode to give yourself enough time to get in position with the flashlight, and stop any camera movement before your long exposure to keep things sharp. Alternatively, you could use an external remote shutter release.\n\nExperiment With the Light\n\nMoving the flashlight in a semi-circular arc around the SLR during a three second exposure, I gave the impression the product was lit with more than one light.\n\nIt took me several attempts to get happy with the position of the flashlight on the camera. Eventually, I settled for a circular pass over the top of the SLR, starting at the bottom-left and drawing a semi-circular arch around the SLR until I finished at the bottom-right, shining the light down onto it as I went. Take Multiple Shots\n\nKeep the camera and tripod steady while you shoot, and try not to reposition. I took several shots of the SLR and highlighted different sections of the camera. Because I kept everything still, that meant I could composite the images together in editing software later and highlight certain areas of the product by masking them in. Something which I'll be demonstrating in the next part to this tutorial.\n\nUsing a little light painting and by blocking out sunlight we can achieve a simple, stylish product shot with just one flashlight\n\nThe finished product. With a narrow aperture, long shutter speed and low ISO I've managed to create a shot that looks like it's lit with multiple lights, instead of just one flashlight. You can't even tell it's just taken on my couch as the background is nice and dark.\n\nTo all you professional product photographers out there: this is intended to be a quick and simple approach to product photography -- so you might find it a little easy. So I intend you to scale these to your skill level. Therefore, I challenge you to find some awesome ways to enhance the end result. If you do, please share your experiments down in the comments below.\n\nThe second part to this tutorial will be on editing three separate, light painted shots together in editing software, by using a combination of blending modes and masks to reveal more detail and texture to this product photograph, so be sure to check back soon for that update. Also, come back regularly to find more content from me in this self-isolation series for fresh projects to try. I'm going to cover topics such as portraiture, macro photography, nature, food, abstract, astrophotography, and time-lapse. Plus, I've yet to venture into the kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, and hallway. I don't have a garden but I will be shooting from my window to prove you don't have to have a garden to partake in these tutorials.","1042":"Senior Hezbollah commander found dead with gunshot and stab wounds: Reports Senior Hezbollah counterintelligence official Muhammad Ali Yunis has reportedly been killed in southern Lebanon.\n\nThe body of Yunis, who closely collaborated with Hezbollah's ally Iran, was discovered over the weekend inside a car where he had been shot and stabbed, according to Haaretz.

The 16-year-old Shafali (744 points) had grabbed the top spot at the end of the league stage of the just-concluded women's T20 World Cup in Australia which the hosts won for an unprecedented fifth time. Australia opener Beth Mooney, who hit 78 not out in the final on Sunday, jumped two spots to number one with 762 points to her kitty.\n\nMooney scored 259 runs at an average of 64 in six innings, the highest aggregate by anyone at a single edition of the competition and was named Player of the Tournament. She has topped the rankings for the first time in her career.\n\nNew Zealand's Suzie Bates (750 points) remained in second position in the list that also features the Indian duo of Smriti Mandhana and Jemimah Rodrigues in the top ten.\n\nWhile the India vice-captain Mandhana, who had a forgetful tournament, moved down a spot to be ranked seventh, Rodrigues remained static on ninth.\n\nMooney's opening partner Alyssa Healy has risen two slots to fifth position after a blistering 39-ball 75 in the final against India while South Africa's Laura Wolvaardt has advanced 13 slots to reach a career-best 31st place after a valiant 27-ball 41 in their semifinal against Australia.\n\nIndia's Deepti Sharma advanced 10 slots to reach 43rd position among batters and is among the top five all-rounders for the first time.\n\nDeepti, Radha Yadav and Poonam Yadav occupied the sixth, seventh and eighth sports respectively in the bowlers ranking led by England's Sophie Ecclestone.\n\nAustralia's Megan Schutt and South African Shabnim Ismail occupy the second and third place respectively among bowlers.\n\nWhile Australia left-arm spinner Jess Jonassen reached a career-best 728 points and fifth place, her best position since a career-best fourth ranking in November 2017.

Another women's cricket veteran Diana Edulji called for \"introspection\" following the team's crushing loss in the T20 World Cup final against Australia, while former coach Tushar Arothe slammed the decision to send Tania Bhatia at number three. The occasion got the better of the Indian team once again as it lost the final by a whopping 85-run margin in Rajkot on Sunday.\n\nBoth Shantha and Diana took solace in the performance of 16-year-old opener Shafali Verma and the consistent showing from the bowlers while the star batters disappointed.\n\n\"I am very disappointed that such high calibre batters like Smriti, Jemimah, Harman did not click at all. It was a consistent failure of Harman, Smriti, Jemimah and Veda,\" Shantha told PTI after India's heavy loss in their maiden final.\n\n\"Shafali was the only one who made significant contributions while the others just chipped in which is not good enough to win a world title.\"\n\nQuestions are being raised about Harmanpreet the captain as well as the batter. Under her leadership, India had lost in the semi-finals in the 2018 edition in the West Indies. Her scores in Australia read 4, 15, 1, 8 and 2.\n\n\"I am sure she will know when to give up captaincy and it is time for her review her captaincy. She is a mature person because she definitely is needed in the team much more as a batter than captain, especially in T20s.\n\n\"It is worth pondering over. With new selectors, new think tank coming in after the World Cup (this can be reviewed),\" said the 66-year-old.\n\nDiana, who had criticised the team's fitness in the preceding tri-series, said a proper introspection should follow the defeat in the final.\n\n\"Let us not be too harsh on them. They had a good run. We broke the semifinals jinx. The loss has shown that T20 is not our forte, our forte is ODI cricket.\n\n\"It is time for good some introspection on the strengths and weaknesses and put it into practice because the 50 over World Cup is just around the corner (next year),\" said Diana, who also captained India and so did Shantha.\n\nBesides the failure of the star batters, running between wickets and fielding let the team down. Shafali, whose only failure came in the final, was instrumental in India's entry into the final.\n\n\"There are lots of positives despite the loss. Shafali was brilliant and spinners and lone pacer Shikha Pandey were brilliant. Alyssa Healy just took the game away from India in the final with her aggressive approach. \"The fact that India had to chase also did not work in their favour as they set totals in majority of the league games,\" said Shantha.\n\nShantha had a word of advice for the sensational Shafali.\n\n\"I hopes she takes a lesson out of Harman as far as her fitness is concerned. She needs to improve her running between wickets and fielding and that will come with better fitness.\n\n\"She is getting away right now because of her big-hitting prowess. She will be a much bigger asset with improved fitness.\" Diana reiterated the need for a mental coach with the team's performance consistently nosediving in knock-out games of ICC events.\n\n\"I want them to get over the loss quickly because they have a big World Cup coming. We need a medium pacer definitely. If Shikha breaks down, then there is no one and fielding and running between the wicket has to improve come what may.\n\n\"We also need a mental coach with the team (considering loss in knock out games),\" added Diana.\n\nMeanwhile Arothe, who was the team's coach when it lost to England in the 2017 World Cup final, said, \"You cannot send Tania Bhatia at number three as she isn't a big hitter. If you wanted to take advantage of first six overs, send a hitter.\"\n\n\"It was just one bad day. Every team had one bad in the league stage except India. Everything went against us. The body language was down in the first six-seven overs,\" added Arothe.","1047":"Shape-morphing carbon fiber composite using electrochemical actuation Edited by David A.

He never expected the Gophers to struggle shooting the ball as much as they have this season, especially in Big Ten Conference play.\n\nEntering Sunday's game at last-place Northwestern, the Gophers (12-13, 6-9) are last in the Big Ten in field goal percentage (39.4 percent) and three-point percentage (27.6) in league games.\n\nLike anyone that plays the game of basketball, you get discouraged when you're not making shots. Pitino understands that happens, but it has sunk his entire team's confidence during a recent three-game losing streak\n\n\"You want to make shots,\" Pitino said Saturday. \"They equate playing well with making shots. When you have a lot of guys shooting low percentages, especially from the three-point line they don't have a tendency of pointing fingers. It's not that type of group. They're really good kids and they want to win. But they kind of get in their own head.\"\n\nIt doesn't matter whether opponents have struggled defensively or not in the past. Pitino's team hasn't been able to get any confidence going offensively against anyone lately. Will that disturbing trend change to help snap a three-game losing streak Sunday?\n\nThe last two games were a sign of how bad offense can turn into even worse defense down the stretch. They were outscored 11-0 in a 58-51 loss against Iowa in the last 5:25. They were blanked again 8-0 in the last two-plus minutes while falling 68-56 against Indiana on Wednesday, which included shooting 26.7 percent in the second half (2-for-14 from three).\n\n\"What young players got to understand is if you get down on yourself that hurts the team,\" Pitino added. \"The team needs everybody, regardless of if you're 10-for-10 from the field or 0-for-10 from the field. The team needs you present and locked in on the next play, making the right next play. It's hard. That's hard for everybody. Because when you're struggling, you got to get over yourself and into the team. That's what we always say.\"\n\nIn the five losses in six games, the Gophers are shooting just 34.9 percent from the field (106 for 304) and 22.3 percent from three (27 for 121). It also didn't help to shoot just 16-for-31 from the free throw line in the last two losses.\n\nThe Gophers' leading scorer Daniel Oturu is averaging 19.6 points on 56.5 percent shooting this season. But he was held to 26 points combined on 11-for-28 shooting (39.3 percent) in the last two games against Iowa and Indiana. Second-leading scorer Marcus Carr is averaging 15 points, but he had just 10 points on 3-for-12 shooting vs. Iowa and 12 points on 3-for-19 shooting vs. Indiana. The Gophers are just 3-9 this season when Carr scores 12 points or fewer, but he wants to get Oturu more involved in key points in the game.\n\n\"We need to take advantage of whatever advantage he has down there,\" Carr said about Oturu. \"Trying to throw it into him and get it into the spots he likes - just let him go to work.\"\n\nPitino would also like to see Oturu and his frontcourt play better defensively. Indiana's Trayce Jackson-Davis (27 points and 16 rebounds) and Iowa's Luka Garza (24 points) carved them up recently.\n\n\"Everybody needs to be able to shut down these bigs,\" Pitino said. \"As remarkable a year offensively as Daniel's had, we've always allowed other big guys to have their way with us ... For a big guy, he plays so many minutes and he's giving us a lot. I know he wants to win, but he needs to continue to grow. Get as physical as you can.

The dominance of N-helix binding sites in the earliest enzymes reflects the ability of the \u03b1-helix to realize binding via short and simple sequences, including serines and threonines that interact via both the backbone and side chain.","1055":"Should I turn off the circuit breaker to my AC for the winter? Shortly after posting our fall maintenance checklist this year, I had a reader contact me to let me know that I may have missed an important fall maintenance item. His suggestion was to turn off the circuit breaker for your air conditioner during the winter months to help save electricity. If your air conditioner has a crankcase heater, that thing will run all winter long, and you'll be paying for all of that electricity.\n\nSo what's a crankcase heater? It's a small resistance heater that helps to prevent damage to your air conditioner by keeping the compressor warm. More on that topic here: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Crankcase_heater\n\nFrom a home inspection standpoint, I don't look for crankcase heaters and I don't inspect them. Most air conditioners don't have them, and if a unit does have one, I don't trust that it's working. When an air conditioner is operated in cold weather, generally below 60\u00b0 - 65\u00b0 F, there's a potential to cause permanent damage to the unit. See https:\/\/www.webhvac.com\/2012\/01\/will-running-an-air-conditioner-in-cold-weather-damage-it\/ for more information on that topic.\n\nHere at Structure Tech, we don't operate units when the outdoor temperature is below 60 degrees, or when the unit is turned off at the circuit breaker.\n\nIf your air conditioner has a crankcase heater that runs constantly, whether the air conditioner is on or not, that will really run up your electricity bill, right?\n\nI'd say it's all about perspective. Assuming you have a 70-watt heater and you pay $0.11\/KwH, you'll end up paying .07 KW x $0.11\/KWH, or about $0.0077 an hour. Less than a penny an hour, or about 18\u00a2 per day. It's not much, but it can get into the double-digits over the course of a Minnesota winter. Not enough to the point where you'd see any noticeable difference in your electricity bill on a monthly basis, however.\n\nI don't know of any simple way to figure this out for sure. One way would be to take a look inside of your air conditioner. You can usually peek through the top grill into the outdoor unit to get a look at the compressor. If there's an exterior crankcase heater, you'll see it wrapped around the compressor. The video clip below shows a compressor without a crankcase heater.\n\nThe picture below shows a peek inside of a unit that has an external crankcase heater.\n\nIf you have an internal crankcase heater, there won't be any evidence, other than a pair of wires entering the unit, which you might not be able to see.\n\nTo know if this heater is actually sucking electricity, you could take a clamp-on electric meter to your air conditioner circuit to see if there is a load being drawn, but that goes well beyond traditional homeowner DIY maintenance.\n\nIf you have a Sense energy monitor installed at your electric panel, all you'd have to do is turn off the power to your air conditioner to see if your power usage changes.\n\nThere are pros and cons to turning off the power to your air conditioner for the winter. I've had HVAC technicians tell me about air conditioners that have been destroyed from running in freezing temperatures. Either someone in the family accidentally switched the thermostat to cool, or the thermostat simply malfunctioned and the unit kicked on. Turning off your circuit breaker would certainly help to prevent something like that from happening.\n\nIf you have a crankcase heater, turning off the circuit will also save on electricity usage throughout the winter.\n\nOn the other hand, I've spoken with several HVAC contractors who said they've had countless service calls to fix broken air conditioners, only to find a circuit breaker that was turned off. If you read this blog, you're surely a diligent enough homeowner who wouldn't make that mistake. But still. Plenty of people aren't, so be careful advising people to turn off the power to their air conditioner. Also, if you're relying on a crankcase heater to warm up the unit enough to not cause damage when it's cool outside, the power should be restored to the air conditioner 72 hours before running it.\n\nIn short, I don't feel strongly one way or the other about turning off power to the air conditioner, but it's something to consider.","1056":"Should you install heat cables to prevent ice dams? This is a guest blog post by Steve Kuhl of Radiant Solutions Company.\n\nHeat cable has a dubious reputation in the ice dam prevention world. It's a topic few understand in-depth, both in terms of what it is and how to install it properly. In this three-part series, I will go deep into heat cable to provide clarity on what it is, where it works and doesn't work, what to buy, what to avoid, and finally some tips on designing and installing your own heat cable system.\n\nThe snowflakes in early October brought back bad memories of early 2019 for many Minnesotans. Impassable streets, flooded basements and of course, visions of nasty ice dams adorning homes both large and small. For those who are new to the area, an ice dam is a ridge of ice that accumulates on roofs, usually at the eave, that forces meltwater through the roof system and into your home. Think of them as mini glaciers that will ruin your house if you ignore them. Welcome to Minnesota!\n\nWhile most insurance companies will pay to repair the damage left behind by ice dams they will NOT help pay for preventing them in the future, leaving many homeowners wondering how to avoid this troublesome and expensive problem. Making matters worse, some insurance companies are responding to ice dam claims by requiring homeowners to pay for expensive improvements aimed at preventing future ice dams. Without these improvements, future ice dam related claims may be denied.\n\nIndustry pros recognize that the best solutions to ice dams involve making architectural enhancements to your home including insulation, ventilation and perhaps most important, sealing all of the air leaks that allow heat to go where it shouldn't go and melt snow it shouldn't melt. Remember, the resulting meltwater is what fuels the ice dam cycle as it refreezes along the eaves. Over the past quarter-century, we have engaged in hundreds of such home performance projects, with the average cost ranging between $10,000 and $30,000. The video clip below shows an example of the scope of this project.\n\nThese aren't simple insulation and air-sealing jobs. This is hard, messy work that usually involves demolition and reconstruction of either the interior or exterior of the home or sometimes both. When it's done well it can be called a valuable home improvement that will reduce the likelihood of ice dams while increasing energy efficiency. When it's not done well it can be a waste of money that may even make ice dam problems worse. Bummer.\n\nWe all agree that architectural ice dam prevention methods are wonderful. In reality, however, many homeowners simply don't have that sort of money in the budget. What's more, I've seen dozens of ice dam cases where good intentions and ample budgets resulted in no meaningful improvement. This is why no roofing, remodeling or insulation company will ever guarantee in writing that their work will completely eliminate ice dams. It's not realistic. For example, due to their design, it is almost impossible to insulate, ventilate and air-seal your way around ice dams if you live in a story-and-a-half home. Sorry, Saint Louis Park. Homes with a complex series of intersecting roof planes or vaulted ceilings with little-to-no room for insulation can make architectural solutions impractical if not impossible.\n\nRoof shoveling can be an effective approach to ice dam prevention, assuming a few very important rules are followed. First, all of the snow must be removed from the entire roof plane affected by ice dams. Contrary to popular belief, removing the snow from the lower few feet of your roof can create a much worse situation known as a double-dam, which is the formation of a secondary ice dam higher on the roof.\n\nDouble dams are very expensive to remove and can cause tremendous damage if left unmitigated. On many homes, it's not realistic to remove all of the snow up to the peak by roof raking from the ground or the top of a ladder because the affected roof planes may be two or three stories high or otherwise inaccessible.\n\nThis means someone has to climb up there, which is generally not a good idea for the novice to attempt. For many homes, the only option is to call in the pros, which is admittedly expensive. The video clip below shows some examples of professional snow removal.\n\nThe Ice Dam Company does a ton of snow removal here in Minnesota. Some clients choose annual contracts while others call after each significant snowfall. Our average roof shoveling job is $400 per visit, making professional roof shoveling an expensive approach to ice dam prevention, especially when we make multiple visits throughout the winter. Most people would get more satisfaction out of burning a pile of cash in their driveway than hiring us to shovel their roof all winter. I can't blame them.\n\nThe other essential roof shoveling rule to follow is that all snow accumulations above 2\" should be removed from the roof within 24 hours. Allowing snow to reside on a roof prone to ice dams has obvious consequences so you need to be vigilant with your roof rake. Under the right conditions, we see the process of ice dam formation start within one day of a fresh snowfall. The combination of all these factors means that many people get ice dams despite their good intentions to prevent them by roof raking. People get busy. People forget. Ice dams happen. Enter the humble heat cable.\n\nIt goes by many names, including heat cable, heat coil, and roof deicing cable, but the underlying principle of all ice dam prevention heat tape is the same. These cables use electrical resistance to generate warmth, creating melted pathways through the snow and ice on the roof. Those pathways allow water to escape from the roof instead of backing up into the home. The purpose of heat cable is ONLY to create relief channels through snow and ice, not to keep the eaves completely free of snow.\n\nWhen a high-quality cable is used and it's installed by someone who knows what they're doing, heat cables can provide a decade of reliable ice dam prevention. In fact, there are circumstances when heat cables are the only realistic option for ice dam prevention. We run into these homes frequently in our inspections. Even still, there are industry holdouts who proclaim heat cables are ineffective. I think this owes to a lack of basic knowledge of the types of cables and the pros and cons each has to offer. Contributing to that ignorance is the fact that heat cables often fail, leaving behind water-damaged ceilings and disillusioned homeowners.\n\nI've discussed the common approaches to ice dam prevention including architectural solutions, roof raking, and heat cable. Next week, in Part Two, I will explore heat cables in much greater depth, including their construction and use.","1057":"Should you remove your loved one from long-term care? It's a 'very complex question,' Toronto's top doctor says Toronto's top doctor says there is \"no easy answer\" for people wondering if they should remove their loved ones from long-term care homes in the wake of COVID-19.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference at city hall on Monday afternoon, Dr. Eileen de Villa said the answer to this \"very complex question\" will depend on a number of factors.\n\n\"Ultimately the decision to remove your loved one from a long-term care home or a retirement home is a personal decision,\" she said.\n\nAccording to the city's latest data, there have been 135 cases of COVID-19 in Toronto's long-term care homes and 15 reported deaths.\n\nThe provincial government confirmed Monday that there are currently 46 outbreaks at long-term care facilities across the province.\n\nAt a long-term care home in Bobcaygeon, Ont., 26 patients have died following an outbreak of the virus.\n\nDe Villa said while it is understandable people have questions about whether their loved one should stay in these facilities in the wake of the pandemic, anyone considering this option should make sure they understand the specific daily care needs of their family member before making a decision.\n\n\"Typically, people in long-term care homes are receiving specialized care that is not possible, or at best, challenging to provide within a home setting. Residents of long-term care homes are often frail with many complex underlying health issues and equally complex health care needs,\" she said.\n\n\"I would advise anyone considering this step to speak with the long-term care director at the home to inform your decision and to understand the specific daily care needs of your loved one.\"\n\nDr. Asenath Steiman, a geriatrician at University Health Network and Sinai Health System and the clinical lead of the independence at home community outreach team, said for some who are not currently working, they may be in a better position to provide personal care to their loved ones.\n\n\"I think it is going to be very individualized,\" she told CP24.com. \"Really the main issue is going to be could the care needs of that patient be met out of long-term care.\"\n\nShe said people need to have up-to-date information about their family member's care needs, as those routines and needs may have changed since they were first admitted to the home.\n\nAnother issue is that the community resources that are typically available to those who need home care, such as assistance from personal support workers, may not be readily available in the current climate, Steiman said.\n\n\"The services are still happening but... it might be a little different,\" she said. \"The resources that are usually there might be strained.\"\n\nSteiman said people also need to consider what type of impact the move will have on their loved one, adding that patients with dementia often struggle in new environments.\n\n\"It could make things worse temporarily in that new environment,\" she said. \"They (caregivers) should be prepared for that.\"\n\nAnother major issue, Steiman noted, is whether the bed will be held for the patient when the pandemic is over.\n\n\"The fact that they are going to be leaving long-term care, are they going to be losing their bed now,\" she asked. \"Will they have somewhere to go back to?\"\n\nShe said while many facilities will hold beds for patients who require hospitalization, it is not clear how many long-term care homes will opt to hold beds for those who elect to leave.\n\nSteiman said people should get a clear answer to the question before making the decision to remove their loved one from long-term care.\n\nFor those who choose to keep their loved ones in long-term care, de Villa said strict protocols are in place to ensure that residents are protected during the pandemic.\n\nShe said staff members are directed to work in only one long-term care setting to prevent further spread and staff members are screened for symptoms of illness when they enter the building and when they finish their shift.\n\nShe said residents are given twice daily checks for any new onset of symptoms and any resident who displays symptoms are isolated immediately.\n\nNon-essential visitors have also been barred from entering the buildings.\n\n\"I understand that it is difficult and worrisome to not be able to visit our loved ones at this time,\" de Villa said.\n\n\"I can tell you this; staff at long-term care and retirement residences are, in my experience, deeply, deeply committed tothe wellbeing of their residents. I know they will do whatever they can to help you stay connected.\"\n\nDe Villa urged members of the public to continue social distancing to keep essential workers, including long-term care staff, healthy.\n\n\"I would like to take this opportunity to thank each and every person working in a long-term care homeor a retirement home caring for our loved ones,\" she said.","1058":"Shrek, Kung Fu Panda among DreamWorks movies just added to Netflix in NZ | Newshub Kiwi families enduring the COVID-19 alert level 4 lockdown have just been offered a bunch of new kids' movies to choose from with their streaming options.\n\nNetflix has added 17 DreamWorks Animation films for its New Zealand customers, including much-loved modern classics like Shrek, Kung Fu Panda and How to Train Your Dragon.\n\nDreamWorks Animation is somewhat of a rival to Disney\/Pixar, which is also adding a bunch of family films to its streaming service this month.\n\nApril is 'Earth Month' on Disney Plus, with a raft of Disneynature and National Geographic documentaries being added, including Dolphin Reef narrated by Natalie Portman and Elephant narrated by Meghan Markle.\n\nBoth Netflix and Disney Plus offer free trials to people who haven't used the services before.\n\nThe DreamWorks just films added to Netflix Australia and New Zealand are the following:\n\nBee Movie (2006) Flushed Away (2007) How to Train Your Dragon (2010) Kung Fu Panda (2008) Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011) Madagascar (2005) Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa (2008) Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted (2012) Megamind (2010) Over the Hedge (2006) Puss in Boots (2011) Rise of the Guardians (2012) Shark Tale (2004) Shrek 2 (2004) Shrek the Third (2007) Shrek Forever After (2010) Wallace & Grommit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit (2005)","1059":"Sid Hartman is the World's Longest-Serving Newspaper Columnist  --  officially!

This study elucidates the molecular mechanism of inflammatory processes in acute ocular inflammation mediated by GHRH-R. In human ciliary epithelial cells, the expression of the GHRH-R gene is elevated after lipopolysaccharide insult through the phosphorylation of NF-\u03baB. The activation of GHRH-R stimulates activity of the JAK2\/STAT3 pathway, leading to cytokine and chemokine production. In a rat model of endotoxin-induced uveitis, and in human ciliary epithelial cells, antagonists targeting the GHRH-R\/JAK2\/STAT3-signaling axis alleviate partially the inflammatory responses, supporting a potential therapeutic approach to acute ocular inflammation.\n\nOcular inflammation is a major cause of visual impairment attributed to dysregulation of the immune system. Previously, we have shown that the receptor for growth-hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH-R) affects multiple inflammatory processes. To clarify the pathological roles of GHRH-R in acute ocular inflammation, we investigated the inflammatory cascades mediated by this receptor. In human ciliary epithelial cells, the NF-\u03baB subunit p65 was phosphorylated in response to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), resulting in transcriptional up-regulation of GHRH-R. Bioinformatics analysis and coimmunoprecipitation showed that GHRH-R had a direct interaction with JAK2. JAK2, but not JAK1, JAK3, and TYK2, was elevated in ciliary body and iris after treatment with LPS in a rat model of endotoxin-induced uveitis. This elevation augmented the phosphorylation of STAT3 and production of proinflammatory factors, including IL-6, IL-17A, COX2, and iNOS. In explants of iris and ciliary body, the GHRH-R antagonist, MIA-602, suppressed phosphorylation of STAT3 and attenuated expression of downstream proinflammatory factors after LPS treatment. A similar suppression of STAT3 phosphorylation was observed in human ciliary epithelial cells. In vivo studies showed that blocking of the GHRH-R\/JAK2\/STAT3 axis with the JAK inhibitor Ruxolitinib alleviated partially the LPS-induced acute ocular inflammation by reducing inflammatory cells and protein leakage in the aqueous humor and by repressing expression of STAT3 target genes in rat ciliary body and iris and in human ciliary epithelial cells. Our findings indicate a functional role of the GHRH-R\/JAK2\/STAT3-signaling axis in acute anterior uveitis and suggest a therapeutic strategy based on treatment with antagonists targeting this signaling pathway.","1064":"Signing at the beginning versus at the end does not decrease dishonesty Edited by Lee D. Ross, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, and approved February 7, 2020 (received for review July 15, 2019)\n\nIn 2012, five of the current authors published a paper in PNAS showing that people are more honest when they are asked to sign a veracity statement at the beginning instead of at the end of a tax or insurance audit form. In a recent investigation, across five related experiments we failed to find an effect of signing at the beginning on dishonesty. Following up on these studies, we conducted one preregistered, high-powered direct replication of experiment 1 of the PNAS paper, in which we failed to replicate the original result. The current paper updates the scientific record by showing that signing at the beginning is unlikely to be a simple solution for increasing honest reporting.","1065":"Simon & Jan und Vielharmonie: Halleluja - Teil 1 von 2 Die beiden Mittdrei\u00dfiger haben die deutsche Liedermacherszene von ganz unten aufgerollt, viele kleine Konzerte gespielt, aber auch die B\u00fchne mit Gr\u00f6\u00dfen wie Konstantin Wecker, G\u00f6tz Widmann oder Stefan Stoppok geteilt.

Here, we show that, in a group of hunter-gatherers, time spent sedentary is similar to that found in industrialized populations. However, sedentary time in hunter-gatherers is often spent in postures like squatting that lead to higher levels of muscle activity than chair sitting. Thus, we suggest human physiology likely evolved in a context that included substantial inactivity, but increased muscle activity during sedentary time, suggesting an inactivity mismatch with the more common chair-sitting postures found in contemporary urban populations.\n\nRecent work suggests human physiology is not well adapted to prolonged periods of inactivity, with time spent sitting increasing cardiovascular disease and mortality risk. Health risks from sitting are generally linked with reduced levels of muscle contractions in chair-sitting postures and associated reductions in muscle metabolism. These inactivity-associated health risks are somewhat paradoxical, since evolutionary pressures tend to favor energy-minimizing strategies, including rest. Here, we examined inactivity in a hunter-gatherer population (the Hadza of Tanzania) to understand how sedentary behaviors occur in a nonindustrial economic context more typical of humans' evolutionary history. We tested the hypothesis that nonambulatory rest in hunter-gatherers involves increased muscle activity that is different from chair-sitting sedentary postures used in industrialized populations. Using a combination of objectively measured inactivity from thigh-worn accelerometers, observational data, and electromygraphic data, we show that hunter-gatherers have high levels of total nonambulatory time (mean \u00b1 SD = 9.90 \u00b1 2.36 h\/d), similar to those found in industrialized populations. However, nonambulatory time in Hadza adults often occurs in postures like squatting, and we show that these \"active rest\" postures require higher levels of lower limb muscle activity than chair sitting. Based on our results, we introduce the Inactivity Mismatch Hypothesis and propose that human physiology is likely adapted to more consistently active muscles derived from both physical activity and from nonambulatory postures with higher levels of muscle contraction. Interventions built on this model may help reduce the negative health impacts of inactivity in industrialized populations.","1067":"Six things you need to know about your HomeSmart, Service Plus appliance contract Many HomeSmart and Home Service Plus appliance repair plan customers like the peace of mind that the plans offered through Xcel Energy or CenterPoint Energy can provide. But a pattern of complaints on Google and Yelp show wait times of five to 20 days for some customers when a furnace or air conditioner goes on the fritz. Other consumers complained about difficulties canceling HomeSmart and Service Plus plans even after a move and technicians who never show up after the customer takes a day off work.\n\nSimilar to an extended warranty, appliance repair plans charge about $20 a month to cover four large appliances such as a furnace, central air conditioner, washer, hot water heater, dryer, refrigerator, dishwasher and range.\n\nThe Better Business Bureau of Minnesota and North Dakota lists a number of complaints, but consumers considering a service plan may want to check the hundreds of online reviews before committing. The two companies are rated between two and four stars on Yelp and Google.\n\nTwin Cities Consumers' Checkbook editor Kevin Brasler recommends skipping the service plans and socking away the $250 or more annual payments in a savings account for repairs. For a free look at recommended repair shops in the Twin Cities for furnaces and central air, go to www.checkbook.org\/startribune\/HVAC. For appliances, go to www.checkbook.org\/startribune\/ApplianceRepair. Companies are rated on quality of service and fair pricing.\n\nXcel's HomeSmart basic program charges $2 less per month than CenterPoint's Service Plus. The major difference is that CenterPoint offers immediate coverage at sign-up. Xcel customers are covered after 30 days. Xcel customers who initiate a service call before 30 days can still request a technician but are charged regular rates for the trip.\n\nConsumers frustrated with the contract may get better results posting a complaint online than asking to speak to a supervisor. HomeSmart and Service Plus supervisors monitor the Yelp and Google comments and sometimes post a phone number to call them directly. Many people commenting mention wait times of 20 minutes or longer to speak to a representative.\n\n1. You may still be charged after you move or want to cancel.\n\nFew customers probably realize their service plan is a 12-month contract that cannot be canceled on a whim. Even customers who have moved to a rented apartment or to a different state have found themselves still paying for service on appliances they no longer own. Canceling the utility service when moving does not automatically stop the service plan because HomeSmart and Service Plus are separate companies from the utilities and are not publicly regulated.\n\nEven a phone call may not be enough to cancel the service. Xcel requires the cancellation be done in writing. \"I tried to cancel my service in November and was told I could not cancel until May,\" wrote one person who commented about HomeSmart on Google. \" I was then told I would have to cancel in writing.\" CenterPoint Service Plus members can call 1-877-477-1664 to cancel, according to CenterPoint spokeswoman Alyssia Oshodi.\n\nCustomers who want to cancel HomeSmart or Service Plus need to contact them directly not Xcel or CenterPoint. Customers are notified once a year of a contract, but the wording in the notice only hints at it. \"Your coverage automatically renews on (date)\" and \"We look forward to providing you with another year of excellent service,\" the Xcel HomeSmart notice said.\n\nIt is possible for customers to cancel their service due to a move if there has not been a claim in the past 12 months, but the customer may need to speak to a supervisor. \"While the terms of service note that customers must pay for the remaining months of an annual agreement, we can generally work with customers to waive that amount if they haven't had a service call in the last 12 months,\" said Xcel Energy spokesman Randy Fordice.\n\nWorkaround: Ask when your plan renews, especially if you're considering canceling or moving.\n\n2. Waits of five days to two weeks for service are not uncommon if your furnace or air conditioning goes out during peak times. During the first heat wave or cold spell, many appliances don't function properly and the supply of service technicians can't keep up. That could mean more than a week without heat or cooling. Catherine Yang of Minneapolis was told it would be 10 days before a technician could make it to her house in July during a stretch of 90 degree days. She called an independent technician instead who offered same day service at a reasonable price.\n\nWorkaround: Call the company that sold or installed the appliance if it's fairly new, or get a reputable independent repair place from friends or Checkbook.\n\n3. Technician no-shows are a common complaint. Consumers commenting on Google and Yelp say they take a day off work to meet a technician to arrive between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. but no one never calls or shows. Colleen Norenberg of Brooklyn Center reported having to wait another 10 days for a technician after the first one from Service Plus never showed.\n\nWorkaround: Ask for an ETA if available on the day of service or schedule an independent backup for a later day.\n\n4. Pay attention to the list of what's not covered by the contract as well as what is covered. Furnace heat exchangers, air conditioning compressors, refrigerators in garages, water\/ice dispensers on refrigerators and ceramic or glass cooktops are rarely covered.\n\n5. Got an older appliance? Service plans won't repair it if parts aren't available.

It has also ordered abortion clinics, alongside other medical offices, to comply with this. A District Court issued a TRO limiting the application of this to abortion clinics, and today the Sixth Circuit (in Pre-Term Cleveland v. Attorney General) decline to reverse the TRO, on the grounds that appellate courts generally lack jurisdiction to hear appeals from such temporary orders. But in the process, a concurring and dissenting opinion revealed something that wasn't clear when the case was first filed (emphasis added):\n\nUnder the State's interpretation [of the ban], doctors are free to prescribe drugs to induce an abortion in accordance with state law. Further, doctors may still perform surgical abortions if the doctor determines that the abortion is necessary to protect the mother's life or health, or if the doctor determines that any delay will jeopardize the woman's right to obtain an abortion. The Attorney General has specifically noted that the Director's Order will be enforced so as to comply with the strictures of Supreme Court precedent. While the Director's Order may, in some cases, cause a delay in a woman's ability to obtain an abortion, the State may be able to establish that it has left open sufficient channels such that the Order does not impose an undue burden on a woman's right to obtain an abortion.\n\nHowever, the State did not advance its interpretation of the Director's Order before the district court, despite apparently being given the opportunity in two telephonic conferences to do so. Given these circumstances, and in light of the district court's clarification of the TRO through its order denying the motion for a stay, I do not believe that the district court abused its discretion in maintaining the status quo to the best extent it could until the preliminary injunction could be decided.\n\nHere is the heart of the panel majority opinion, signed by Chief Judge Cole and Judge Guy:\n\nOn March 17, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Director of the Ohio Department of Health issued an order titled \"RE: Director's Order for the Management of Non- essential Surgeries and Procedures throughout Ohio.\" (\"Director's Order\"). It directs that all non- essential or elective surgeries and procedures that utilize personal protective equipment (\"PPE\") should not be conducted. A violation of the order is a second-degree misdemeanor.\n\nOn March 20, 2020, and March 21, 2020, the Providers received letters from the State warning them that if they did not immediately stop performing non-essential or elective surgical abortions in compliance with the Director's Order, the Department of Health would take appropriate measures. The Providers sought a TRO, which the district court granted, in part, on March 30, 2020.\n\nAs both parties acknowledge, we must first determine whether we have jurisdiction in this matter. We have jurisdiction of appeals from \"[i]nterlocutory orders of the district courts of the United States ... granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions.\" 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). We generally lack jurisdiction to hear an appeal of a district court's decision to grant or deny a TRO. \"The rationale for this rule is that TROs are of short duration and usually terminate with a prompt ruling on a preliminary injunction, from which the losing party has an immediate right of appeal.\" However, the label the district court attaches to its order is not controlling, and we will \"look[] to the nature of the order and the substance of the proceeding below to determine whether the rationale for denying appeal applies.\" Accordingly, courts have allowed interlocutory appeals of TROs that threaten to inflict irretrievable harms or consequences before the TRO expires or, rather than preserving the status quo, act as a mandatory injunction requiring affirmative action....\n\nThe State argues that, at a minimum, the TRO threatens to inflict irretrievable harm because the Director's Order is designed to preserve PPEs for those responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the State, every piece of PPE that the Providers expend on surgical abortions is one that those most in need of such equipment cannot use to protect themselves and may ultimately cause people to die. It suggests that the TRO allows Providers to \"risk the public health in order to provide a surgical abortion to anyone who wants one whenever they want it.\"\n\nTo the contrary, the TRO is narrowly tailored. The district court held\n\n\"that Plaintiff healthcare providers are to determine if a surgical abortion procedure can be safely postponed during the pre-viability stage to maximize healthcare resources to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. If a healthcare provider determines, on a case-by-case basis, that the surgical procedure is medically indicated and cannot be delayed, based on the timing of pre-viability or other medical conditions, said procedure is deemed legally essential to preserve a woman's right to constitutionally protected access to abortions.\"\n\nThe district court has clarified in denying a stay of the TRO that the \"case-by-case basis\" determination does not permit \"blanket 'on-demand provision of elective abortions,'\" and that \"Plaintiffs may not perform surgical abortions if they can induce the same abortion medicinally or perform abortions that can be delayed without jeopardizing the mother's health, life, or ability to exercise her Fourteenth Amendment right to a pre-viability abortion.\" With that clarification, we are not persuaded that the TRO threatens to inflict irretrievable harms or consequences before it expires, and it requires no affirmative action by the State. Thus, we lack jurisdiction over this appeal.\n\nOne final point bears mentioning. There are multiple forms of surgical abortion, all of which are typically provided in a clinical setting rather than a hospital. The first uses the aspiration method, which can be performed up to approximately 15 weeks measured from the first day of the pregnant woman's last menstrual cycle. It requires no incision, general anesthesia, or sterile field.\n\nAfter 15 weeks, a second method, called the dilation and evacuation technique, is used and, depending on how far into the pregnancy it is performed, requires more time in the clinic and uses more PPE. The State argues that the intent of the Director's Order is to preserve PPEs in the immediate near-term, \"[s]o the fact that the order might require (some) abortionists to use more PPEs weeks or months from now (in some cases) is really beside the point.\" But it is not beside the point to question whether the Director's Order deprives a woman of her right to an abortion during the optimal 15-week period during which the aspiration method can be performed. A prompt ruling by the district court on the Providers' motion for a preliminary injunction may shed further light on this issue.\n\nJudge Bush concurred as to denying the motion for a stay of the TRO, but dissented as to whether the court had jurisdiction to consider the appeal:","1069":"Skeletal stochastic differential equations for continuous-state branching processes | Journal of Applied Probability | Cambridge Core It is well understood that a supercritical continuous-state branching process (CSBP) is equal in law to a discrete continuous-time Galton-Watson process (the skeleton of prolific individuals) whose edges are dressed in a Poissonian way with immigration which initiates subcritical CSBPs (non-prolific mass). Equally well understood in the setting of CSBPs and superprocesses is the notion of a spine or immortal particle dressed in a Poissonian way with immigration which initiates copies of the original CSBP, which emerges when conditioning the process to survive eternally. In this article we revisit these notions for CSBPs and put them in a common framework using the well-established language of (coupled) stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In this way we are able to deal simultaneously with all types of CSBPs (supercritical, critical, and subcritical) as well as understanding how the skeletal representation becomes, in the sense of weak convergence, a spinal decomposition when conditioning on survival. We have two principal motivations. The first is to prepare the way to expand the SDE approach to the spatial setting of superprocesses, where recent results have increasingly sought the use of skeletal decompositions to transfer results from the branching particle setting to the setting of measure valued processes. The second is to provide a pathwise decomposition of CSBPs in the spirit of genealogical coding of CSBPs via L\u00e9vy excursions, albeit precisely where the aforesaid coding fails to work because the underlying CSBP is supercritical.","1070":"Skydiving From the Edge of Space How Alan Eustace, a Google engineer on the edge of retirement, broke the world record for high-altitude jumping\n\nLink Copied\n\nOn May 8, 2013, Alan Eustace, then the 56-year-old senior vice president of knowledge at Google, jumped from an airplane18,000 feet above the desert in Coolidge, Arizona. Anyone watching would have witnessed an odd sight: Eustace was wearing a bulky white space suit -- the kind nasa astronauts wear. He looked like a free-falling Michelin Man.\n\nListen to the audio version of this article:Feature stories, read aloud: download the Audm app for your iPhone.\n\nThrough his giant space helmet and oxygen mask, Eustace could see the ground stretched out for miles. But the view wasn't his main concern. He hadn't quite worked out how to control the space suit, which, unlike a typical skydiving suit, weighed about 265 pounds and was pumped full of pressurized air. Eustace, an experienced skydiver, knew how to shift his body to change direction or to stop himself from spinning -- a problem that, if uncorrected, can lead to blackout, then death. But when he started to rotate -- slowly at first, then faster and faster -- his attempts to steady himself just made things worse. He felt like he was bouncing around inside a concrete box.\n\nAt 10,000 feet, Eustace pulled a cord to open his parachute. Nothing happened. Then he tried a backup cord. That one didn't work either. Eustace knew better than to panic: Three safety divers had jumped with him to monitor his fall. Within seconds, one of the divers reached across Eustace and yanked open the main chute.\n\nAll Eustace had to do now was depressurize his suit, which would deflate it and allow him to steer himself toward the landing area. He reached for a dial on the side of the suit and turned it. Nothing happened. With the suit still pressurized, Eustace couldn't extend his arms overhead to grab the handles that controlled the chute. He began slowly drifting off course. Soon he lost sight of the safety divers. He tried to radio for help, but got no response. He now had a more pressing problem: As he approached the ground, he saw that he was headed straight for a giant saguaro cactus. Unable to maneuver his chute, he leaned as far to the right as he could and just managed to avoid the cactus, instead landing headfirst in the sand.\n\nHe craned his neck to look around. The suit was still pressurized, which meant that he didn't have enough flexibility to take his helmet off to breathe. He tried his radio again. Still dead. He knew the safety divers would have alerted rescuers that he'd gone off course. He just didn't know how far off course he'd gone. He calculated that he had two hours of oxygen left in his tank. If he sat still and didn't panic, he should have enough to survive until the rescue team found him. His other option was to try depressurizing the suit again. But if that didn't work, he'd have wasted a significant amount of oxygen in the effort. He decided to wait until he had just 15 minutes of oxygen left. By that point, he would be desperate enough to try anything.\n\nThe sun beat down as Eustace lay by the cactus, watching the meter on his oxygen tank.\n\nTwelve minutes and what felt like an eternity later, he heard the sound of an approaching helicopter. Oh good, he thought, relaxing. I'm nowhere near dead.\n\nWhich was fortunate, because this was only a practice round. What Eustace was gearing up for was something much more dangerous: a jump from seven and a half times the altitude, the highest ever attempted. A skydive from the edge of space.\n\nThe whole thing began innocently enough. Eustace was sitting in his office at Google's headquarters in Mountain View, California, one day in late 2008 when his boss Sergey Brin dropped by. Brin knew Eustace had skydived recreationally in the past, and wanted to know whether he thought it would be possible for someone to jump out of a Gulfstream, a large, expensive private jet that Brin sometimes used.\n\nBrin had already asked around, but almost everyone he'd consulted -- Gulfstream pilots, military skydivers, even the company that makes the jet -- had advised against it. Gulfstreams fly at much higher speeds than typical jump planes, so fast that experts worried anyone exiting midair would risk getting sucked into the engine, or hitting the tail of the plane, or getting burned to death by the exhaust.\n\nEustace wasn't a jet pilot, or a professional daredevil. He was an engineer from Florida who had designed computer-processing units for 15 years in Palo Alto before Larry Page persuaded him to join his growing company over breakfast one morning in 2002. Eustace hadn't been skydiving in 26 years, but the idea intrigued him: He wasn't convinced that the skeptics were right. As an engineer, he preferred to approach a problem from first principles. If it was impossible, why? What was the trajectory of the exhaust? Would the FAA grant approval to open the door mid-flight, which would require circumventing the user manual?\n\nEustace spent the next few months trying to answer these questions, in between projects that demanded his more immediate attention. He eventually lined up a skydiver to try a jump out of a Cessna Caravan, another high-speed aircraft. Luckily, the skydiver landed without incident. What's more, he filmed himself. When Eustace brought Brin the footage, Brin seemed surprised that he had followed up. But by this point, Eustace was hooked -- and he was starting to consider trying the jump himself. All he'd have to do was get reacquainted with the equipment and do a couple of test jumps.\n\nIn August 2010, Eustace took a few days off and went down to the suburbs of Los Angeles, where he did six practice jumps with an instructor, a professional stunt skydiver named Luigi Cani. The two hit it off -- Cani was warm and friendly, and seemed up for anything. He loved the Gulfstream idea.\n\nA few months later, Eustace was back home in Mountain View when his phone rang. It was Cani. He wanted to know whether Eustace had heard about a guy named Felix Baumgartner, who was after an even bigger challenge: He was trying to beat the high-altitude-skydiving record with a jump from the upper reaches of the stratosphere, more than 100,000 feet in the air. Cani had found a sponsor to launch a competing effort, and wondered whether Eustace could advise him on the type of equipment he'd need.\n\nEustace was delighted. He was sure Baumgartner was way ahead -- he had backing from the energy-drink company Red Bull, which had hired more than three dozen team members with backgrounds in nasa, the Air Force, and the aerospace industry -- but he liked Cani, and wanted to see him create some healthy competition. He agreed to help in any way he could. But before Cani's effort could kick off, his funding fell through.\n\nEustace considered this news. He led a quiet, comfortable life. He wasn't after publicity or adrenaline. But this was the engineering challenge of a lifetime. Forget the Gulfstream. He could attempt the stratosphere jump himself, and fund it with his own savings. He thought for a few months and called Cani to ask for his blessing. Cani laughed, amused. Go for it, he said.\n\nThe atmosphere is divided into five layers. The higher you go, the thinner the air, until eventually you hit outer space. The layer closest to Earth, the troposphere, is where weather occurs. The next layer, between 33,000 and 160,000 feet above sea level, is the stratosphere. It marks the beginning of what's known as \"near space\" -- the threshold between the planet we experience on the ground and the mysteries of the universe beyond.\n\nPrior to the onset of the space race in the late 1950s, much of the scientific study into high altitudes was focused on the stratosphere. Starting in the 1930s, scientists used high-altitude balloons to gather meteorological data and document various changes in the upper atmosphere. Then, in 1960, a United States Air Force captain named Joseph Kittinger rose 102,800 feet in a gondola suspended from a helium balloon -- and jumped. Kittinger was part of Project Excelsior, a pre-space-age military operation designed to study the effects of high-altitude bailouts. An earlier attempt, from 76,400 feet, had almost killed him: His equipment had malfunctioned and he'd lost consciousness; he was saved only by his automatic emergency parachute. His next jump, from 74,700 feet, had gone better. This one -- his third -- set a high-altitude-skydiving record that would remain in place for more than 50 years.\n\nnasa would soon send a man into orbit, and ambitions would turn to the moon. The expansion of the space program coincided with a series of catastrophic balloon accidents, and exploration into the stratosphere was largely abandoned.\n\nThat is, until 2010, when Baumgartner announced that he was going after Kittinger's record, with the backing of none other than Kittinger himself -- plus a hefty sponsorship from Red Bull. Plenty of people had contacted Kittinger over the years, wanting him to help them break the record, but Baumgartner was the first to come with a sound scientific support system, courtesy of Red Bull's team of professionals. The effort, amplified by Baumgartner's high-octane personal life, attracted a lot of press.\n\nEustace was an unlikely competitor. The son of an aerospace engineer for Martin Marietta (a forerunner of Lockheed Martin), Eustace had grown up loving planes, but his first time jumping out of one -- 18 years old, dragged along by his best friend -- he felt less exhilaration than ambivalence. The equipment was primitive -- coveralls, thick boots, military-grade parachutes -- and Eustace landed hard. The experience was a blur. He didn't know whether he'd done it right, and he certainly didn't plan to do it again.\n\nThen the instructor handed him his evaluation. His friend's jump was terrible, but the instructor had deemed Eustace's \"perfect.\" So when his friend wanted to go back a week later, Eustace went along. He enjoyed it much more the second time: He was less nervous, and could actually remember what he had done. He went again, and again, and after his 10th jump, he invested in a higher-performance parachute. Then he mastered a stand-up landing, instead of a drop-and-roll. He learned to dive, swoop, somersault, slow down, and speed up, until skydiving became less like falling than like flying.\n\nEustace began skydiving as often as he could manage between classes at the University of Central Florida, where he majored in computer science and went on to get his doctorate. But as his career took off, Eustace invested less and less time in the sport. Eventually, he sold his equipment.\n\nSkydiving from the stratosphere seemed like a drastic way to get back into practice. But the more he thought about it, the harder it was for him to imagine someone else doing it. His day job -- overseeing Google's engineers -- was all about building technology to solve problems and move people forward. Breaking the record would be a personal challenge, but more important, it would be a chance to push the boundaries of human experience. First, he'd need a suit.\n\nThe list of things that can go wrong when parachuting from extreme heights is nearly endless. The stratosphere is cold, for one -- the temperature can reach more than 100 degrees below zero. The air is also about 1,000 times thinner than at sea level, which means that without a pressurized suit, bodily fluids start to boil, creating gas bubbles that lead to mass swelling.\n\nThe environment is so hostile that high-altitude jumpers have to bring their own. For his record-breaking jump, Kittinger wore a partial-pressure suit -- a close-fitting garment with a network of thin inflatable tubes that squeeze the body to make up for the decrease in atmospheric pressure -- on top of four layers of clothing for warmth. On the way up, which took about an hour and a half, he rode in an open gondola that contained an oxygen supply, a communications system, altimeters, and the power source for his electrically heated gloves -- everything he needed to survive prolonged exposure to the altitude.\n\nBut gondolas present their own risks. In 1962, a Soviet air-force colonel named Pyotr Dolgov hit his head on the side of his gondola when he jumped from almost 94,000 feet, cracking the visor of his helmet and accidentally depressurizing his suit. He died before he hit the ground. A few years later, an amateur skydiver from New Jersey named Nick Piantanida was unable to switch from the oxygen supply in the gondola to the one attached to his suit when he reached his intended jump height of 123,500 feet, and had to abort the trip. (An unknown equipment malfunction on his next attempt would be fatal.)\n\nGondolas are also heavy. Baumgartner's team was using one that weighed almost 3,000 pounds. Ditching the gondola not only would be safer, Eustace figured, but would also allow him to start his jump from a greater height.\n\nBut nobody had ever attempted a stratosphere jump without one. If Eustace was going to rise 26 miles into the air attached to nothing but a helium balloon, he'd need a suit that would provide the same environmental protections -- oxygen, instruments, climate control -- that a gondola would. In short, he would need a space suit. The problem was that no one had designed or flown a new space suit in about 40 years. nasa has been using essentially the same version of the Apollo suit since the 1970s -- and Eustace couldn't just borrow one of those. He needed a suit that could survive a slow ascent into the stratosphere and a fast descent, with swift changes in temperature and velocity, and that could also support the weight of a giant parachute.\n\n1 | Balloon equipment module: Connects the balloon to the jumper. The module fires a small explosive to detach the jumper for descent.\n\n2 | Instrument panel: Displays oxygen-tank levels, suit pressure, and altitude.\n\n3 | Depressurization valve: The jumper pulls the safety loop and turns the valve to depressurize the suit, making it easier to steer in preparation for landing.\n\n4 | Parachute handles: Attached to cords that open the main and reserve parachutes.\n\n5 | Equipment-\u00admodule chest pack: Contains two oxygen tanks, radios, monitoring devices, and a thermal unit to heat the water that circulates through the suit to keep the jumper warm.\n\n6 | Mountaineering boots: Designed for expeditions on Mount Everest, climbing boots worn under the space suit protect from the extreme cold and can bear a load of more than 400 pounds on landing.\n\nEustace began to dedicate his nights and weekends to thinking about the design. He was still working 80-hour weeks at Google, but he had a lot of vacation time saved up, and his bosses -- Brin and Page -- were encouraging. A saying inside the company was that employees should have \"a healthy disrespect for the impossible.\"\n\nEustace's wife, Kathy Kwan, was less enthusiastic. The couple had two daughters, 11 and 16, and she knew the history of the sport. Eustace was so engrossed in the technological challenges that the possibility of death didn't really enter his mind -- any risk, he thought, could be mitigated by enough advance preparation. The couple made an uneasy truce: Kwan would support Eustace's project, and he would avoid bringing it up -- no stratosphere talk at the dinner table. (Kwan politely declined to speak with me, saying she preferred not to dredge up those particular memories.)\n\nIn October 2011, a contact in the aviation industry connected Eustace with a married couple named Taber MacCallum and Jane Poynter, co-founders of Paragon Space Development. MacCallum and Poynter had been two of the eight crew members on the famous Biosphere 2 project of the early '90s, living in a sealed artificial world for two years to determine whether humans could survive in closed ecosystems beyond Earth. They had started Paragon to create biological and chemical life-support systems for hazardous environments, like the deep sea and outer space.\n\nThe couple was used to getting calls from people asking all kinds of crazy things: Can you fly me into space? Would it be possible to strap me to a rocket? But this was the first time they'd heard anyone propose a stratosphere jump without a capsule. MacCallum was intrigued enough to set up a call with Eustace, and the two spoke for more than an hour. A week later, Eustace flew down to Paragon's headquarters, in Tucson, Arizona, and spent a day presenting his idea.\n\nMacCallum and Poynter soon agreed to lead Eustace's engineering team. They gathered the company's leading engineers, mechanics, and flight operators to work on the design, and commissioned ILC Dover -- the same manufacturing company that makes nasa's suits -- to build a prototype.\n\nEustace soon began making regular trips to Tucson for testing. The team put the suit in a wind tunnel and a vacuum chamber to determine how it would hold up in free fall. They hung Eustace from a nylon strap and spun him around so he could practice operating his equipment in midair. Next came a series of thermal tests, to ensure the suit could handle subzero temperatures. Eustace was suspended inside a sealed, liquid-nitrogen-cooled chamber for five hours at a time. Small tubes in the suit were supposed to circulate hot water around his limbs and chest to keep him warm. But the tubes ended at the wrists, meaning that, even with a pair of electrically heated mountain-climbing gloves, Eustace's hands eventually began to freeze. The team gave him a pair of oven mitts to wear on top of the gloves.\n\nIn October 2012, a year into Eustace's work with Paragon, Felix Baumgartner succeeded in breaking Kittinger's 1960 record, free-falling to Earth from a height of 127,852 feet. Reporters from all over the world came to witness the event, and a live webcast of the jump racked up more than 8 million views. Rather than deter Eustace, Baumgartner's jump gave him a test case. Shortly after exiting the capsule, Baumgartner entered a dangerous spin. He was able to right himself in time, but Eustace would be less agile in his suit and knew that he would need to figure out how to avoid the same problem.\n\nEustace and his team began doing dummy drops from airplanes in the Arizona desert. The test dummy, known as ida (for \"Iron Dummy Assemble\"), was made from welded high-pressure pipes, the kind used in industrial plumbing. She was dropped from various heights, equipped with a parachute that opened at a preset altitude. She spun wildly on her way down. One time, her arms and legs flew off.\n\nThe team tried to fix the problem by introducing a drogue -- a round parachute about six feet across that is supposed to add stability. The Coolidge jump, in May 2013, was Eustace's first chance to test the equipment himself. While nearly everything went wrong, the biggest problem remained spin. Eustace began spinning almost immediately after he left the plane, even with the drogue, and the suit was too rigid to allow him to correct himself midair the way he would during a skydive from a lower altitude.\n\nAfter the Coolidge jump, the team decided to raise the attachment point of the drogue, moving it from the seat of the suit to the back of the neck. That would make Eustace fall at a slight angle, and therefore not spin. To keep his arms from getting tangled up in the strings when the chute deployed, the engineers added a boom that would extend when the drogue opened and keep it at a safe distance from the suit. They called the system saeber.\n\nWhen the team tested the system on ida from 120,000 feet, her spinning slowed from 400 rpm to 22 rpm, a gentle pirouette. Eustace did more practice jumps, learning to stick out his elbows to correct himself in midair. They were finally ready.\n\nEustace woke up well before dawn on Friday, October 24, 2014, in a tin shed on an unused strip of land next to the airport in Roswell, New Mexico -- a site that had been chosen for its open space and relatively few cacti. The weather was perfect.\n\nHe spent two hours sitting in a vinyl recliner behind the shed breathing pure oxygen, to prevent decompression sickness. He drank water and Gatorade. Occasionally he stood and did some stretches to get nitrogen out of his tissues. Then he pulled on a diaper -- it would be a long ride up -- and was helped into his suit by four team members. They attached two GoPros to his chest and wheeled him out to the launchpad on a dolly.\n\nKwan had chosen to stay home. The girls had school that day -- Eustace and Kwan had decided to keep them on their normal schedule -- but had been granted permission to bring their phones to class so they could get updates from the launch site. The Paragon team and a single reporter from The New York Times would be the only onlookers.\n\nThe team strapped Eustace to a massive helium balloon -- 525 feet in diameter when fully inflated, roughly the size of a football stadium -- and untethered it from the launchpad. Just like that, Eustace was on his way. He felt relaxed, almost drowsy, as the balloon rose above the airport. He worried for a moment that he might fall asleep and miss the jump.\n\nAs Eustace drifted higher, he began to make out landmarks: New Mexico's White Sands, the Rocky Mountains. Crop circles became tiny specks. Whole states appeared and receded. At 70,000 feet, the sky darkened. Delicate cloud formations appeared below him. Eustace felt like he was floating above a lace doily. At 80,000 feet, the curvature of Earth became visible. He turned his head to look for the moon.\n\nOf course, he was also comparing his flight path to the projections, keeping an eye on the time and the stratospheric winds that were expected to kick in and push him east, and doing a mental rehearsal of the emergency procedures. At one point, Eustace stopped climbing fast enough, so ground control radioed him to let him know that it was releasing two 30-pound ballast weights. Each ballast had its own parachute, and he watched with interest as they fell back to Earth.\n\nAfter two hours and seven minutes, Eustace reached 135,890 feet. This was float altitude: The balloon had expanded as far as it could, so he would not rise farther. Ground control would now detach him by remote control. The countdown began. On \"zero,\" Eustace felt the balloon snap and drift off. For a single moment, he felt like he was hovering in midair. He did a backflip. Then he did another.\n\nThen saeber kicked in, launching the drogue and pushing Eustace into a downward position, facing Earth. The stratosphere was quiet as Eustace began free-falling, but soon he could hear the rush of air inside his helmet. He passed 822 miles an hour, breaking the speed of sound. At about 8,300 feet above the ground -- after four minutes and 27 seconds of free fall -- Eustace deployed his main parachute. Nine and a half minutes later, he landed with a smile on his face. His team rushed over, barely able to contain the whoops and yeahs. The record was his.\n\nThe Times reporter's story would not run until later that day, and Eustace's reception was decidedly more muted than Baumgartner's. After he was freed from the suit, he helped clean up the landing site, check the GoPro footage, and wrap up the parachute. That night, the whole team went to a Mexican restaurant in Roswell. Eustace was on his third margarita when he got a text from his sister, who was at a bar in Florida and, by some cosmic coincidence, had bumped into none other than Joseph Kittinger. Recognizing him, she went up to him and said, \"Hey, did you know that my brother just broke your record?\" Kittinger congratulated Eustace by phone the next day and invited him to have a beer sometime. Baumgartner, too, released a statement congratulating him.\n\nThe next Monday, Eustace was back behind his desk at Google.\n\nLast December, Eustace's suit was put on display at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in Chantilly, Virginia. In the two and a half years since the jump, Eustace has given countless talks about the suit -- at nasa, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, SpaceX. But most people still don't know that Eustace broke Baumgartner's record. \"If someone says, 'Hey, this is the guy who holds the record for the highest-altitude jump,'\u2009\" he told me, \"people will usually just turn to me and ask, 'Oh, are you Felix?'\u2009\"\n\nHe retired from Google a few months after the jump to focus on his own projects -- including consulting for a space-tourism company called World View, which MacCallum and Poynter helped form while Eustace was working on his jump. Ventures including SpaceX and Virgin Galactic have been working on ways to send civilians into space on rockets. World View is building an eight-person spacecraft that will float up into the stratosphere using a helium balloon, then detach and float back down with the help of a steerable parachute, like the one Eustace used. The trip will be significantly cheaper than going into space -- $75,000 a ticket compared with about $250,000 for a ride with Virgin Galactic -- which, if not quite democratizing the experience, will at least give more people an opportunity for perspective-altering views.\n\nInside World View's facility in Tucson sits a full-size replica of the Voyager capsule. It has four big windows and a bubble roof, so everyone on board can have a 360-degree view of space. The capsule has a small bathroom, Wi-Fi, and a bar. It will be a five-hour flight in total: one and a half hours up, then a couple of hours floating at about 100,000 feet before the descent. Eventually, World View hopes to hold wine tastings and photography classes in the stratosphere. The company is targeting late 2018 for its first flight.\n\nEustace isn't planning to go -- he feels it would be anticlimactic. He had hoped to venture out in his space suit again, but ultimately decided that another jump would put too much strain on his family. So he takes every other chance he gets to launch himself skyward.\n\nA few years after he started working as an engineer, Eustace bought a bright-yellow Lockwood AirCam, a small two-seater with an open cockpit. He took me to see it one blustery afternoon in December, in a private hangar at the San Carlos Airport. We drove there from Eustace's house in his Tesla, to which he had recently upgraded, at Kwan's urging, from a 2002 Honda Accord.\n\nI had confessed earlier that I was terrified of heights. \"Just don't scream too loudly in my ear when we're up there,\" he joked as we pulled up to the hangar. \"That could really make us crash.\"\n\nWe geared up: puffy pants and jackets and heavy helmets. Eustace helped strap me into the back seat, then jumped in the front. After a few radio calls to flight control, we pointed down the runway and took off. The plane lived up to its tagline -- slow and low -- and at first, it was almost like we were floating in a balloon. But as we got higher, flying over the tops of office buildings, the wind picked up. Although I was wearing gloves, my hands started getting numb. I thought about putting them in my pockets, but didn't want to let go of the sides of the plane, which I was gripping with all my strength. We rose higher and higher and banked right over the San Francisco Bay. The water glittered below us, the bridge stretching across the horizon.\n\nAfter about 20 minutes, I heard Eustace's voice in my ear: \"Do you want to take control?\" There was a small control stick in front of me, which Eustace had shown me how to use before we took off -- a slight pull to go higher, a push sideways to turn. Still holding on to the side of the plane with one hand, I used my other to tilt the stick slightly to the right. The plane tilted to the right. \"Oh!,\" I said, in genuine surprise, forgetting my fear for a moment. \"I'm flying!\"\n\nEustace just laughed. \"Go higher!\" he said.\n\nLaura Parker has written for The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, The New York Times, and Rolling Stone.

I love watching the majestic constellation Orion the Hunter and his gang of surrounding constellations like Taurus the Bull, Gemini the Twins, and several others. You can still see Orion and at least some of his posse hanging in the western sky after evening twilight, but they're checking out. It won't be long before Orion and company are already set below the western horizon before nightfall, not to be seen again until late next autumn.\n\nBefore Orion and company go on summer vacation, see if you can spot the minor constellation Lepus (pronounced Lee-pus) the Rabbit. What a name for that constellation. Someone had a sense of humor! Look for a group of fainter stars directly below Orion right after evening twilight in the very low southwest sky just above the horizon. In the countryside you'll see it more easily without the nasty urban lighting!\n\nIn Greek and Roman mythology, Lepus the Rabbit is a fun little story. It reminds me of the old Bugs Bunny-Elmer Fudd cartoons. Just like Elmer Fudd, Orion was a pretty good hunter. Orion could hunt down any beast on his island, no matter how large or ferocious it was. But, just like Mr. Fudd, there was one beast that always eluded the mighty hermit hunter and took great pleasure in harassing him. It's Orion's version of Bugs Bunny, Lepus the Rabbit.\n\nHere's what's up, Doc. Lepus was no ordinary pesky rabbit. He was a devil! That bad bunny would constantly taunt and tease Orion during his hunting adventures, jumping on his head, or biting the mighty hunter's butt just as he was about to launch a spear at a wild boar. Lepus also made a point of using Orion's sleeping bag as his toilet. Orion wanted desperately to do in this rabbit, but just like Bugs, Lepus was just too clever and fast.\n\nSadly, Orion never got to realize his dream of eliminating Lepus. The mighty hermit hunter met his demise when a giant scorpion attacked him.\n\nShortly afterward, Artemis, the goddess of hunting, lifted his body into the heavens and magically transfigured it into the constellation we see in the winter heavens. She wanted to be able to see him every night! She also placed his hunting dogs Canis Major and Canis Minor up there with him, along with, yes, that pesky rabbit Lepus. So that's what's up in the sky, Doc!","1072":"Skywatch: Changing of the stellar guard This April begins with an outstanding show in the early evening lower western sky! From April 1-5, the bright planet Venus, the brightest star-like object in the night sky, is going to travel from west to east across the Pleiades, the best and brightest star cluster in the heavens. To the naked eye the Pleiades resembles a tiny Big Dipper. On April 3, Venus will be right in the thick of the cluster sometimes referred to as the Seven Little Sisters, the daughters of the god Atlas. It's something you don't want to miss! You can certainly see this with unaided eyes, but binoculars or a small telescope can make it extra sweet! You'll see many more of the fainter stars in the Pleiades, and Venus will appear in the shape of a half-moon. Venus will be less than 53 million miles away, but the Pleiades are over 400 light-years away. Just one light equals almost 6 trillion miles!\n\nApril evenings are a little more comfortable for stargazers, but there are tradeoffs. With the later sunsets it's also a later start for your stargazing. Another tradeoff is that the winter constellations, the best and brightest in my opinion, are heading for the celestial exits. As April progresses, the mighty constellation Orion the Hunter and his gang of bright constellations begin evenings lower and lower in the western sky. Eventually, they'll disappear entirely from the evening sky until late next autumn.\n\nThe spring constellations are not as flashy, but they possess many celestial treasures. You just have to dig a little deeper for them. In the high southeastern sky look for a backward question mark that outlines the head and chest of the constellation Leo the Lion. The moderately bright star Regulus marks the \"period\" of the question mark. To the lower left of Regulus is a small but distinct triangle that makes up the lion's rear and tail. Much lower in the southeast sky is the small but distinct constellation Corvus the Crow. Look for a lopsided diamond hovering just above the horizon. It looks nothing like a crow, but it's still one of my favorite constellations.\n\nThe Big Dipper climbs higher and higher in the northeastern sky this month and is also gradually turning upside down. The Big Dipper is not an official constellation, but what's called an asterism that outlines the rear end and the tail of the constellation Ursa Major, the Big Bear. The Big Dipper is the brightest part of the beast.\n\nUse the two \"pointer stars\" that make up the side of the Big Dipper's pot opposite the handle to find Polaris, the North Star. Polaris is about three fist-widths at arm's length down and to the left from the pointer stars. Polaris holds court at the end of the handle of the Little Dipper, otherwise known as Ursa Minor, the Little Bear.\n\nOver in the lower eastern sky there's a sideways kite on the rise. It's the constellation Bootes, which, according to Greek mythology, is supposed to be a farmer hunting down neighboring Ursa Major, the Big Bear. At the tail of the kite is the super bright star Arcturus, with a distinct orange hue to it. If you extend the arc made by the Big Dipper's handle beyond the end of the handle, you'll run right into Arcturus. Just remember the old saying \"Arc to Arcturus.\"\n\nIn the early morning predawn southeastern sky there's an entertaining planet show going on featuring Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Jupiter is the brightest of the trio. On April 1 and 2, just before twilight, Saturn and Mars will be practically \"touching\" with Jupiter to the upper right of them.\n\nDon't miss it!","1073":"Skywatch: The hounds of heaven Even though it's now officially spring, there's plenty of winter left in the early evening skies. Part of the beautiful array of winter constellations are the two best-known dog constellations, Canis Major the Big Dog and Canis Minor the Little Dog. They've been on the prowl in the southern sky for many, many winter evenings chasing down a variety of prey. Before the winter constellations go on their summer vacation, get to know the hounds of the heavens!\n\nLike many constellations, these doggies are formally known by their traditional Latin names. \"Canis\" is the Latin word for dog, so Canis Major and Minor are the Big and Little Dogs, respectively. In Greek and Roman mythology, Canis Major and Minor are Orion's hunting dogs. When the hermit hunter Orion was killed in a fight with a giant Scorpion, his girlfriend Artemis, the goddess of the hunt, placed Orion's body in the heavens as the constellation we see today. She also placed his pet rabbit Lepus and his hunting dogs Canis Major and Minor in the sky to keep him company.\n\nCanis Major is standing on his hind legs to Orion's lower left in the southwestern sky. The brightest star in the entire night sky, Sirius, known as the dog star, is perched on the Big Dog's nose. Just extend a line to the lower left using the three bright stars in a row that make up Orion's belt and you'll run right into Sirius. Sirius is so bright in the sky because it's so close to us, only about eight light-years or 50 trillion miles from Earth. It's about 2 million miles in diameter, more than twice the diameter of our sun.\n\nRight next to Sirius is the star dryly dubbed by astronomers as Sirius B. It has a much more fun nickname though -- \"the Pup.\" A German astronomer discovered it in the early 1800s. The Pup and Sirius are described as a binary star system. These two stars, separated by somewhere between 1 billion and 3 billion miles, are revolving around each other every 50 years or so. About 150 million years ago, Sirius B was no pup at all. It was a much, much more massive star than Sirius. Some astronomers even think that at one time it was five times the diameter of our sun, and so bright that it could have cast shadows on Earth in the dark countryside. The problem with behemoths like Sirius B is that they don't live all that long, ripping through their hydrogen fuel at a reckless rate. Once its fuel was exhausted, Sirius B went through a series of steps and eventually lost all of its outer layers, leaving only its core. That makes the Pup a white dwarf star, no longer producing energy but remaining very hot. The Pup is estimated to be about the size of the Earth, around 8,000 miles in diameter. Sirius B is much denser and more massive than Earth, though, so much that it's estimated to have a surface gravity near 300,000 times that of Earth. If you weigh 200 pounds on Earth, you would tip the scales at more than 60 million pounds on the Pup!\n\nTo find the rest of Canis Major, look for a star just to the right of Sirius. That's a star called Mirzam, the front paw of the big dog. Then go back to Sirius and look down and to the left for a distinct triangle of stars that outline the dog's rear end, tail and hind leg. The star at the tip of the tail is Aludra, a monster-size star more than 100 million miles in diameter and almost 2,000 light-years away! Just one light-year equals about 6 trillion miles! Since it's so very far away, the light we see from Aludra has been traveling to us since around the time of the first Christmas. If Aludra were as close to us as Sirius, it would be the brightest celestial object in the nighttime sky, maybe even more brilliant than the moon! Whenever you gaze upon a star, keep in mind that two factors, size and distance, determine the brightness of a star. Just because a star is dim doesn't necessarily mean it's puny. It could be a monster many light-years away.\n\nThe Little Dog, Canis Minor, is tagging along to the upper left of Canis Major. Honestly, it's a poor excuse for a constellation. All there is to the Little Dog is a bright star called Procyon and a dimmer star just above it. It's a Chihuahua.\n\nIf you have any trouble locating Orion's hunting companions, you can use one of the great treasures in our winter sky. The \"Winter Triangle\" is an absolutely perfect triangle cornered by Betelgeuse, Procyon, and Sirius. Betelgeuse is the bright red-tinged star at Orion's armpit.\n\nTake an evening walk with the hounds of the heavens!","1074":"Small protein folds at the root of an ancient metabolic network This article requires a subscription to view the full text.

Biological electron transport, in turn, is catalyzed by a suite of enzymes that comprise the superfamily of oxidoreductases. The origin of oxidoreductases is enigmatic. Comparing protein topology and the sequence of modern oxidoreductases, we deduce a putative common ancestor that may have existed at the earliest stages of metabolism. Through duplication, recruitment of other proteins, and diversification, this ancestral protein may have evolved to facilitate electron transfer and redox catalysis at a very early stage in the origin of metabolism.","1075":"Small-molecule covalent bond formation at tyrosine creates a binding site and inhibits activation of Ral GTPases This article requires a subscription to view the full text.

Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of Ras mutants and all Ral proteins do not have an accessible cysteine residue. Screening of a covalent fragment library containing aryl sulfonyl fluorides led to the discovery of one compound class that formed a covalent bond with noncatalytic residue Tyr-82. Remarkably, a high-resolution crystal structure at 1.2-\u00c5 resolution revealed that the compound created a deep hydrophobic pocket that was never previously observed in Ras or Ral GTPases. This binding pocket has a SiteMap DrugScore that is identical to druggable kinase ATP-binding pockets, suggesting that it could be used to develop therapeutics targeting oncogenic Ras lacking cysteine.","1076":"Smoke Alarm Standards -- ahead of schedule This blog post was written by Seattle home inspector Charles Buell and was originally posted on his website on 1\/17\/2020.\n\nThe UL 217 standard for home smoke alarms has not changed very much since it started in 1976. The most recent adjustment (and significant adjustment) to this standard was published in 2015 and again on January 2, 2020. All smoke alarms manufactured after June 1, 2021 will be required to meet this standard. They will be more responsive to multiple types of fire scenarios and help reduce some of the shortcomings of current alarms.\n\nWhile this post started out as an announcement of the adoption of the new standard and the availability of new life-saving technology, it turned out to be a bit more complicated as manufacturers seem to have dragged their feet in ways that have repeatedly put off implementation of the standard.\n\nThe move to improving the function of smoke alarms started with the 2015 UL 217, 8 Edition, but only one manufacturer has been approved under the new standard. There was also the problem of UL having to build a whole new facility to do the testing in. The new UL 217 is Edition 9 and may cause yet another push out of the effective date as manufacturers scramble to comply with Edition 9. Kidde's UL 217, 8 Edition approved model will now have to be retested to make sure it complies with Edition 9 that just came out.\n\nNote from Reuben: the new smoke alarm that complies with UL 217 8th Edition is the TruSense made by Kidde. The manufacturer says it has a new 'optical' sensor, but I've been told by industry insiders that this is simply a fancy term for multiple photoelectric sensors.\n\nNuisance tripping related to cooking has been addressed, and they are now more sensitive to smoldering types of fires related to synthetic materials in modern homes.\n\nThe new technology will also allow for Combination Smoke\/CO Alarms -- something that was problematic with old technology alarms.\n\nWell of course it matters, and the fact that it is taking so long to get available technology in place is nothing but a shame.\n\nFor the home inspector, this amounts to quite a dilemma, because I am sure there will be builders installing the old technology alarms on May 28, 2021. With a 10 year life, the house will not likely see the new technology until 2031. Considering the technology has been available since 2015, and some alarms that complied with this standard since 2019, that amounts to several years of preventable deaths.\n\nNote from Reuben: not only that, but the existing inventory of old smoke alarms can still be sold and installed. The old smoke alarms will be around for a long time after the new standard takes effect.\n\nWhile it will be some time before current stocks are sold, I personally do not recommend purchasing anything that does not have the new listing. I will do my part to make sure none of the old technology alarms leave the stores. I love tilting at windmills.\n\nIf new technology alarms cannot be found, the best practice is to use photoelectric type alarms which approach 95% as good as the new technology. This is what the new ones are basically anyway.\n\nThe Kidde TruSense alarms can be found in home improvement stores and online. The packaging will carry a label that looks something like the one below.\n\nWhile these alarms do not likely meet UL 217 9 Edition, they do at least meet UL 217, 8 Edition and are a better choice than old technology ionization alarms that are currently available. Another conundrum, in some states you can buy older alarms but cannot legally install them.\n\nFor me, I will be recommending replacement\/installation (even at the current date) of any alarm that is not the new technology -- other than photoelectric type alarms. I will not be waiting until the arbitrary date of June 1st, 2021 when conditions somehow mysteriously and magically get worse. The physics do not change.\n\nWe have the technology now, let's make our homes safer now -- ahead of schedule.\n\nCharles Buell, Real Estate Inspections in Seattle","1077":"Smriti Mandhana Says \"Failure Teaches You More Than Success\" After India's Women's T20 World Cup Loss | Cricket News Senior India player Smriti Mandhana called for the team to be left alone after its 85-run mauling by Australia in the ICC Women's T20 World Cup final in Melbourne on Sunday. Unbeaten throughout the tournament, India were outplayed in all departments of the game by the defending champions, who clinched their fifth world title in the shortest format. \"This is a time to introspect. Failure teaches you a lot more than success. The team needs to be left alone and think of how we can be better in the next few years,\" Mandhana said after the match.\n\nA sluggish start with the ball and in the field undermined India's attempts to overhaul the defending champions in their own backyard with the support of a 86,174 crowd at the iconic MCG.\n\nMandhana believed India are a transformed team in the shortest format, and she attributed it to head coach WV Raman.\n\n\"T20 was never our best format, one-day was definitely the preferred format. Now we're playing each format equally well. That is one thing the coach has helped us with and we've developed massively,\" she said.\n\n\"The youngsters coming in have totally changed the set-up and the best part of the tournament was it was a complete team performance. That's one thing Raman has done -- developing us as a team not just one or two players. Today, it didn't work out but we've grown as a team, not just as one or two players.\"\n\nMandhana's disappointing T20 World Cup -- that saw her manage a top score of 17 in four innings -- continued as India sunk to 99 all out. She also revealed she told a tearful Shafali Verma to be \"really proud\" of her performances despite a devastating final.\n\nTeen sensation Verma was distraught after getting out for two with the bat and drooping Alyssa Healy on nine.\n\n\"Shafali and I were standing together when we were receiving our medals. She was in tears. I told her she had to be really proud of the kind of campaign she'd had. When I played my first World Cup at the age of 16, I couldn't hit the ball 20 per cent of what she can hit,\" said Mandhana.\n\n\"She has to be really proud of the way she played, but she was upset with the way she got out. She's thinking already how she can be better. She should be left alone, that's the most I can tell her.\"","1078":"Snowpiercer TV Show Release Date Moved Forward(!) Two Weeks In a world where movies are being delayed up to an entire year, it's refreshing to get some news that we'll be getting something earlier than expected. TNT's Snowpiercer, which is based on a French comic that was also adapted into a Bong Joon-ho film in 2013, has moved forward two weeks, changing its premiere date from May 31 to May 17.\n\nThe concept behind Snowpiercer is a classic bit of science fiction. The world has frozen over and the only surviving humans live in a perpetually moving train with 1,001 cars that circles the globe. The setup provides for a microcosm of society as class warfare, politics, and other societal issues play out in the confined space. Like all the best science fiction, it takes a big concept and uses it to address humanity on the whole. That's probably what attracted Bong Joon-ho to the story and why TNT picked it up to adapt again so close to Bong's film.\n\nTNT didn't give an exact reason for the series being moved forward, but Brett Weitz, general manager for TNT, TBS, and truTV, said that they were trying to meet audiences where they are. That, of course, means in their homes for the foreseeable future as most of the world continues its quarantine. With advertisers fleeing from every platform, TNT is probably also looking for a way to entice them back with a (hopefully) hit show.\n\nSnowpiercer has a stellar cast with Tony-winner Daveed Diggs, Oscar-winner Jennifer Connelly, Emmy-nominee Alison Wright, Mickey Sumner, and Tony Award-winner and Grammy-nominee Lena Hall all starring.","1079":"So, I apologized to someone on FB In a local FB group, debate gets very heated re: politics and this whole situation going on in the world.

To date, the molecular mechanisms leading to intestinal barrier defects are not well understood, and there are no available therapeutic approaches to target intestinal barrier function. Here we show that soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) could be a novel therapeutic target of obesity-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction and LPS\/bacterial translocation, and that sEH inhibitors, which have been evaluated in human clinical trials targeting other disorders, could be promising agents for prevention or treatment.\n\nIntestinal barrier dysfunction, which leads to translocation of bacteria or toxic bacterial products from the gut into bloodstream and results in systemic inflammation, is a key pathogenic factor in many human diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to intestinal barrier defects are not well understood, and there are currently no available therapeutic approaches to target intestinal barrier function. Here we show that soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is an endogenous regulator of obesity-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction. We find that sEH is overexpressed in the colons of obese mice. In addition, pharmacologic inhibition or genetic ablation of sEH abolishes obesity-induced gut leakage, translocation of endotoxin lipopolysaccharide or bacteria, and bacterial invasion-induced adipose inflammation. Furthermore, systematic treatment with sEH-produced lipid metabolites, dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids, induces bacterial translocation and colonic inflammation in mice. The actions of sEH are mediated by gut bacteria-dependent mechanisms, since inhibition or genetic ablation of sEH fails to attenuate obesity-induced gut leakage and adipose inflammation in mice lacking gut bacteria. Overall, these results support that sEH is a potential therapeutic target for obesity-induced intestinal barrier dysfunction, and that sEH inhibitors, which have been evaluated in human clinical trials targeting other human disorders, could be promising agents for prevention and\/or treatment.","1084":"Some LTC drivers refuse passengers in wheelchairs LONDON, ONT. -- A dispute over COVID-19 concerns for London Transit Commission (LTC) drivers came to a head over the weekend after a number of drivers refused to allow people in wheelchairs to board buses, CTV News has learned.\n\nOne of those people was Penny Moore, who says when she tried to take the bus to go shopping she was refused - not by one, but by two different drivers on separate buses.\n\n\"The bus driver there opened the door and started yelling at me and said 'Do you know about the new rules?'

Other times, there are other incidents where an image falls short of technical perfection but still finds a way to my list of favorites.\n\nOne common thread through all of the below examples is that they make for a technically imperfect photograph. In addition, I must admit that much of it is based on film photography. Sure, some of these things can happen in digital photography (sans light leaks), but I find that they are far more infrequent. For film photographers, however, quirky mishaps with the film are par for the course and are often quite beautiful. That is not to say that they universally enhance images; however, embracing the spontaneity of the universe as it is captured in one photograph can be a beautiful thing. I should note that I have been made aware that there are phone apps and techniques in Photoshop that can mimic some of the below effects; however, I am not entirely convinced that someone could completely emulate the randomness of some of the below examples in a way that is completely convincing.\n\nMisfires\n\nI should probably be more careful about keeping my finger away from the shutter button when I'm not framing a shot. Probably. Alas, I am pretty reckless about it. As a natural consequence of my trigger finger positioning, every now and again, I get a misfire. Oops! I would probably find it more frustrating if I didn't actually end up liking the end result as often as I do. There are few ways for a photo to be more candid photo than when you never intended to take it in the first place. In that sense of genuine candor, I find honesty. In that honesty, I find a sense of beauty and authenticity that is difficult to recreate.\n\nOut of Focus\/Motion Blur\n\nAside from misfires, there are also out of focus photographs. In shooting manual focus lenses, the occasional photo where the focus was missed ever so slightly comes with the territory. The likeliness of this is of course exacerbated when using a fast telephoto lens. While they can sometimes be frustrating, I still find a lightness to them that I quite like. Further, an out of focus (could I argue that it's in fact \"soft focus?\") portrait that is bound to show up after a portrait session shooting film can convey a sense of ease and lack of intensity.\n\nLens Flare\n\nLens flare is often seen as a deficiency in lens coatings or the optical formula and often look like garbage. There are times, though, when the stars align and the lens flare is actually quite beautiful, adding a sense of airiness and depth to a photograph that could otherwise seem a bit sterile. I'll admit that I'm partial to lenses where flares are not a problem given that the vast majority of the time, inadequate coatings ruin an image rather than making it. As such, I cannot think of any examples from images I've taken that fall into this category, but I can honestly say that I've seen examples that really struck me.\n\nComposition and Framing\n\nMy girlfriend would argue that in fact, composition and framing are two distinct concepts, and when she argues it, I couldn't agree more. Though, admittedly, by the next day, I'm back to thinking this is a distinction without a difference. That point aside, there are times when the framing of an image was just off for one reason or another, and the majority of the time, it can look like amateur hour, while at other times, much like I mentioned in the section on misfires, it can come across as being candid or genuine.\n\nUnder\/Overexposure\n\nIn all honesty, I cannot think of a single example of overexposure leading to a beautifully imperfect image. I probably have one somewhere in my photograph library, but I cannot think of one off the top of my head. Underexposed images, on the other hand, often come up in my experience. While I try my best to avoid such situations, when shooting film during dusk or inside on a gloomy day, shooting underexposed is bound to happen. At least for me, I don't tend to push the boundaries of underexposure unless I'm shooting black and white. Even then, if I find myself shooting color negative film three or more stops underexposed, I will most likely make the image black and white in post, as otherwise, it starts introducing too much saturation and sometimes color shifts or incorrect white balance. For black and white photographs specifically, the rich blackness of a massively underexposed area mixed with isolated light can create a really beautiful dynamic.\n\nLight Leaks (First of the Roll)\n\nLight leaks have actually ruined images I would have otherwise loved. For some reason (and maybe this is more user error than anything else), if the light leak falls on the border of my frame, both my scanner's software and the Negative Lab Pro really struggle to get the colors right. Almost always, it just looks terrible. With that said, if the light leak falls within the frame, it creates a bright orange streak through the photograph. Light leaks are pretty uncommon for me, and I would go to great lengths to prevent them if there were any rhyme or reason as to when they show up; alas, sometimes, I'll get multiple on the same roll, and I'll go 10 or more rolls before I get another one without any discernable similarity in circumstances.\n\nAccidental Multiple Exposure\n\nThe vast majority of the time this happens to me, it's on my Mamiya RB67 when I've forgotten to advance the film (it's easier to do than it sounds). In another circumstance, I would get accidental quadruple exposures on my Nikon F2. I don't know if it was just my specific F2 or what, but the rewind button has two settings. The shallower option gives a double exposure, and pressing the button completely down gives a triple exposure. I've also accidentally shot through part of a roll in my F100 and pulled the film out (after rewinding it of course) early to change film stocks. When I reloaded it, I couldn't remember where I left off, so I had a few overlapping images. While I did not care much for any of the latter images, I thought some of my accidental quadruple exposures turned out alright.\n\nWhat About You?\n\nHave you ever taken a photo that you know was either technically imperfect or that did not fit your brief for a hired shoot? Do you have any thoughts or opinions on what I've mentioned above? Do you think I left something off the list? Your photos and thoughts are welcome.","1087":"Some of the 'Sister Wives' Stars Are Actually Related: Get Details According to the outlet, Kody and Christine aren't just spouses. Radar cited an Ancestry.com tree that shows the two of them share William Moore Allred and Orissa Angela Bates as relatives, making them distant cousins. It's not like they grew up going to Thanksgiving and sitting at the kids' table together, but it's still a little odd.\n\nBut it gets weirder. Kody and Janelle share daughter Maddie, and she's married to Caleb Brush. Caleb is Maddie's aunt's brother\/the brother of Kody's sister-in-law, Erica Brush Brown. So, at least they're not blood-related.\n\nAnd that's not all! Radar also reported back in October 2015 that Janelle was previously married to Adam Clark Barber -- the brother of Meri, Kody's first wife. That means Janelle and Meri were sisters-in-law before they became sister wives. Janelle actually fell in love with her first husband's brother-in-law while she was still married to that first husband. Her old TLC bio used to read, \"I met Kody in the fall of 1989, even though he may not remember it. When he walked into the room I looked at him and had that feeling of remembering something I had forgotten. It was a singular experience.\" Kody and Janelle were not \"spiritually married\" until 1993.\n\nKody is only legally married to one of his four wives, Robyn. Kody was formerly legally married to Meri, his first wife, but they legally divorced in 2014. He then married Robyn so that he could legally adopt her three children from a previous marriage.

This technique has been used previously to open the blood-brain barrier (BBB) to facilitate the delivery of therapeutics to the surrounding brain tissue. However, disruption of the BBB may be contraindicated in certain disease contexts. Here, we utilize low-pressure FUS to oscillate the MBs just enough to transfect endothelial cells, without opening the BBB. The low-pressure FUS regimen results in enhanced gene delivery to endothelial cells, with none of the inflammatory or immune pathway up-regulation observed at higher FUS pressures.\n\nTreatment of many pathologies of the brain could be improved markedly by the development of noninvasive therapeutic approaches that elicit robust, endothelial cell-selective gene expression in specific brain regions that are targeted under MR image guidance. While focused ultrasound (FUS) in conjunction with gas-filled microbubbles (MBs) has emerged as a noninvasive modality for MR image-guided gene delivery to the brain, it has been used exclusively to transiently disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB), which may induce a sterile inflammation response. Here, we introduce an MR image-guided FUS method that elicits endothelial-selective transfection of the cerebral vasculature (i.e., \"sonoselective\" transfection), without opening the BBB. We first determined that activating circulating, cationic plasmid-bearing MBs with pulsed low-pressure (0.1 MPa) 1.1-MHz FUS facilitates sonoselective gene delivery to the endothelium without MRI-detectable disruption of the BBB. The degree of endothelial selectivity varied inversely with the FUS pressure, with higher pressures (i.e., 0.3-MPa and 0.4-MPa FUS) consistently inducing BBB opening and extravascular transfection. Bulk RNA sequencing analyses revealed that the sonoselective low-pressure regimen does not up-regulate inflammatory or immune responses. Single-cell RNA sequencing indicated that the transcriptome of sonoselectively transfected brain endothelium was unaffected by the treatment. The approach developed here permits targeted gene delivery to blood vessels and could be used to promote angiogenesis, release endothelial cell-secreted factors to stimulate nerve regrowth, or recruit neural stem cells.","1090":"Sony clarifies that PS5 will support 'overwhelming majority' of PS4 games Sony has issued an update to clarify its stance on backwards compatibility for the PlayStation 5, saying the upcoming console will support an \"overwhelming majority\" of the 4,000-plus existing PS4 titles. Prior to the update, Sony's Mark Cerny, the system architect for the PS5 who detailed its full hardware specifications in a live-streamed presentation on Wednesday, said the console would support \"almost all\" of the top 100 PS4 titles.\n\n\"A quick update on backward compatibility -- With all of the amazing games in PS4's catalog, we've devoted significant efforts to enable our fans to play their favorites on PS5,\" Sony writes in the update text, which it posted at the top of its tech specs announcement post from two days ago. \"We believe that the overwhelming majority of the 4,000+ PS4 titles will be playable on PS5.\"\n\nSony also says those older titles may run better on the newer system, too. \"We're expecting backward compatible titles will run at a boosted frequency on PS5 so that they can benefit from higher or more stable frame rates and potentially higher resolutions,\" the company adds. \"We're currently evaluating games on a title-by-title basis to spot any issues that need adjustment from the original software developers.\"\n\nSony says Cerny \"provided a snapshot into the Top 100 most-played PS4 titles\" simply as demonstration of the company's current backwards compatibility efforts. \"We have already tested hundreds of titles and are preparing to test thousands more as we move toward launch,\" the company says. \"We will provide updates on backward compatibility, along with much more PS5 news, in the months ahead.\"\n\nThis should hopefully clear up some confusion as to the extent of Sony's backwards compatibility commitment. Some fans were concerned the PS5 would not have the same level of last-gen compatibility as Microsoft's upcoming Xbox Series X. Considering the heated competition between the two devices -- fans of both are already vigorously debating which is going to be the better purchase and more successful platform -- Xbox fans started taking a bit of a victory lap with regard to the Series X's support for older games.\n\nThat said, Microsoft is still quite far ahead in terms of broader backlog support due to its many years of backward compatibility work. While the PS5 and Xbox Series X sound as if they'll both support the previous generation of hardware, Microsoft's Xbox chief Phil Spencer said last month that Xbox Series X would support \"four generations of Xbox,\" meaning from the original system all the way through to the latest hardware.\n\n\"Our commitment to compatibility means existing Xbox One games, including backward-compatible Xbox 360 and original Xbox games, look and play better than ever before,\" Spencer wrote in a blog post. \"Your favorite games, including titles in Xbox Game Pass, benefit from steadier framerates, faster load times and improved resolution and visual fidelity -- all with no developer work required. Your Xbox One gaming accessories also come forward with you.\"\n\nInstead of taking this route, Sony has opted instead for supporting older games through its PlayStation Now cloud gaming service. That said, those worried the PS5 wouldn't be able to play PS4 discs, or that their digital libraries wouldn't be able to move with them, should be able to rest easy now.","1091":"Soup! Breadsticks!

But it needs to act now The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations\n\nSouth Africa needs to seriously start thinking about shifting its energy focus. This is for two reasons.\n\nThe first is that the country's important exports - coal and platinum - face potential collapse with the imminent shift of global energy markets. A number of factors are driving this.\n\nThe move away from vehicles powered by petrol and diesel to ones powered by electric batteries is gathering pace. Two thirds of the demand for platinum depends on combustion engines where it is used for the hardening of spark plug tips and in vehicle exhaust auto-catalysts.\n\nThe second major reason that the country needs to refocus its energy situation is there's a major switch from coal to renewables underway in the world. And South Africa itself can't continue its current levels of dependency on coal. South Africa is the 14th largest emitter of carbon dioxide, and on a per capita basis, the 10th largest emitter. It leads the pack in Africa, and already faces considerable environmental issues in Mpumalanga, where state energy provider Eskom's coal fired power stations and Sasol's coal-to-liquid plant are located.\n\nSasol and Eskom account for more than 50% of the country's carbon emissions.\n\nIt can address both these challenges by pursuing a feasible solution waiting to be exploited. The country could make use of its natural comparative advantages in wind and solar power to generate electricity. By linking these accessible resources to technologies such as Fischer-Tropsch, it's in an ideal position to open another chapter in export-led economic development.\n\nThe Fischer-Tropsch technology was developed to exploit coal by converting the mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen - produced by heating coal at high temperature in a process known as gasification - to liquid fuels. The process was introduced into South Africa in the 1950s to reduce the country's reliance on imported oil. Sasol is now a global leader in the technology and has more experience than any other company in the conversion of hydrocarbon gas to liquid fuels.\n\nMoving in this direction also presents a golden opportunity for South Africa to transition from being a key contributor to global warming to becoming a key contributor to global emissions reductions.\n\nThe technology\n\nSouth Africa can use its supply of solar and wind to produce hydrogen from water in a process known as hydrolysis. A cheap and reliable source of hydrogen is essential for the production of green fuels. To date, this technology has been too expensive. But advances in fuel cells have made large-scale hydrogen production cheaper and more accessible. More importantly, if the hydrogen is made with renewable energy, it is a \"green\" feedstock.\n\nThe green hydrogen can then be combined with carbon, captured from existing flue gas or from the air, to make liquid fuels and petrochemicals using Fischer-Tropsch technology. The present Sasol technology relies on coal as the source of carbon and is unsustainable. The possible innovation - which South Africa is in a prime position to exploit - will be to combine green carbon with green hydrogen to make liquid fuel.\n\nThere are substantial export opportunities for such \"green\" fuels and petrochemicals. This market could generate export revenue to replace lost revenues from declining coal and platinum exports.\n\nThe green hydrogen could also substitute fertiliser and explosives imports. About 60% of South Africa's fertiliser is presently imported. The hydrogen could be combined with nitrogen from the air to make ammonia using the well-established Haber process, and the ammonia then converted firstly to ammonium nitrate and then to fertiliser and explosives.\n\nThe hydrogen step undertaken with fuel cells would create local demand for platinum because the metal is used as the catalyst in hydrogen fuel cells. In addition, the renewable power stations could provide cheap power to supplement Eskom's constrained supply.\n\nThese new industries would have two knock-on effects: they would create jobs and the would move the country towards zero carbon emissions.\n\nThe jet fuel opportunity\n\nOne of the \"green fuels\" that has huge potential is jet fuel.\n\nThe aviation industry is under intense pressure to find alternatives to fossil fuels and reduce its emissions. This isn't surprising. The total global market for aviation fuel is about $300 billion and air travel accounts for 2.5% of the global carbon emissions. This is equivalent to 900 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. This value could triple by 2050 and consume 25% of the global carbon budget.\n\nThis demand could be replaced entirely by the advent of green liquid fuels, produced from green hydrogen and carbon captured from the atmosphere.\n\nThe market for green aviation fuel is an attractive possibility for South Africa. To date, a viable solution has not been possible. Now, this outlook has changed with the possibility of fuel-cell hydrogen and technologies for carbon capture.\n\nThree other technologies also matter: wind and solar power, as well as Fischer Tropsch technology. These are all well established in South Africa. The country's renewable power bidding rounds have shown wind and solar power to be the lowest cost source of power. And Sasol has been operating Fischer Tropsch reactors for over 50 years.\n\nUnfortunately, South Africa's public-funded research and development efforts have been directed mainly into how to use hydrogen, instead of how to make hydrogen. It has been focused on using hydrogen to beneficiate platinum (processing it to enhance its properties) for vehicle fuel cells instead of concentrating on finding a commercial source of hydrogen which could be used in multiple applications. For its part, Sasol has made a substantial research and development effort, but it is not looking at lowering the costs of hydrolysis.\n\nGovernment should shift the focus of research and development spending in partnership with Sasol to tackle this challenge and open a new cleaner, greener chapter in South Africa's history.\n\nInternationally several pilot facilities are in construction or are being planned. But they don't have South Africa's natural advantage in wind and solar resources. Nor do they have South Africa's experience with Fischer Tropsch technology.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nSouth Africa has key ingredients it should be exploiting to fill an export gap, and to reduce emissions. It should seize a first-mover advantage.\n\nBut will the South African government and Sasol make the necessary moves? Given the potential for local employment, rescuing the platinum industry, reducing the country's carbon emissions and earning much needed foreign exchange, it seems a logical decision.","1094":"South Africa vs Australia: All-Round South Africa Clinch ODI Series 3-0 Against Australia | Cricket News South Africa completed a 3-0 series whitewash over Australia with a 6-wicket win in the third ODI at Potchefstroom.

Many Republicans who swept rural Democrats out of office in this month's elections now confront a harsh reality of their promises to reduce government spending: whether to cut the farm subsidies that bring money and jobs to their districts _ and even their own bank accounts. (AP Photo\/Dirk Lammers, File)\n\nThere appears to be a wide range of opinion on how we should be handling the pandemic, from absolute quarantine to \"let's get back to work and let the chips fall where they may.\"\n\nWhile most governmental leaders in the U.S. are imposing lockdowns of one sort or another, Republican Gov. Kristi Noem is refusing to shut down South Dakota.\n\nAt a press conference Wednesday, Kristi eschewed a one-size-fits-all approach to the pandemic (and governance across the country).\n\nDuring this present viral threat, she's interested in a different kind of protection -- that of individual rights:\n\n\"Our constitution ensures that the citizen's right is protected. I agree with the role of our government as set forth in our state and in our national constitution. I took an oath to uphold these constitutions.\"\n\nShe's interested in public safety, AKA people's responsibility:\n\n\"My role with respect to public safety is something I take very seriously. The people themselves are primarily responsible for their safety. They are the ones that are entrusted with expansive freedoms - they are free to exercise their rights to work, worship, and play - or to stay at home, or to conduct social distancing.\"\n\nThat's quite a novel take among many in her position.\n\nKristi called what she's doing \"leadership,\" as opposed to something very different:\n\n\"The calls to apply a one-size-fits all approach to this problem in South Dakota is herd mentality, not leadership.\"\n\nImportant to note are the COVID-19 stats in South Dakota. By way of comparison, at the time of this writing, hotbed New York City has had 130,689 total cases, with a death rate per million people of 243. South Dakota's seen 288 cases total, with a rate of fatality per million of 5.\n\nThat's quite a contrast, which certainly goes some distance in bolstering her anti-one-size-fits-all way of thinking.\n\n\"South Dakota is not New York City, the governor said. \"And our sense of personal responsibility, our resiliency, and our already-sparse population density put us in a great position to manage the spread of this virus without needing to resort to some of the measures that we've seen in some of these major cities, coastal cities, and in other countries.\"\n\nShe further explained:\n\n\"My responsibility is to respect the rights of the people who elected me, and to manage our state operations in a way that reflects the realities of what we have here on the ground here. On the foundation of my principles, commonsense conservative values, and the principles we hold dear in America, the facts, the science, and the data will guide our decision-making here in South Dakota.\"\n\nKristi's comments, as well as her use of the word \"herd,\" reminds me of something I saw on \"herd immunity.\"\n\nHere's a bit more about that concept, from Massachusetts's South Shore Health Chief of Infectious Disease Dr. Todd Ellerin, courtesy of ABC News:\n\n\"What stops a virus, what breaks the chain, is if enough people get infected and those people develop immunity. In fact, if enough people get infected, the virus can't replicate in that host. ... If you have immunity, you can't get infected because the antibodies swarm like an army.\"\n\n\"Herd immunity,\" the article indicated, \"would mean that enough people have an exposure that then protects people who either would be at high risk or can't get vaccinated once one is approved.\"\n\nAt the time of ABC's report, however, it was noted that there's too much left to learn about COVID-19 in order to properly discern how herd immunity may or may not work.\n\nIt's an interesting topic. Forbes recently ran a piece titled \"Caught Between Herd Immunity And National Lockdown, The Netherlands Hit Hard By Covid-19.\"\n\nAll things considered, what do you think of Washington's guidelines so far?

Custom PC sales in the first quarter increased by 32% compared to that of the first quarter of 2019. DANAWA experienced its biggest March sales ever. South Korean companies such as Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics and foreign companies such as ASUS are also enjoying increased sales. They are also seeing increased demands for webcams that are needed for online lecture and video conference.\n\nWhile PC sales are normally concentrated in February before schools start in March, demands for PCs were concentrated in March this year as the first day of school has been postponed to April. Ever elementary, middle, and high schools will start their semesters online starting from the 9th until the 30th of this month.\n\nIt is interesting to see increased sales have taken place especially in economic and middle-end products. While PCs that are priced at $1,230 (1.5 million KRW) had been the most popular items on DANAWA, IdeaPads that cost less than $408 (500,000 KRW) have been the most popular items after schools decided to start their first days of semester online. Because households with many children have to purchase additional PCs besides the ones that they already have, it is burdensome for them to buy another expensive item.\n\nPC makers have also focused on advertising economic and middle-end products that are suitable for online learning in addition to their traditional academy marketing.\n\n\"First day of school taking place online and increased number of people who are telecommuting have had huge impact on the PC market.\" said a representative for DANAWA. \"There has been a rapid increase in number of people who purchased economic and middle-end products in a hurry in order to deal with digital transformation.\"\n\nThere have been setbacks to supplies of products as orders have been flooding in.\n\n\"It has been difficult for us to secure parts and supply our products without any much issue as our plants in China have not been on normal operations.\" said a representative for a PC maker. \"It takes up to one month for one to order and receive a product.\"\n\nStaff Reporter Kim, Yongjoo | kyj@etnews.com & Staff Reporter Park, Sora | srpark@etnews.com","1097":"Southwest Airlines flight attendant sings positive message as encouragement during uncertain times During these times of much uncertainty and calamity, an inspiring flight attendant has some encouraging advice for us all.\n\nSouthwest Airlines flight attendant Charise Miles sent ABC13 a video of herself singing Bobby McFerrin's famous song, 'Don't Worry, Be Happy,' while getting ready for work.\n\nListen to her rendition above and let the positive message remind you to take a moment to not worry, but be happy instead.","1098":"Specialized cytonemes induce self-organization of stem cells Edited by Janet Rossant, Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada, and approved February 21, 2020 (received for review November 27, 2019)\n\nMany questions about how stem cells communicate with neighboring cells and self-organize to initiate tissue formation remain unanswered. We uncovered mechanisms employed by embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and trophoblast stem cells (TSCs) to coform embryo-like structures. We describe ESC-generated cytonemes that react to self-renewal-promoting Wnt ligands secreted by TSCs. We identified glutamatergic activity upon formation of ESC-TSC interaction. This cellular connection is required for the transmission of Wnt signals to ESCs for Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin pathway activation, a process that regulates morphogenesis. Given that many stem cell types express glutamate receptors and rely on niche-secreted Wnt ligands for self-renewal, we propose that Wnt and glutamatergic signaling crosstalk may prove prevalent in various mammalian tissues to regulate stem cell-niche interactions.","1099":"Sponsored:  Enchanting Montclair midcentury view home Welcome to this midcentury three-plus-bedroom, three-bathroom home located in the desirable Montclair Hills neighborhood of Oakland.\n\nThis home is sited above the street on a large 10,000-plus-square-foot lot providing sunny outlooks and bay views with lovely features such as hardwood floors, dramatic cathedral ceilings with an open floor plan and easy inside-outside flow.\n\nThe main level contains a dramatic open living room and dining L, eat-in kitchen and three bedrooms including a master suite with a steam shower and a second hallway bathroom.

Five women at lunch on a workday -- this was about a dozen years ago -- comparing recent life notes and for a moment we landed on sinks. I said I can\u02bct stand it when my kitchen sink is dirty. I empty the little basket around the drain, I get a piece of paper towel, thump the basket, wipe it, throw the wad away.\n\nIt\u02bcs pretty picky of me. The whole rest of the house can be near collapse with belongings everywhere, windows so dusty I can barely see out, and yet, the thing that I must have sparkling clean and white is my kitchen sink.\n\nBut guess what? Carol said she\u02bcs the same way. She keeps a clean sink all the time. Martha said she just throws bits directly in the garbage. I said I don\u02bct use the garbage disposal anymore, our sewer guy told me not to. \"Yeah,\" someone agreed, \"they really aren\u02bct worth the trouble.\"\n\nAnet said that the problem is the kids, and she\u02bcs right. Both my kids were living at home right then. They used the sink, the stove, the refrigerator, the food about two dozen times a day. Carol, whose kids all lived away, said sometimes they come over. One told her she\u02bcd sure gotten persnickety since he\u02bcd left home: No crumbs on the counter, no dishes in the sink, clean sink basket.\n\nWe all said it\u02bcs different when it\u02bcs just you, you can keep things like you like them. You can put something down and know it\u02bcll be there when you go back. Actually, that\u02bcs not entirely true. If I take something out of a drawer and leave it out, when I come back, it\u02bcll be gone. Where are the scissors? Anet put them back in the drawer.\n\nBut people who live together for a while know what drives the other one nuts. They wash out the sink even if they might not have if they were living alone. They load the dishwasher with the plastic glasses on the top and the ceramic mugs on the bottom, and always wash sharp knives by hand.\n\nI\u02bcm the sink washer. I wash it several times a day, whenever I\u02bcm standing there, get the drips off the sides and bottom, dump the basket -- Carol stops me, puts in: \"There are beautiful chrome baskets you can get, I\u02bcve got one, do you know them?\" \"Yes, we do and we put them in all our listings, too,\" says Anet.\n\nI keep a magic eraser just under the sink, it\u02bcs the best, gets black marks off the porcelain made by washing metal pans in the sink.

But he didn't. Overshadowed by his Olympic team-mates, the outspoken sprinter says he is 'bitter' and 'distraught' - and explains why he will never return to the track\n\nOn their way home from Beijing, our Olympic heroes were rewarded with an upgrade from British Airways; anyone with a gold or silver medal would be allocated a Club World seat, while Chris Hoy, Rebecca Adlington and Bradley Wiggins would fly in first-class. One man who, in that case, would not be turning left on to the aeroplane was Mark Cavendish. Earlier in the summer, he had been the hottest property in road cycling, following two stage wins in the Giro d'Italia and four in the Tour de France. Now the 23-year-old from the Isle of Man was the only rider out of 14 on Great Britain's track cycling team not to win a medal in the Laoshan Velodrome.\n\nIf this was a crashing fall to earth, worse was to follow. Cavendish borrowed a medal from one of his team-mates only to be stopped at check-in by a stewardess with polite words to the effect of: 'My boyfriend follows cycling and I know you didn't win that.' In the event, he was given a seat in Club, but you do wonder what was going through the mind of the sprinter - not known as one of sport's most self-effacing characters - on the nine-hour flight.\n\nCavendish has had a phenomenal year. In March, he won gold in the Madison at the track world championships with Wiggins, someone whom he describes as 'like a brother'. At the Giro d'Italia in May - the first of the grand tours, the three competitions that define the road-cycling calendar - he won as many stages in one race as British riders had taken in the event's 99-year history. At the Tour de France in July, he proved, four times over, that he is the fastest man on two wheels. Cavendish may never wear the yellow jersey - as he admits, he cannot climb a hill - but again he far outstripped what any British cyclist had ever achieved in a single Tour. By the end of the season he had won 17 road races, making him the most successful professional rider in the world.\n\nAnd yet, almost overnight, Cavendish's achievements were overshadowed by the stunning domination of the track team in Beijing. Track and road cycling are very different disciplines - Cavendish is practically unique right now in being able to excel at both - but the British public seem to have room in their hearts (and memory banks) only for the Olympics. Do not expect the Manx rider to feature prominently on the BBC's Sports Personality of the Year show. 'With cycling, the guy on the street will know the Tour de France and the Olympics and nothing else,' says Chris Boardman, who won gold at Barcelona in 1992, before hitting the road and winning three prologue stages of the Tour. 'And for the Tour de France you have got to win it overall to match the Olympics. Naturally the Olympics is a bigger thing for your average Joe Punter.'\n\nSo Cavendish remains virtually unknown in Britain. Every so often, though, someone will come up to him in an airport or a restaurant, look at him with sad eyes, and say: 'Oh, hard luck at the Olympics.' He doesn't know quite how to respond.\n\nCavendish still lives in the Isle of Man, a wild but hospitable place that has outlawed birching and the death penalty only recently but where, he claims, 'you are still allowed to shoot a Scotsman in a kilt, as long as you do it with a bow and arrow'.\n\nWe have arranged to meet for a ride and, when I arrive on a wintry Monday morning at his house, he is in slippers in the kitchen attempting to stop his espresso machine from overheating. He would like to make it a short one this morning, which suits me just fine. 'I ride my bike 45,000km a year,' he says. 'People ask you to come here and there and I say, \"I can't.\" And they say, \"Yeah, I realise you're tired, I realise you just want a bit of peace and quiet.\" And it's like, no. I. Am. Fucked. I'm totally, utterly exhausted. My body is eating itself because I'm so tired.'\n\nThere is no such thing as an easy ride on the island; the roads swoop and pitch like a rollercoaster. The weather does not help: it is hard not to smile when Cavendish comes down changed, wearing ear, arm and leg warmers and neoprene booties, but it makes more sense when hail starts to spit viciously 45 minutes in. The Isle of Man is producing some of the best young cyclists in Britain at the moment - both Jonny Bellis and Peter Kennaugh are rated as future Tour riders - and you cannot help feeling, sucking for breath up another strength-sapping climb, that a variation of 'If you can make it here ... ' is at work.\n\nThere is a rumour that Cavendish might still be raw about the Olympics, but the subject comes up organically. We have stopped at the island's only cycling track in Onchan, which a few years ago was turned into a stock-car venue, but has since been abandoned. He says that he dreams one day of opening a proper indoor velodrome here, that it could be something for him to look after when he retires. What, I wonder, is his future on the track?\n\n'I'm finished,' he says coldly. 'No, there's nothing for me to do there now. I wouldn't gain anything in my career either financially or in terms of being remembered. It would just be a hindrance to what I can gain on the road.'\n\nWhat about 2012? 'Yeah, I'll be going to 2012, but I'll be going on the road.'\n\nHours later, in the shadow of an almighty flatscreen in his living room, he returns to the subject of the Olympics. Cavendish is of slighter build than you might expect, just 5ft 8in, and his hair is cropped so tight that you almost wouldn't know it was curly. His accent is softer, less Scouse than during his notoriously brash interviews on television, where he often talks with a certainty that might make Muhammad Ali blush. Anyone expecting his confidence to be dented by recent events, however, will be disappointed.\n\n'If the Olympics didn't happen,' he says, 'what I've done in cycling this year, if I don't mind saying so myself, is pretty fucking phenomenal. So the Olympics, I was doing it as a favour to British Cycling for helping me. Winning the Olympics will do fuck all for my cycling career. If I want to be a celebrity or go on breakfast TV, it would do a hell of a lot for my career. But it would do nothing for my cycling career.'\n\nSome explanation: Cavendish is employed for the most part by his road-cycling outfit, the American-backed Team Columbia. His success this year will make him one of the most highly paid riders in a sport where even journeymen can earn close to \u00a3100,000 a year. Many Olympic champions, despite those appearances on GMTV and meeting the Queen, will earn a fraction of this, as Bradley Wiggins discovered after winning gold in 2004. 'Round where we lived,' he said recently, 'people would say to my wife, \"What are you doing here? Brad's a millionaire now.\" I had the same misconception. The reality was quite different. I woke up every Monday morning and we were still overdrawn and I'd think, \"God, I don't feel like riding my bike today.\"'\n\n'The biggest regret of my career is quitting the Tour de France,' Cavendish continues, looking back on his decision to leave this year's race after stage 14 so that he would be fresh for the Olympics. 'I feel massively let down, I'm still bitter now. To leave the Tour de France to do that. You sit there, sit there, you're the last event on, every single member of the team has got a medal, the pressure's on you and, boom, it goes. You don't get it, even though I still think I was the best rider on the track. It's quite hard to accept really.'\n\nThe Madison, named after Madison Square Garden in New York, where it was popularised at the turn of the last century, is so complicated that you sometimes wonder if anyone really knows the rules. One thing in Beijing was certain: Wiggins, one of the greatest track riders ever, and Cavendish, with his untouchable finishing, were as close as you could get to a dream team going into the 50km, 200-lap race. That, however, was before Wiggins went through six races, all in world-class times, to win golds in the 4,000m individual pursuit and team pursuit. As he admits in his autobiography, 'Physically, I was in bits,' and, despite a pre-race blast of 'Oasis and Weller', the pair could only finish ninth. Although they are close friends, they did not speak for more than two months after the event.\n\n'At first after the Olympics, I was pissed at Brad,' Cavendish admits. 'But if he's made to train for 4k, for sure he's not going to be good at 50k. And they [British Cycling] were all about the team pursuit and he just had to train at 4k. In training, they would just ignore me while they timed the team pursuiters going round. They trained so much for that that they forgot the Madison - well, they didn't forget the Madison, they didn't give a shit.\n\n'That's not fair when I've given that much commitment to it. I left the Tour de France - the biggest bike race in the world - when I was fighting for the green jersey [awarded to the best sprinter in the race] and I could have potentially won on the Champs Elys\u00e9es, and it makes me bitter that they didn't give back what I'd given to them.'\n\nChris Boardman, now head of research and development at British Cycling, unsurprisingly, has a different version of events. 'Mark's goal for the year had to be the Tour de France and that meant that we had to take whatever was left,' he says. 'Afterwards, he had to take a break for a week when the other guys were on a training camp. Then he wanted to capitalise on it and ride some Criteriums' - short races on street circuits - 'around the world and then he just wanted to do some training on his own in Manchester. And all this time the other guys were on an Olympic camp, doing specific preparation for the Games. So I don't think that helped massively.'\n\nDespite this, even Boardman admits that Cavendish was in good shape in Beijing. 'Yes, it was mostly Bradley. It was a gamble that didn't work out.'\n\nBefore the Games, it was speculated that Cavendish might also compete in the individual pursuit in Beijing, the event that Wiggins has dominated in recent years. Cavendish would never have seriously challenged his friend, but he rode a trial in Manchester to see if he should take the second spot in the team. Ultimately, it was decided that entering the event - which he had raced on only a handful of occasions - would be too much of a risk. This is now another regret for Cavendish. 'My time would have got a decent result,' he says wistfully.\n\nIn the final, New Zealand's Hayden Roulston took silver with 4 minutes 19.6 seconds - it is been rumoured that Cavendish was riding under 4 mins 20 secs. Were his times good enough to win a medal? 'Possibly.'\n\nSay what you like about Mark Cavendish, but you are always guaranteed a forthright opinion. This has not always endeared him to fellow competitors - the Italian rider Filippo Pozzato has called him 'disrespectful' and his cycling 'reckless' - or to some of the sport's fans, who make vicious attacks on him on internet forums. For many, it seems, an enduring image of the summer was Cavendish approaching the finish line, rocked back on saddle, his rivals burned off, wearing an expression that one blogger describes as 'very punchable'.\n\n'You must have seen him interviewed after events and he can be really good or he can be absolutely appalling and offensive,' Boardman says. 'He just doesn't think about it. If he's won, he's happy to talk and he's chatty; but catch him across the line when he's lost and ask him \"How does that feel?\" and he just looks at the person like \"Are you thick? Well, I lost.\" He comes across as a right dick sometimes, but it's because you have caught somebody who is in a totally emotional state. And that's where he has to be to do the job.'\n\nBefore this year's Tour de France, Wiggins was asked for his predictions by ITV: 'I think Cav will win a couple of stages and then his head will get so big that it won't fit in the door when he comes back,' he said half-jokingly. I ask him about that comment now. 'Actually, I see a lot of myself in him when I was that age,' Wiggins says diplomatically. 'But he's not as cocky as he portrays on the telly, he's a nice bloke really. He does play to the television and press a bit. He tells me that he's said things and he says, \"Should I have said that?\" And I'll say, \"Man, it's done now.\" But he's had such a rapid rise to fame and it's difficult to know how to handle it.'\n\nCavendish is certainly less intense than he sometimes comes across as and is an unguarded, refreshing antidote to many modern sport stars. In his mind, he is not arrogant or boastful, he is merely confirming what any overhead TV camera shows: he is the fastest man in the world in the last 200m of a bike race. 'Why finish a race and say something that you've read off a bit of paper? It's stupid,' he says. 'That takes the passion out of sport. When you start a sport, you do it because you love it, you do it because it means everything to you. So you want to say your feelings and if you let your emotions pour out it shows how much the sport means to you. And cycling means everything to me.'\n\nCavendish has always ridden BMXs, but he took up cycling seriously when he was 13. Despite an unpromising physique - most cyclists have long limbs that work like levers; his legs are squat and muscular and push the pedals like pistons - he always finished races like a bull. Mostly, however, what marked him out from others was hard work. His brother Andrew, one year younger, started cycling around the same time and everyone agrees that he probably had more innate talent. Yet it was Mark who would go out on the bike for two hours after school or cycle throughout the seemingly permanent Isle of Man winters.\n\nFrom the age of 14, Mark was going to races on the mainland, often on his own. He recalls one occasion where he was racing in Manchester and he caught the midnight ferry carrying his track bike over one shoulder and dragging his road bike in a bag, as well as lugging a rucksack with his kit in. He arrived in Heysham in the morning, took the train to Manchester, ate a pasta salad from Asda and then waited around until his race in the afternoon. He then made the return journey home, arriving after midnight. Was that the difference between him and Andrew, who by this stage had stopped riding? 'I think so, yeah,' he replies. 'But I think that's the difference between me and a hell of a lot of people. Everyone really.'\n\nAt that age, cycling was still competing in his life with ballroom dancing; this sounds like a joke or at least a quirky British movie, but Mark's mother runs a dancewear store in Douglas, while his father is an IT consultant for accountancy firms. Mark was far from a natural dancer, and his new hobby did not go uncommented upon at school, but perversely this seemed to make him keener than ever to succeed. 'Again, Andrew got out of it pretty soon because of peer pressure, whereas Mark was determined he was going to win something,' says his father David. 'He would be: \"I hate this but I'm damn well going to win something.\"' In the end, he became half of the best pair on the island and competed at the national championships, specialising in Latin American.\n\nIt also revealed another more belligerent side to his character. 'When he was dancing, they do the team dances when they have got six or eight pairs or something like that and he's the one who's telling everyone else they're out of step,' his father continues. 'Him and his partner are the only ones who are doing it right and five or seven others are doing it wrong.'\n\nCavendish, however, never doubted he would make it as a pro cyclist. He studied French and German at GCSE, so he would be better equipped to ride with continental teams, and, despite good exam results, he left school at 16 to work in a bank to save money to get his professional licence. The bank was a formative experience - he hardly cycled for 18 months and on a diet of 'cream cakes and sausage baps' his weight ballooned to almost 13 stone. But it also made him more determined than ever. 'The best thing that happened to me is working in that bank, because now I realise that I could be doing that,' he says. 'I'd rather be on my bike in the rain than sat in the bank serving customers with it raining outside.'\n\nEveryone agrees that road sprinters are a rare, unreconstructed breed. Watched in real time, the end of a race looks like swirling chaos, with 200 riders lunging dementedly towards the line at up to 50mph, their elbows jutting out and their wheels weaving across the road. A fractional misjudgment by one rider could result in the entire mass bundling into a pile. At the front, there is butting, pushing, sledging and, on one famous occasion, bottle throwing. It takes very little to sabotage one of your rivals at this speed - what is known as 'flicking' from the German word 'ficken', meaning 'to fuck'.\n\n'A lot of sprinters are quite emotional,' Chris Boardman says. 'You have to be - it's like being a fighter, you have got to be really up for it. Whereas I might be in the middle of a peloton and there are 100 people in front of me and I see all these bodies, Mark will see the gaps between the bodies. That's a fundamental difference between us.'\n\nI ask Cavendish's fianc\u00e9e, Melissa, if she is scared for him in the final stages of a race. 'It's not fear of him crashing,' she answers, 'it's fear of him not winning,' and it is immediately clear why they have been a couple for eight years, since Mark was 15. (They are due to be married in October, though only, Cavendish says straight-faced, with Melissa purposely in earshot, if 'I don't go off with that Diana from X Factor'.)\n\nSprints, it is usually assumed, are something of a lottery, particularly in a race such as the Tour de France, which brings together the fastest, most determined bike riders in the world. So many factors need to be in place, not least that you need to summon an unholy amount of power - something like 1,600 watts, 50 per cent more than a good club rider could produce on fresh legs - after cycling for six hours every day for three weeks. Besides that, you need a strong team to put you in a position to contest the final burst and luck to stay out of trouble. While his team is one of the best, Cavendish's greatest achievement is in making something that should be unpredictable into a routine occurrence. At this year's Tour it did not matter if it was sunny or rainy, if the finish was uphill or downhill, he would leave his rivals banging their handlebars in fury.\n\nIt is not immediately obvious why Cavendish is able to dominate road sprints so emphatically. Physically, he is powerful but not superhuman; he is strong, yet he never lifts weights or does anything in fact but ride his bike. 'Mark's a bit of a freak,' says Dr David Bailey, a physiologist with the English Institute of Sport, who is responsible for monitoring British Cycling's endurance athletes, including Cavendish and Wiggins. 'He doesn't fit a physiological characteristic that you would say that's why he's good, that's why he's different. I think the fact that he is small certainly has aerodynamic benefits and he has a muscle mass that enables him to generate that power but it isn't at the cost of being a barn door going into the wind. Maybe that's it.'\n\nOther factors are undoubtedly his age and his track background - as sprinters get older, their bodies adapt to the demands of three-week endurance races and lose some of their natural speed. There's also, this being cycling, the issue of doping. With the sport arguably cleaner than ever before, Cavendish - who has always submitted to the most scrupulous testing - is competing on the most level playing field for many years.\n\nWhen those who know him are asked to explain his success, however, a consensus does start to emerge. 'Without a doubt, it's his mind, he's so strong in the mind,' says Rod Ellingworth, who has coached Cavendish since he was 18. For his father, 'it's his determination'. While for Boardman, it is 'self-belief'.\n\nBoardman continues: 'It sounds a throwaway line, but for a sprinter it's critical. Because if you are physically having a fight with somebody and you believe you are going to win, you are protected by the hormone surge you get as a reward for that. Everything is driving towards winning. Whereas if you have the slightest doubt, you think, \"I'm going to lose,\" your body starts thinking of alternatives, how to get away from this, it shuts things down, you start to feel the pain. Mark simply believes he is going to win, so all the adrenaline and everything else he needs to put himself in a position to win happens.'\n\nIt seems counter-intuitive that, in a sport dominated by athletes whose greatness is often measured in abstract values such as aerobic capacity and resting heart rate, an individual can get to the top through mental strength. But, despite Cavendish's other qualities as a rider, that seems to be the case. 'I think he played cycling a hell of a lot in his head as a kid,' Ellingworth says. 'He dreamed cycling, he dreamed moments, he dreamed situations, he saw himself racing. When he was a young kid he would be out, I don't know, doing his paper round or just a club run, but he was riding the Tour de France or Paris-Roubaix. If you spoke to people who worked with people's minds, they would say it's visualisation, but Mark has just always done it instinctively.'\n\nIf you listen to Cavendish, it is frightening what he can achieve in the next few seasons. The route for the 2009 Tour has already been announced and the profile of the course looks to suit him even better than last year. The record of eight stage wins is an outside shot, but he will be determined to complete the race and he has set his sights on the maillot vert, the second most prestigious jersey. Beyond that, Cavendish is already counting the days to the 2011 Road Cycling World Championships, which will be held on a pan-flat course in Copenhagen.\n\nHe nods when asked if he is adamant that he will not return to the track. 'The track for me is easy success and for other people it's easy success, which is real nice,' he says. 'It's nice to indulge and get easy success, you are not going to turn it down. But yeah, after a while, if it's easy and it keeps coming, do something different.' Is this an implicit criticism of track specialists such as Wiggins and Hoy? 'Absolutely not. They are amazing, amazing athletes. What Brad does in the individual pursuit is the equivalent of what road riders do, it shows what is physically possible. Every nation in the world does road cycling, but on the track, if you took Great Britain out, it is not so strong.'\n\nBoardman broadly agrees with this point and his words put Cavendish's prolific success in context. 'What you have on the road is tremendous strength in depth and the difference between the best and virtually all of the also-rans is frighteningly subtle,' he says. 'In the track world, the level of competition is just as high, but for two or three people and then the drop-off is quite big. So there just isn't the strength in depth. And it's more controllable on the track. You can work hard for something and prepare properly, taper down and be ready for the day and you will get a reward. On the road, you can be in awesome shape and it just doesn't go your way and you don't get a look in.'\n\nIt is clear that Cavendish is an emotional character and even now he remains 'really distraught' about the Olympics; the days after were the first time he can ever remember not wanting to ride his bike. You just hope that he does not come to regret some of his more finite pronouncements. Both Ellingworth and Boardman have spoken to him about this side of his personality, but both men agree that his ability to channel this passion is a major factor in what makes him an exceptional competitor. The danger, when you live somewhere such as the Isle of Man, is that it is easy to become isolated and, as Boardman observes, as you become more successful, 'people talk more quietly and you do less listening'.\n\nCavendish seems genuinely touched to win OSM's award; it provides, he says, some acknowledgement for what he has achieved this year. When we leave him it is dark outside and he is standing in his kitchen, back in his slippers, eating a bowl of cereal. He has a beautiful house in the hills, a Lexus in the driveway, a lovely fianc\u00e9e and a shaggy labrador called Amber. He is young, outrageously talented and hugely respected. He is a decent guy and admirably unaffected, even if he does have a big mouth. Hell, he may even be legally allowed to take down a Scotsman if he oversteps the mark. The only thing that feels like it is lacking from his life is recognition from the British public; winning that, however, might just make cycling up l'Alpe D'Huez look easy.\n\nHoy, Cavendish and Wiggins: who's got the power?\n\nEverything in cycling comes down to the watts that a rider generates with every turn of their wheels. Watts provide the most accurate gauge of how hard you are working; heart rate fluctuates and so does speed. The intensity of effort needed to climb a hill remains the same no matter how fast you ride.\n\n'If you put Chris Hoy in the position that Mark Cavendish is in at the end of a race, Chris would beat him every time,' says Dr David Bailey, a physiologist for British Cycling. 'But if you asked Chris to cycle for four hours beforehand there is no way he would be there. Bradley Wiggins, if you put him in Mark's position at the end of a race, hasn't got the explosive power. Mark's ability is that he is in the middle of the two; he has a peak power higher than Brad's but he has a capacity that is much higher than Chris's.'\n\nBailey suggests, with a smile, that I take a power test to compare an average cyclist to Tour riders. Like many people who have come to cycling relatively late (in my case, my mid-twenties), I retain a deluded belief that if only I had discovered the sport earlier, I could have been a contender. I have not cycled seriously for a few years, but I still ride to work most days, slipstreaming commuters, not satisfied until I have broken the 50-year-old man on a Brompton who is oblivious to the race he has not entered.\n\nI start turning the pedals on a stationary bike in Bailey's lab. I wear a heart-rate monitor and Bailey and an assistant sit in front of me staring at laptops, which process data from a \u00a33,000 cycle computer that is attached to the bike. First up is a sprint test - at a light resistance, from a standing start, I just have to spin the pedals as fast as I can for six seconds.\n\nNext is the ramp test, which measures the wattage you can produce over a sustained period, ideally eight-to-12 minutes. Resistance is set initially by the testers and increases by five watts every 15 seconds until you are no longer able to turn the pedals (or until the cadence of your pedalling drops below a predefined measure).\n\nNow, this test is a little Guant\u00e1namo Bay for my liking. After two minutes, sweat starts to course in rivulets off my body; after five minutes, I begin to taste the sandwich I have eaten for lunch; at nine minutes 47 seconds Bailey's assistant steps in to end the misery.\n\nSo, how did I do? 'It's probably not what you wanted to hear,' says Bailey with a kind look, pointing to numbers on a print-out, 'but your values here would fall in to around the Women's Academy.' He's absolutely right; I wanted to find out that I was being fast-tracked on to the Talent ID programme for 2012, but never mind.\n\nIt emerges that my maximum power output is 1,000w, which is about 40 per cent of Chris Hoy's. Cavendish will generate around 1,600w at the end of a six-hour stage race, which helps to explain why no one can touch him. The wattage that I finish the ramp test on is, apparently, lower than the level at which Bradley Wiggins will start his. The highest value, which I hold for just a minute, is around 75 per cent of what a decent pro cyclist would hold throughout the course of a day. It is a chastening experience.\n\nThe tests do, however, provide a surprising shared bond with Cavendish. 'Body-wise, if you look at numbers, apart from the sprint test, I'm really, really pathetic,' he says. 'The year I was world champion for the first time [2005], I wouldn't have qualified for the under-16 programme on the lab tests.'","1103":"Spring recipe: Martha Stewart's Easter Chick Cookies By Jessica Yadegaran | jyadegaran@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group\n\nYour Easter baskets or dessert table will look super festive with these darling chicks and eggs from \"Martha Stewart's Cookie Perfection\" (Clarkson Potter; $26). The iced lemon shortbread cookies are simply decorated with sanding sugar, sprinkles, mini chocolate chips and candy -- easy for helpers with little hands.\n\nDecorations: Yellow fine sanding sugar, jumbo candy sequins, orange and yellow sprinkles, candy hearts, and mini chocolate chips, for decorating\n\nDirections\n\nMake the cookies: In a small bowl, whisk together flour and salt. In a large bowl, using an electric mixer on medium-high, beat butter until fluffy, 3 to 5 minutes. Add \u00bd cup powdered sugar, and continue to beat until pale and fluffy, occasionally scraping down sides of bowl, about 2 minutes more. Beat in vanilla. Gradually add flour mixture, and mix on low, scraping sides if necessary, until flour is just incorporated and dough sticks together when squeezed with fingers.\n\nShape dough into 2 disks and wrap each in plastic. Refrigerate until firm, at least 1 hour.\n\nHeat oven to 325 degrees. Roll out one disk to \u00bc-inch thickness. Cut out shapes using a 2\u00bd-inch tall egg cookie cutter. (To create an egg shape, pinch one end of a 2\u00bd-inch oval cookie cutter.) Transfer cookies to parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing them about 1 inch apart. Repeat with remaining disk. Reroll scraps and repeat.\n\nBake until firm and golden, 13 to 15 minutes. For flatter cookies, tap sheets on counter halfway through baking and again afterward. Let cool completely on wire racks.\n\nMake the icing: Stir together the 3 cups powdered sugar and lemon juice. Tint with food coloring. Transfer icing to a pastry bag fitted with a small round tip (such as Ateco #1 or #2). Flood cookies with icing.\n\nFor the chicks: Dip an iced cookie in sanding sugar; let dry. Dot candy sequins with icing; overlap to create feathers. Use orange sprinkles for feet, a candy heart for a beak, and upside-down mini chocolate chips for eyes.\n\nFor the eggs: Lay orange or yellow sprinkles in a zigzag pattern halfway up an iced cookie. Sprinkle bottom with sanding sugar. (Cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature up to 5 days.)","1104":"Squalene and cholesterol in the balance at the ER membrane This article requires a subscription to view the full text. If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nTargeting the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway has become a mainstay for the treatment of ischemic heart disease (1). However, the importance of cholesterol metabolism is not just confined to atherosclerosis, as cholesterol is an essential component of membranes, a precursor for other metabolic pathways, and can fuel tumor growth (2). Understanding how the cholesterol synthetic pathway is regulated is therefore of broad biological interest. Cellular cholesterol abundance is tightly regulated through a combination of uptake through low-density lipoprotein receptors and synthesis, with cholesterol sensing occurring at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (3, 4). Cholesterol is detected by ER-resident proteins with sterol-sensing domains, which both govern the stability of cholesterol synthetic enzymes and control the release of the SREBP2 transcription factor, regulating the transcription of genes required for cholesterol synthesis and uptake (4). This process is classically exemplified by the sterol-sensitive degradation of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), a rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis, and the target of statins (1) (Fig. 1). In PNAS, Yoshioka et al. (5) present findings relating to squalene monooxygenase (SM, also known as squalene epoxidase, SQLE), a further rate-limiting step in the cholesterol synthetic pathway, identifying a previously unappreciated role for squalene in regulating SM stability (Fig. 1).","1105":"Sri Lanka vs West Indies: Andre Russell Powers West Indies To Series Win Over Sri Lanka | Cricket News Andre Russell hit six sixes in a blistering 14-ball innings as West Indies smashed their way to a seven-wicket victory over Sri Lanka and seal the two-match T20I series on Friday.

By nightfall, sorrow would shadow the day.\n\nTeresi was 16, a junior at Henry High School. About 7 a.m., he dropped off his 21-year-old brother, John, for a final exam at the University of Minnesota's Nicholson Hall. John and his best friend were then heading to Miami for spring break. That meant the little brother could drive the big brother's 1957 Ford Fairlane, with its stylishly tapered fins, to high school.\n\nKaplan was almost 11, heading to Mexico for a family vacation. At 12:50 p.m. at Minneapolis' Wold-Chamberlain Airport, Kaplan's family was among 69 passengers and six Minnesota-based crew members boarding Northwest Airlines Flight 710 -- a Lockheed Electra bound for Chicago's Midway Airport.\n\nThat last exam complete, John also climbed into the plane along with 30-year-old figure skater Martha (Marty) Chalfen and her three kids -- Debbie (7), Linda (5) and Morris Dickie (2). Their dad, Morris Chalfen, had co-founded the Minneapolis Lakers basketball team and ran the widely popular Holiday on Ice skating shows, which put him in Paris on that St. Patrick's Day 60 years ago this week. Morris Chalfen would never again step inside his family's house on Lake of the Isles. It was too heartbreaking.\n\nFlight 710 landed in Chicago about 2 p.m. Kaplan, his parents and 5-year-old sister Alice joined 47 deplaning passengers.\n\n\"Alice and Linda Chalfen were classmates at Northrop Collegiate School and probably played on the first flight,\" said Kaplan, now 70, who switched planes and flew off to Mexico City.\n\nAbout 3:15 p.m., 18,000 feet over southern Indiana, witnesses saw smoke, heard two explosions and watched as a wing and engine fell from the four-engine propeller plane. Arcing with one engine on the stub of its left wing, the fuselage plowed into a remote soybean field at 600 mph near the Indiana-Kentucky border -- killing all 63 aboard and leaving a huge, ghastly crater.\n\nThe Kaplan family learned what happened the next day at a Mexican newsstand.\n\n\"I was more nonplussed than you'd think. As a kid, you're like: 'Wow, that was lucky.' It gave me something to tell my friends back at Blake,\" said Mark Kaplan, who would grow up to serve on the Minneapolis City Council. \"I have no memories of being hit by a big shot of adrenaline like I would had I been an adult. It didn't faze me for decades until it dawned on me just how I'd dodged a bullet.\"\n\nTom Teresi had driven his brother's Ford to Henry High School and then went to work as a Western Union messenger downtown before heading to his family's home at 3731 N. Upton Av. in Minneapolis.\n\n\"I got home at 6:30 that night and everyone was gathered around the TV, crying in shock and disbelief,\" said Teresi, now 76. \"My brother was so happy, so destined for good things. John was five years older than me, the captain of the hockey and baseball teams at Henry and -- darn it -- he was better looking than me.\"\n\nWith neither a body to bury nor a mortuary, Tom said mourners flooded his family's home. He remembers how John's girlfriend sat in a chair, crying.\n\n\"They'd met at Welcome Week at the U and had been together for more than three years -- she was at such a tender age of 21,\" he said, asking that we not use her name because she never divulged her first love to her eventual husband and kids.\n\nTen years ago, when Tom visited the crash site memorial near Tell City, Ind., for the 50th anniversary, a story appeared in the St. Paul Pioneer Press.\n\nSoon afterward, John's girlfriend rang him up from the lobby of Tom's senior building in New Brighton. He'd lost track of her as a teenager nearly 50 years earlier, but she'd seen the story. They've since gotten together a few times. She's now a widow with three children. Tom is married with four kids.\n\n\"I only have four or five photos of my brother so I asked her if she had any,\" he said. \"She said she did, but after 49 years, she decided to destroy them.\"\n\nTom, his parents and sister attended a memorial service at the crash site back in 1960, but his folks refused to fly. So Northwest picked up the tab for first-class train fare. A design flaw in the wing, it was later determined, brought down Flight 710 -- the third deadly Electra crash in fewer than 13 months.\n\nDuring the grisly recovery of remains, Indiana searchers located John Teresi's intact billfold. His brother keeps it in a storage closet across the hall from his apartment with his few photos and John's red-and-gray Henry High letter sweater.\n\nCurt Brown's tales about Minnesota's history appear each Sunday.

And now, through a series of novels, young adult books, junior novels, and comics we're going to explore it for the first time. There is no single main protagonist in The High Republic, but rather a whole cast of characters who will pop up in the various stories. These five are only some of the new faces we'll be meeting for the first time.\n\nThough this is a time of relative peace before the Galactic Civil War that ignited during the Prequels, that doesn't mean there aren't dangers. The villainous Nihil are space vikings who pose a threat to the entire galaxy thanks to their unique ability to disrupt hyperspace travel. These are the Jedi Knights and Masters who will stand against them in the High Republic era.\n\n\"Readers will see a very wide variety of Jedi in this era,\" said Lucasfilm Publishing creative director Michael Siglain on StarWars.com. \"This is a hopeful, optimistic time, when the Jedi are good and noble, and we want to reflect that in their characters while still giving them enough depth and dimension so that their individual personalities and idiosyncrasies shine through. The Jedi Knights of the High Republic are both aspirational and inspirational. In short, they're the good guys.\"\n\nThough the Jedi are mighty, all of these news characters were crafted to be flawed and \"human\" just like anyone else.\n\n\"We've put a lot of time and effort into making our Jedi feel like real, rounded individuals,\" explained Cavan Scott, writer of the Star Wars: The High Republic comic series for Marvel Comics. \"They are all different, approaching the Force in individual and unique ways and yet are united with a common goal. They serve not out of unwavering dogma, but a deep passion to protect light and life. And they're all at different stages in their individual journeys. Some have experience on their side, some have the exuberance of youth. Some are still finding their place in the Order while others step naturally into leadership roles. Some may not have chosen to work with the Jedi they've been posted alongside, but all are dedicated to be a guiding light for the galaxy. Individually they are strong, together they are invincible, but like the best heroes they each have lessons to learn and challenges to overcome. Exciting times lie ahead.\"\n\nWith that in mind, let's meet these new Jedi.\n\nYou can check out the new Jedi by flipping through the slideshow below or keep scrolling for the article.\n\nAvar Kriss wields a green lightsaber and is described as the brightest and most noble example of what it means to be a Jedi. If there were a Captain America among these new Jedi, she'd be it. She's optimistic, self-sacrificing, and an inspiration to those around her. She goes by her sense of compassion rather than the dogma of the Jedi. She's enthusiastic about living on the frontier of unexplored space and the new adventures it brings. (That's right, the galaxy isn't as well-explored during this time, so locations familiar to fans might not have been discovered yet.) She is literally described as \"the best of the best.\" And it looks like the Nihil are about to put that to the test.\n\nWhere to Find Her: Star Wars: The High Republic - Light of the Jedi novel by Charles Soule\n\nLoden Greatstorm may have a glum look on his face but don't let that fool you, he's described as having a good sense of humor. This Twi-lek Jedi Master uses a beautiful yellow blade and is renowned as one of the best teachers in the Jedi Order who is always looking for ways to improve himself and the Padawans under his tutelage. Think of him as Yoda, but taller!\n\nWhere to Find Him: Star Wars: The High Republic - Light of the Jedi novel by Charles Soule\n\nKeeve Trennis is the new kid on the block and comes armed with a green double-bladed lightsaber. Only a Jedi Knight for a matter of weeks, she's described as a quick-witted and impulsive with a promising future, if only she can trust in herself as much as she trusts in the Force. Keeve finds herself starstruck working alongside living legends like Avar Kriss and wants nothing more than to prove herself. To keep the Marvel metaphor going, she sounds a lot like Peter Parker when he first met his idol Tony Stark. She's stationed on the Starlight Beacon, a space station that acts as a galactic hub and a main setting in the High Republic era, and she's immediately tossed into the deep end when the Nihil bring about the Great Disaster -- a catastrophic, inciting event that throws the galaxy into chaos.\n\nWhere to Find Her: Star Wars: The High Republic comic by Cavan Scott\n\nSpeaking of all these new lightsabers, check out our video breaking down why they look a little different than you might expect:\n\nStellan Gios is not unlike Avar Kriss in that he's a Jedi Master described as optimistic and well-respected. Stellan and Avar came up through the Jedi Order together, and while they don't always wind up on the same assignment, when they do pair together they make one heck of a powerhouse team. But it sounds like we might have to wait to see the duo in action together, as the description on StarWars.com says Stellan is currently stationed at a Jedi Temple on the distant planet of Caragon-Viner. We hope that's at least a place where he can put that cool Excalibur-esque, metal crossguard lightsaber to good use.\n\nVernestra \"Vern\" Rwoh was Padawan to Stellan Gios but is now a freshly minted Jedi Knight. In fact, at age 16 she's one of the youngest Knights in a generation. She's described as someone who works harder than most people her age, and she struggles to fit in with adults while also trying to be a role model for younger Jedi. So pretty much Hermione Granger with a violet lightsaber.\n\nWhere to Find Her: Star Wars: The High Republic - A Test of Courage junior novel by Justina Ireland","1111":"Startup of the year 2014: Superfood Market Online Name: Superfood Market Online\n\nBased: Bradford\n\nWebsite: www.superfood-market.com\n\nWe made friends with 5,000 independent brands and brought them together in one place for the first time ever.\n\nWe have built the business from initial idea to \u00a3500,000 turnover, become VAT registered, taken on apprentices, and now trade in 12 countries.\n\nGemma Price is the director of Superfood Market Online","1112":"State courts temporarily eliminate bail for low-level offenses as part of COVID-19 response By Robert Salonga | rsalonga@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group\n\nThe judicial body overseeing California's state courts has invoked emergency powers to temporarily eliminate bail for people arrested and charged with low-level offenses, as part of a continuing effort to slow the influx of inmates and chances of a COVID-19 outbreak at county jails.\n\nThe Judicial Council, headed by Chief Justice Tani Cantil-Sakauye, on Monday unanimously approved setting bail to $0 for misdemeanors and most nonviolent felonies, and specified that the new condition also apply to those being held on bail on such charges.\n\nThe new bail standard will go into effect April 13, and will be in effect for 90 days after the end of the state of emergency declared by Gov. Gavin Newsom, the council decided during a conference call. It was Newsom who granted the Judicial Council emergency powers to keep the state's courts in operation through the pandemic.\n\nMarsha Slough, a judicial council member and associate justice in the Fourth District Court of Appeal in Riverside who formally proposed the bail item, said it was part of a host of measures to strike \"a balance between the health and safety and the rights of defendants, and the courts, and the court workload.\"\n\nSlough also said that bails were being set to $0 to avoid confusion with \"no bail\" status, a common court term associated with serious offenses ineligible for bail.\n\nSanta Clara County Public Defender Molly O'Neal called the decision \"absolutely the right thing to do.\" She said it was an essential countermeasure to the council's March 28 decision to temporarily lengthen arraignment and speedy trial deadlines -- and 60-day extensions for jury trials -- that critics said risked keeping defendants in jail far longer than they needed to be.\n\n\"During these extraordinary times, we cannot unilaterally take away constitutional rights without a parallel acknowledgement that those awaiting adjudication of their criminal cases should not sit in jail with no end in sight,\" O'Neal said Monday.\n\nThe new bail rule was met with a modicum of caution from police officers. Ben Theriault, president of the Richmond Police Officers' Association, said he hoped the judges will be watchful of instances where the temporarily leniency could be exploited.\n\n\"Law enforcement appreciates and welcomes the need to reduce incarceration and flatten the curve during the COVID-19 epidemic,\" Theriault said in a statement to this news organization. \"However, we hope the judiciary uses its discretion (to ensure the safety of the public) if repeat offenders take advantage of the emergency rule ... . After all, judges have the power to alter bail as they see fit to each situation. The bail schedule is simply a guideline.\"\n\nAs with many of the council's other emergency measures, including vastly expanding allowable remote court hearings and proceedings, including court appearances and arraignments, individual counties had already taken to implementing their own practices responsive to statewide court closures and reductions.\n\nAlameda County Public Defender Brendon Woods noted Monday that his county's Superior Court had last week set bail to $0 for misdemeanors and felonies with a maximum of four years or less time to be served in prison, with some exceptions. One area where the Judicial Council was more stringent was setting bail to $0 for violations of misdemeanor probation.\n\n\"I think the bail schedule is definitely a step in the right direction statewide because this can eliminate people coming into the jails throughout the state for low-level offenses,\" Woods said.\n\nWoods, like many of his public defender peers along with inmate advocates, has pushed for early release for people already in the jail, saying once someone is infected with COVID-19, it \"spreads like wildfire.\"\n\nSince the beginning of March, Bay Area counties have worked to reduce jail populations by releasing hundreds of inmates, mostly pretrial detainees charged with nonviolent crimes and people in the last weeks of jail sentences. Surrender dates for those scheduled to start jail sentences have been postponed, and the jails themselves have prioritized violent crimes for booking.\n\n\"People didn't sign up and take a plea bargain, thinking it could result in a potential death sentence,\" Woods said.","1113":"State: Girl, 14, raped by staffer at mental health facility for troubled teens Investigators say staffer at Nexus Glen Lake assaulted emotionally troubled girl.\n\nA staff member at a state-licensed treatment facility for troubled teenage girls in Minnetonka flirted with a 14-year-old resident before raping the emotionally vulnerable teen, investigators revealed Tuesday.\n\nThe attack occurred on Dec. 22 at Nexus Glen Lake, a locked mental health facility located about a mile west of Interstate 494 and County Road 62, according to the state Department of Human Services (DHS).\n\nThe molestation and anal rape occurred in the resident's bedroom, the DHS's maltreatment report cited the teen as reporting to three Glen Lake employees.\n\nThe teen has a history of being sexually, physically and emotionally abused, and has suffered from depression and anxiety, the state investigators noted in their report.\n\nThe staffer denied the allegations and said the teen would make \"playful\" sexual comments to him, the DHS report read.\n\nA sexual assault exam and the DNA evidence collected neither confirmed nor discounted that the assault occurred, the DHS report read. The staffer, who identity was not disclosed by DHS, no longer works at the facility.\n\nThe Hennepin County Sheriff's Office has responsibility for any criminal investigation. A spokesman for the county attorney said he sees no evidence that a case was submitted by the Sheriff's Office for consideration of charges. A Sheriff's Office spokesman had no information to share about the case, including whether there was an investigation.\n\nWhile investigators placed the blame for the assault solely on the staff member, the DHS found in a follow-up investigation that Glen Lake committed background check violations involving other two employees and fined the facility $400.\n\nAccording to the DHS's findings, the staffer had a habit of saying he \"liked\" the teen and would slap her buttocks.\n\nOn the day of the assault, the two spent much of the staffer's shift \"interacting with one another,\" according the DHS review of the facility's surveillance video. The two were spotted together in a supply room with the lights off and were smiling after exiting. Later in the kitchen, the girl pressed her body against the staff member, without him appearing to object. The rape occurred less than an hour later.\n\nAlthough the staff member \"denied the allegations, given the consistent information provided by the [resident] and that video surveillance corroberated parts of [her] statement, it was determined that the [resident's] statements were more credible\" than the staffer's,\" the DHS report's conclusion read. \"Therefore, there was a preponderance ... of evidence that the [staff member] has sexual contact with [the teen] at the facility.\"\n\nThe 12-bed Glen Lake facility serves girls ages 14 to 19 with severe emotional and behavioral problems and is operated by the Plymouth-based nonprofit Nexus, one of the largest child residential treatment and foster care providers in the state.\n\nThe nonprofit has similar facilities in Minnesota in Onamia and Austin, two in Illinois and one in Baltimore. Nexus also provides foster care, adoption and in-home counseling services in Minnesota for children from birth to age 18.\n\nIn a statement read to the Star Tribune by one of its executives, Nexus said that as soon as staff became aware of the incident, \"the employee was removed from the area immediately and had no further contact with the alleged victim. The employee was terminated.\"\n\nThe girl was taken to a hospital emergency room, where staff there contacted law enforcement, the statement continued.\n\nThe state investigation found that a background check was done on this employee and that it \"found no fault with Nexus\" in connection with this incident, according to the statement.\n\nDHS records online show one other investigation of Glen Lake by the agency since 2010. That involved involved two allegations of physical abuse. Both claims were unsubstantiated.","1114":"Steinbach recalls the quake, 25 years later Terry Steinbach won one World Series during his 14-year major-league playing career, and while that remains the pinnacle of his ball-playing days, he admits that the circumstances of that championship leave him with conflicting feelings about it.\n\n\"The best way for me to describe it is, it's a package deal. It was celebratory for us, for having achieved something that we worked, all of us as a group, literally years for,\" the Twins' bench coach said. \"But at the same time, the humanitarian in you remembers that a lot of people lost their lives, their property, all the damage, so it was hard to feel that a game, a series, was important, with all that was going on around us.\"\n\nThat's because, 25 years ago today, Steinbach and the Oakland A's were at Candlestick Park, getting ready for Game 3 of the Bay Bridge Series, when the Loma Prieta earthquake hit. \"It seems like it was a just a couple years ago,\" Steinbach said. \"I remember it like it was.\"\n\nThe A's were a determined bunch that fall, intent upon not letting the previous year's disappointment against Kirk Gibson and the Dodgers repeat itself. Steinbach had been the hero of Game 2, belting a three-run homer off Rick Reuschel, but with Bob Welch scheduled to pitch Game 3 for the A's, Steinbach was told by manager Tony La Russa that he wouldn't be in the lineup that day.\n\n\"It was kind of a nice break, because when you're catching, you're always grinding. You're mind's constantly going,\" he said. \"So this was a chance for me to relax for a little while. I thought, 'Yeah, I'll see what this World Series stuff is all about.' \"\n\nHe was in the A's dugout, chatting with Oakland reliever Todd Burns, about a half-hour before first pitch, when a huge roar interrupted them. Steinbach figured it was a jet, perhaps part of the pregame ceremonies, \"but I didn't think they would let planes fly so low. It was really loud,\" he said. \"I looked up for the plane, and noticed that the concrete overhang above the upper deck was shaking, almost pulsating, like it was made of tin. But I knew, hey, that's concrete, and it's moving like you were flipping a jump rope.\"\n\nBy then, the bench he was sitting on had begun jerking violently, and it kept getting worse, \"for a good 8 to 10 seconds,\" Steinbach remembered. Burns, a southern Californian who had felt quakes before, jumped up and shouted, \"Earthquake!\" He and Steinbach hurried up the stairs to the field as the shaking subsided, and the crowd cheered. \"He said, 'Wow, that was a good one,' \" Steinbach said. \"I think everyone felt like, 'Hey, we survived, no damage. That was really memorable. Now let's go play ball.\"\n\nWithin a minute, however, the scoreboards and sound system suddenly shut off as power was lost in the ballpark. Rumors about damage around the city began spreading, but since cell phones were not yet commonplace and information was hard to come by, reports of a road collapse on the Bay Bridge, for instance, left the players wondering \"Is the bridge knocked over into the water? I mean, you just don't know.\"\n\nIt became apparent within about 20 minutes that the game would not be played, and players began signaling for their relatives to come out of the stands so they could leave. That's when a TV station recorded a famous video of Steinbach comforting his wife Mary, who was sobbing on his shoulder.\n\nThe moment is often interpreted as being overwhelmed by the danger of being in an earthquake, but Steinbach said that's not correct. \"The reason she was upset was, our daughter Jill was 2 years old, and she was across the bay in our apartment in Oakland, with a nanny,\" he said. \"Well, all the phones were out and we had no way to call and find out if she was safe. Today, you could just call and you'd know in a minute, but then -- you start to hear about buildings falling and people getting killed, and just not knowing was kind of frightening.\"\n\nThe fear wouldn't dissipate for four more hours, either; traffic was at a standstill on most Bay Area freeways, virtually every bridge had been closed until they could be inspected, and the A's team bus had to drive down the San Francisco peninsula to San Jose, then back north to Oakland, an excruciating journey, Steinbach said. \"But Jill was safe, everyone was fine,\" Steinbach said. \"And that's when you really start to understand how many people weren't so lucky.\"\n\nThe series finally resumed 10 days later, after a pregame ceremony that Steinbach says tops any other he's ever seen. Rescue workers and other heroes of that day, more than a dozen of them, gathered on the field to throw out the first pitch en masse, and Steinbach says he got a little emotional at the scene. \"The thing I was most proud of was that we -- both teams -- got to be part of the healing process,\" he said. \"What better way to show the world that, yes, a major catastrophe happened, but we are recovering. The Bay Area is resilient, and we're going to get through this.\"","1115":"Stillwater Lift Bridge to go up in anticipation of boat traffic The Minnesota Department of Transportation will raise the bridge and lock it in place starting next Friday.\n\nStillwater's iconic Lift Bridge will be raised next week in anticipation of ice-out on the St. Croix River.\n\nThe Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT) will raise the bridge and lock it in place starting next Friday to allow for boat traffic.

DEAH helicases work by translocating along RNA and thereby unwind RNA duplexes or dissociate bound proteins. Because DEAH proteins are poor enzymes without intrinsic selectivity for target RNAs, they require adapter proteins that recruit them to functional sites and enhance their catalytic activity. One essential class of DEAH activators is formed by G-patch proteins, which bind helicases via their eponymous glycine-rich motif. We solved the structure of a G-patch bound to helicase DHX15. Our analysis suggests that G-patches tether mobile sections of DEAH helicases together and activate them by stabilizing a functional conformation with high RNA affinity.\n\nRNA helicases of the DEAH\/RHA family are involved in many essential cellular processes, such as splicing or ribosome biogenesis, where they remodel large RNA-protein complexes to facilitate transitions to the next intermediate. DEAH helicases couple adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis to conformational changes of their catalytic core. This movement results in translocation along RNA, which is held in place by auxiliary C-terminal domains. The activity of DEAH proteins is strongly enhanced by the large and diverse class of G-patch activators. Despite their central roles in RNA metabolism, insight into the molecular basis of G-patch-mediated helicase activation is missing. Here, we have solved the structure of human helicase DHX15\/Prp43, which has a dual role in splicing and ribosome assembly, in complex with the G-patch motif of the ribosome biogenesis factor NKRF. The G-patch motif binds in an extended conformation across the helicase surface. It tethers the catalytic core to the flexibly attached C-terminal domains, thereby fixing a conformation that is compatible with RNA binding. Structures in the presence or absence of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) suggest that motions of the catalytic core, which are required for ATP binding, are still permitted. Concomitantly, RNA affinity, helicase, and ATPase activity of DHX15 are increased when G-patch is bound. Mutations that detach one end of the tether but maintain overall binding severely impair this enhancement. Collectively, our data suggest that the G-patch motif acts like a flexible brace between dynamic portions of DHX15 that restricts excessive domain motions but maintains sufficient flexibility for catalysis.","1118":"Structural basis for recognition of RALF peptides by LRX proteins during pollen tube growth Plant reproduction relies on proper pollen tube growth to reach the female gametes. This process is highly regulated by a family of secreted signaling peptides that are recognized by cell-wall monitoring proteins to enable plant fertilization. Here, we report that these signaling peptides are sensed both by specific cell-wall and membrane-anchored proteins, which together enable cell-wall remodeling and, consequently, pollen tube growth.\n\nPlant reproduction relies on the highly regulated growth of the pollen tube for sperm delivery. This process is controlled by secreted RALF signaling peptides, which have previously been shown to be perceived by Catharanthus roseus RLK1-like (CrRLK1Ls) membrane receptor-kinases\/LORELEI-like GLYCOLPHOSPHATIDYLINOSITOL (GPI)-ANCHORED PROTEINS (LLG) complexes, or by leucine-rich repeat (LRR) extensin proteins (LRXs). Here, we demonstrate that RALF peptides fold into bioactive, disulfide bond-stabilized proteins that bind the LRR domain of LRX proteins with low nanomolar affinity. Crystal structures of LRX2-RALF4 and LRX8-RALF4 complexes at 3.2- and 3.9-\u00c5 resolution, respectively, reveal a dimeric arrangement of LRX proteins, with each monomer binding one folded RALF peptide. Structure-based mutations targeting the LRX-RALF4 complex interface, or the RALF4 fold, reduce RALF4 binding to LRX8 in vitro and RALF4 function in growing pollen tubes. Mutants targeting the disulfide-bond stabilized LRX dimer interface fail to rescue lrx infertility phenotypes. Quantitative biochemical assays reveal that RALF4 binds LLGs and LRX cell-wall modules with drastically different binding affinities, and with distinct and mutually exclusive binding modes. Our biochemical, structural, and genetic analyses reveal a complex signaling network by which RALF ligands instruct different signaling proteins using distinct targeting mechanisms.","1119":"Sufficiency of CD40 activation and immune checkpoint blockade for T cell priming and tumor immunity We report that CD40 activation can provide an immunological \"missing link\" by priming T cells and synergizing with immune checkpoint blockade in a highly refractory pancreas cancer genetic mouse model. The underlying mechanism is mediated by CD40 ligation, representing an alternative molecular pathway distinct from pattern recognition receptor stimulation that connects dendritic cell activation to adaptive immunity, enabling T cell priming that is otherwise unachievable in pancreatic cancer.\n\nInnate immune receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) provide critical molecular links between innate cells and adaptive immune responses. Here, we studied the CD40 pathway as an alternative bridge between dendritic cells (DCs) and adaptive immunity in cancer. Using an experimental design free of chemo- or radiotherapy, we found CD40 activation with agonistic antibodies (\u237aCD40) produced complete tumor regressions in a therapy-resistant pancreas cancer model, but only when combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). This effect, unachievable with ICB alone, was independent of TLR, STING, or IFNAR pathways. Mechanistically, \u03b1CD40\/ICB primed durable T cell responses, and efficacy required DCs and host expression of CD40. Moreover, ICB drove optimal generation of polyfunctional T cells in this \"cold\" tumor model, instead of rescuing T cell exhaustion. Thus, immunostimulation via \u03b1CD40 is sufficient to synergize with ICB for priming. Clinically, combination \u03b1CD40\/ICB may extend efficacy in patients with \"cold\" and checkpoint-refractory tumors.","1120":"Sun Country announces one-day flash sale $19-$49 each-way from MSP to 6 cities Sun Country is having a one day flash sale on fares to six U.S. cities with one-way fares from $19 to $49.\n\nTickets must be purchased before midnight on Friday, Sept. 13.

First-time finalists India were beaten by 85 runs but the unbeaten run before that is an indicator that things are moving in the right direction, said Gavaskar.\n\n\"To Sourav Ganguly and the BCCI, I would like to say, maybe next year, look at having a women's IPL because that will unearth a lot more talent. There is already a lot of talent which we see and that will come to the fore with this performance of this Indian team throughout this tournament,\" he told 'India Today'.\n\nGavaskar said a WIPL should be on cards even if there's isn't enough Indian talent to have an eight-team IPL.\n\n\"Even if there are not 8 teams, a women's IPL will make a lot of sense. There will be a lot more exposure for women. A lot more talent, which is there but we don't know at the moment will come to the fore.

Open up a fresh jar of cardamom, inhale the smell, and you'll see what I mean!\n\nA wonderful way to highlight this spice is with Swedish Cardamom Buns. It has cardamom in three places: the dough, the filling, and the topping! The aroma as they bake is really lovely. They're soft, buttery, and spicy. You might need to learn a couple of new techniques to pull these off, but it's well worth the extra effort.\n\nOkay, let's get to making some Swedish Cardamom Buns!\n\nHere's everything you'll need for making the dough: active dry yeast, whole milk, salted butter, an egg, ground cardamom, salt, sugar, and all-purpose flour.\n\nNow, you can use pre-ground cardamom in this recipe if you don't want to hunt down cardamom seeds and grind them yourself. The flavor won't be quite as bright, but it will still be very good. You can also pop the seeds out of cardamom pods if that's all you can find.\n\nI had Reuben crush the seeds in my mortar and pestle, but you could also use a spice grinder.\n\nFirst of all, you want to get the yeast activated. Warm the milk to 110\u00b0F and sprinkle the yeast on top. Set aside to proof for 5 minutes.\n\nAdd the remaining ingredients along with the yeast mixture to the bowl of a stand mixer.\n\nBriefly mix the dough with a spatula to form a shaggy dough.\n\nSwitch to the dough hook and knead the dough until quite elastic, about 15 minutes. That may seem like a long time to knead the dough. However, I've found that it's necessary to knead longer than most recipes recommend to develop the gluten properly.\n\nCover and allow to rise in a warm spot until doubled, about 1 \u00bd to 2 hours.\n\nOnce the dough has risen, roll it out to a 14 by 20-inch rectangle on a well-buttered surface with a buttered rolling pin. The dough is very soft, so you want to grease everything to ensure that it doesn't stick.\n\nNow it's time to make the filling. Here's what you'll need: salted butter, sugar, and ground cardamom.\n\nBeat together all of the filling ingredients well.\n\nDot the filling over the surface of the rolled out dough.\n\nUse an offset spatula to spread the filling out evenly over the dough.\n\nGrabbing a short edge, fold 1\/3 of the dough over itself.\n\nFold the other third of the dough over. It's kind of like folding a letter!\n\nCut across the dough (starting at a folded edge), making 3\/4-inch strips.\n\nThere are a couple of ways you can form these Swedish cardamom buns. Let's start with the fancier version.\n\nCut a strip of dough down its length, leaving only a little bit uncut at the end.\n\n... and then twist the legs around themselves in the opposite direction.\n\nCoil the twisted dough around itself, tucking the end underneath the bun.\n\nPlace on an ungreased baking sheet. You want to put plenty of space between the buns since they expand quite a bit. I should have given them a little more space here.\n\nOkay, now let me show you the faster way to form these Swedish cardamom buns.\n\nGrab a piece of dough and wrap it around your fingers like a bandage.\n\nGrab the end of the dough, pull it through the center of the \"bandage\" you just formed, and tuck it underneath the bun.\n\nHere's what they should look like when they're formed.\n\nCover and allow to rise until they're quite puffy, about 1 1\/2 to 2 more hours.\n\nPreheat your oven to 425\u00b0F. Bake the buns until deep golden, about 15-20 minutes. They'll be quite dark on the bottom. You can check their doneness by inserting an instant-read thermometer into one: it should register 200\u00b0F.\n\nMeanwhile, it's time to make the topping for these Swedish cardamom buns. Here's what you'll need: water, sugar, vanilla extract, ground cardamom, and salt.\n\nPlace everything except the cardamom in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.\n\nBrush the hot baked buns with the syrup. Allow to cool for a few minutes, then brush them again. You can repeat once more if desired.\n\nAllow to cool as long as you can stand it, and serve with butter and a cup of coffee or tea.","1126":"Sympatric speciation of wild emmer wheat driven by ecology and chromosomal rearrangements This article requires a subscription to view the full text. If you have a subscription you may use the login form below to view the article. Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nIn plants, which are stressed constantly by diverse abiotic and biotic stresses, ecological divergence is substantial in driving speciation, yet its demonstration under sympatry is still limited in plants and needs elaboration. By analyzing wild emmer wheat at the Evolution Canyon microsite, a hot spot of sympatric speciation, we highlighted how disruptive ecological selection drives primary sympatric speciation in situ. Natural selection, overruling the homogenizing effects of gene flow, split the metapopulation of wild emmer wheat into three reproductively isolated populations. Each population evolved unique evolutionary trajectory with divergent adaptive strategies, including fungal disease resistance, irradiance tolerance, and divergent flowering time. Our work provides a model for plant adaptive ecological sympatric speciation under biotic and abiotic stressors.","1127":"Synthesis of phosphoramidate-linked DNA by a modified DNA polymerase Edited by John Chaput, University of California, Irvine, CA, and accepted by Editorial Board Member Stephen J. Benkovic February 20, 2020 (received for review December 19, 2019)\n\nLife on Earth depends on polymerases. These enzymes copy genetic information to produce the DNA and RNA strands at the core of the central dogma. Polymerases act by forming phosphodiester linkages to produce polynucleotide strands. While synthetic chemistry can generate a broad range of alternative genetic materials with unnatural linkages, polymerases have so far been limited to forming O-P bonds. Here, we show that, in fact, unnatural N-P bonds can also be formed by a modified DNA polymerase. This template-directed activity generates complementary strands linked by phosphoramidate (NP) esters, an alternative backbone linkage only known to exist in the laboratory. The emergence of NP-DNA polymerase activity implies the biochemical plausibility of alternative central dogmas for cellular life.","1128":"Tamim Iqbal Replaces Mashrafe Mortaza As Bangladesh ODI Captain | Cricket News Bangladesh on Sunday named opening batsman Tamim Iqbal as captain of the national one-day side, replacing pace bowler Mashrafe Mortaza.

We hope Tamim would serve for a long term,\" he added.\n\nTamim earlier led Bangladesh in three ODIs against Sri Lanka in July last year in the absence of the injured Mashrafe, but failed to inspire the team with Bangladesh losing all three matches.\n\nHis fresh tenure as ODI captain will start with the one-off match against Pakistan on April 1.","1129":"Target offers 10% off Target gift cards this Sunday, Dec. 8 Target shoppers who've gotten used to the annual 10% discount on its gift cards can look forward to the promotion again this Sunday, Dec. 8. It's the only discounter to offer such a deal. Walmart and Kmart have yet offer it.\n\nSome consumers questioned whether Target would offer the gift card discount this year after it dropped its 15% off site-wide Cyber Monday sale. Some analysts think that because Target has performed so well this year, it didn't need to offer the discount.\n\nThe sale is offered in stores and on Target.com. A minimum of $10 and a maximum of $300 can be purchased. Last year consumers noted online that they were able to purchase more than $300 by paying with different credit cards or paying in cash. Redcard holders do not receive an addtional 5% discount if paying with a Redcard. Consumers wanting an additional perk can pay with a credit card that offers points or a 1% rebate.\n\nDiscounted gift cards can be used starting Monday, Dec. 9 at 10 a.m. CST, according to a Target press release.\n\nThe gift card promo can only be used to purchase Target gift cards, not other gift cards such as Target Visa, MasterCard, American Express or restaurant or retailer cards. Also, Target gift cards cannot be used as payment to buy other gift cards such as an Apple App Store & iTunes card.","1130":"Targeted inhibition of gut bacterial \u03b2-glucuronidase activity enhances anticancer drug efficacy Cancer chemotherapy often causes side effects that require modulations in dosing, which then reduce anticancer efficacy. Here, we show that targeted inhibition of gut bacterial enzymes alleviates key stages of gut epithelial damage caused by the cancer drug irinotecan, blunts stark gut microbial compositional shifts caused by irinotecan, and enhances irinotecan's antitumor effectiveness by reducing its gastrointestinal toxicity.\n\nIrinotecan treats a range of solid tumors, but its effectiveness is severely limited by gastrointestinal (GI) tract toxicity caused by gut bacterial \u03b2-glucuronidase (GUS) enzymes. Targeted bacterial GUS inhibitors have been shown to partially alleviate irinotecan-induced GI tract damage and resultant diarrhea in mice. Here, we unravel the mechanistic basis for GI protection by gut microbial GUS inhibitors using in vivo models. We use in vitro, in fimo, and in vivo models to determine whether GUS inhibition alters the anticancer efficacy of irinotecan. We demonstrate that a single dose of irinotecan increases GI bacterial GUS activity in 1 d and reduces intestinal epithelial cell proliferation in 5 d, both blocked by a single dose of a GUS inhibitor. In a tumor xenograft model, GUS inhibition prevents intestinal toxicity and maintains the antitumor efficacy of irinotecan. Remarkably, GUS inhibitor also effectively blocks the striking irinotecan-induced bloom of Enterobacteriaceae in immune-deficient mice. In a genetically engineered mouse model of cancer, GUS inhibition alleviates gut damage, improves survival, and does not alter gut microbial composition; however, by allowing dose intensification, it dramatically improves irinotecan's effectiveness, reducing tumors to a fraction of that achieved by irinotecan alone, while simultaneously promoting epithelial regeneration. These results indicate that targeted gut microbial enzyme inhibitors can improve cancer chemotherapeutic outcomes by protecting the gut epithelium from microbial dysbiosis and proliferative crypt damage.","1131":"Tech Moves: David Shim to lead Foursquare-Factual merged company; former Gates Foundation CEO joins Pfizer board; and more -- Location data companies Foursquare and Factual are merging.

Violet Wang, a Chinese citizen, tells us that she also finds a welcome reprieve in funny TikTok videos.","1137":"The Art of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is a stunning look at the movie The Art of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is available now and offers a visually stunning behind-the-scenes look at the movie.\n\nWith the Skywalker saga over, fans of Star Wars will be looking to find more ways to interact with their favorite fandom now that we won't be seeing any movies for some time. And for those Star Wars fans who are looking to expand upon their Star Wars collection during these times,The Art of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, written by Phil Szostak, may be the next item they add to their collection.\n\nThe book, available now, is a stunning look at the making of not only The Rise of Skywalker, but it also gives readers some insight into the making of previous movies as well -- including a sizeable portion of the book dedicated to Episode VIII: The Last Jedi.\n\nThis book pulls double duty as an amazing coffee table-like book filled with endless pages of amazing artwork for the film. But make no mistake, it's also filled with so much information in regard to how the movie was developed and what it took to artistically get the movie looking the way it did. There are interviews from directors J.J. Abrams and Rian Johnson, The Clone Wars supervising director Dave Filoni, and so much more. The book was sent to FanSided courtesy of Abrams Books, and we're able to provide a breakdown of just a few things you can expect to see in The Art of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.\n\nEveryone knows that Star Wars has a distinct look to it when it comes to costumes and fashion, and the designers working on The Rise of Skywalker spared no expense in getting the looks right. There are some surprises throughout, such as the different variations of \"Dark Reys\" that could have appeared during the vision on the Death Star.\n\nFans may also enjoy seeing how the designs for the cool red Sith Troopers came to be, or how Lando's new wardrobe was inspired by young Lando's look in Solo. As Szostak tweeted below, you also even find out that one of Rey's outfits were design to pay homage to Leia from A New Hope.\n\nFrom the book:\n\n\"I thought white would look great. And then we added a hood to give it more of a Jedi vibe. It's also a bit of Leia from the side. I based it on the Leia hood from A New Hope.\" [Glyn] Dillon\n\nFans of all the creatures Star Wars comes up with will love to dig into the minds of Neal Scanlan and his team, who worked on these creations. On the more adorable side, you see how creations like D-O or Babu Frik came to be. D-O, according to the designs, was modeled off of the shape of a duckling, being nicknamed in the book \"duckling droid.\"\n\nFor fan favorite Babu Frik, creator Ivan Manzella described the following in the book:\n\n\"J.J. wanted Babu to be kind of like an insect at first, but he didn't really respond to those designs. Then, one night at home, I was sketching and drew a figure with a hood and helmet. And I decided to do a quick sculpt that weekend, which J.J. liked. That became the starting point for Babu. Then it was just a matter of refining him.\" Manzella\n\nAt the end of the day, sometimes it really comes down to the sets and locations that make Star Wars, well, Star Wars. From the series, we've gotten iconic locations like Hoth and Coruscant and amazing set pieces like the Emperor's throne room and pretty much everything you saw in Cloud City. And this art book shows what fans didn't get to see in the process of setting the stage for scenes like the ones on Mustafar and Exogol.\n\nFor example, in the final cut of The Rise of Skywalker, a lot was left out in regard to Kylo Ren's quest for the Wayfinder and more. This book includes recountings about the scenes with the now-removed Oracle that was supposed to appear as well as what Mustafar could have looked like after Anakin's fall to the Dark Side.\n\nFor that specific setting, Industrial Light and Magic London art director Kevin Jenkins described his process as the following in the book:\n\n\"J.J. fell in love with this creature and wanted some exposition for Kylo. So the Oracle has moved with the planet every time. My challenge, at the moment, is how to evolve Mustafar so that maybe the lava has dried up a bit. It's not as volcanic as it was, and there's going to be a broken Vader castle in the background. What's happened to this planet since we've been there? I suppose it's been maybe 40 years since we were last there. I'm trying to imagine how the planet might have evolved. And then what can we do that makes it our own and have the audience discover where they are rather than see it immediately.\" Jenkins\n\nThose excerpts and drawings are just a drop in the bucket of what fans will find when they open up the pages of The Art of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. And fans need not wait because the book is now available. Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is also out now on home release.","1138":"The Best Beauty and Fashion Deals This Week If you're looking to save right now, you're in luck as many retailers and brands are currently offering big online deals.

And while they are all closed right now, nothing can stop us from dreaming about the vacations we will take there when this is over. Read on for a guide to a dream trip to Vegas.\n\nThe first Nobu Hotel, and a pioneer in the hotel-within-a-hotel concept, Nobu Hotel Las Vegas is located within Caesars Palace on the Vegas Strip. A high end boutique hotel located within one of the Vegas juggernauts comes with more than a few perks. All Nobu guests enjoy: access to the Nobu Hotel business lounge, a Dedicated fitness center, VIP skip-the-line privilege at Omnia Nightclub, 24 hour in-room dining and access to Qua Baths & Spa.\n\nNow let's look at the check in experience. Unlike checking into one of the mega hotels, where check in lines can sometimes be hours long, check in at Nobu is a breeze. After walking into their check in area, you will be promptly checked-in and the team will then show you to your room or suite. Oh and by the way, no waiting for elevators either, due to the intimate nature of the property, one of the three elevators will come almost immediately when called.\n\nOnce you get to your room, you can expect a chic Vegas spin on modern Japanese-style d\u00e9cor. In the 1,000-square-foot Hakone Suites, guests enjoy a truly VIP experience, inclusive of a full bar area, pool table, large living room, separate movie room, spacious bedroom and a spa-like bathroom. The space is a quiet respite from the bustling streets of Vegas.\n\nAnother perk of this being the first Nobu Hotel, Chef Nobu specially crafted the in-room dining for their property and you won't find their signature \"Nobu Breakfast\" items anywhere else. The \"Nobu Breakfast Bento\" is certainly worth a try; it is an excellent way to start the day.\n\nThe foodie couple should be sure to sign up for a private cooking class with Executive Chef Nicolas Costagliola at Guy Savoy. The class begins with Chef Costagliola explaining the menu you will be creating. The menu in the restaurant changes with the seasons, so the dishes prepared during the cooking class change frequently as well, but typically there will be an appetizer, entr\u00e9e and dessert.\n\nMost recently, guests learned how to make their chestnut soup and roasted lamb alongside Chef Costagliola.\n\nChef Costagliola takes guests into the kitchen where he guides them in preparing the ingredients, firing them on the stove and even plating dishes worthy of a Michelin star. And after all the hard work is done, guests get to enjoy the menu they helped prepare at their exclusive Krug Chef's Table, with some expertly paired glasses of wine. I can't think of a better way to spend an afternoon. The private classes are available Wednesday through Sunday and last 3 hours, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.\n\nAfter enjoying a sumptuous meal, you may want to walk off a few of the calories by exploring the Vegas Strip. Caesars is centrally located so whether you head north or south, there is lots to see and explore.\n\nOne stop to add to your route is just across the street though. For thrill seekers, head up to the Fly Linq Zipline Vegas. Yes, you can take a zipline over the Linq promenade, but it gets better, you land at the High Roller, which is the largest observation wheel in the world -- even larger than the London Eye. But wait, it gets even more \"Vegas\" than that. The High Roller offers tickets for a 30-minute open bar ride in addition to standard tickets. So after an exhilarating zip over the Linq Promenade, head to the High Roller for a 30-minute open bar complete with 360 degree views. \"Happy Half Hour\" tickets are available daily from 12 pm -1 am. Guests must be 21 and older to ride in a bar cabin.\n\nA weekend in Vegas can be anything you want it to be. Vegas is known for its high octane experiences, but some of its best experiences are relaxing. After an exciting Saturday, perhaps you'll want to spend Sunday at the spa. The Qua Baths & Spa at Caesars is available to guests at the Nobu and they are certainly worth a visit. Not only do they offer a variety of Roman bath, aqua-therapy experiences, but the service list includes a selection of Nobu specific treatments. The 80-minute Nobu Zen Couples Massage uses a combination of aromatherapy, hot stones and traditional massage techniques to thoroughly relax.\n\nVegas has no shortage of nightlife available. But for the couple looking to treat themselves to a romantic and fun night out, start with dinner at Giada at the Cromwell. Enjoy some Italian classics with a fabulous views of the Strip and the lights of the nearby Paris hotel. Then after dinner, head back to Caesars to stop at the popular Vanderpump Cocktail Garden. Be sure to make a reservation, they get quite busy each night. The photo worthy cocktails and exclusive ambiance are just what you want when getting your evening started in Vegas. Where to go next is up to you.","1142":"The Forgotten Beretta 92 Pistol USA - -(Ammoland.com)- Do you remember the first time that you saw a Beretta 92?\n\nIt may have been while watching an action film from the 1980s such as Lethal Weapon or Die Hard or a thriller from the 1990s like Leon: The Professional.\n\nPerhaps movies aren't your thing and it was on active or reserve duty with the US Military over the past 30 years or on duty with a law enforcement agency.\n\nWhenever it was, for three decades the Beretta 92 in all of its configurations was one of the most popular 9mm handguns on the market, selling between $500 and $1000 and bringing imitations from Brazil, Egypt, Turkey, and Romania. Then things went south for the venerable model and today used and surplus Beretta 92s can be had for as little as $329.\n\nWhen the 92 series debuted, it was a revolution in the firearms world. The pistol was double action, held 15 rounds of 9mm in the magazine and the open-top slide made it look vastly different than its predecessors such as the 1911, Browning Hi-Power, CZ, Smith & Wesson semi-autos, etc. In the 1980s, it was the pistol to have. Glocks were new on the scene and had taken a bad rap for their polymer frames; Sig Sauer pistols were deemed to be too expensive.\n\nBeretta made basic changes along the way to the base model. A version came out with a more vertical grip frame known as the Vertec. The Inox models in stainless steel became available, as did an enclosed barrel model dubbed the Centurion. Double-action only models were made for customers that refused to learn anything about shooting apart from how their double-action K-frame revolver felt. The late 1990s ushered in frames with rails so we could hang lights and lasers on them.\n\nYet, the market grew smaller.\n\nOther companies were offering pistols with better triggers, lighter frames, increased magazine capacity, and simplified maintenance. The misguided 1994 Federal Assault Weapon Ban made people shift to larger calibers that held closer to 10 rounds than 15. When concealed carry became a reality in many states, people did not want full-sized service pistols in their holsters; they wanted something lighter. As most police departments moved on to other firearms, so did much of the civilian firearm market.\n\nWith active duty military and veterans, there were ebbs of nostalgia; yet that group seemed split into two camps: one side that loved the Beretta M9 and the other that did not.\n\nPerhaps the biggest hit that the Beretta 92 series took was when it was announced that it would be replaced after serving US forces as a sidearm since 1985. The armchair commandos came out in full force citing that it was time to move up to a 45 ACP handgun, screaming from the mountaintops how the bigger caliber had better results.\n\nThis, of course, is not entirely accurate. Most of the shootings with a handgun in 45 ACP were at the hands of Special Forces, Navy SEAL, Marine Recon or Delta Operator. The 9mm was more typically wielded by cooks, truck drivers or mortar men in a line unit. The comparison is one of apples to oranges as the typical cook, mortar man or truck driver simply does not have the same level of training as a tier-one warfighter. The real output of those shooting incidents is more of shot placement. A trained shooter will simply be more accurate and hence, more deadly with a pistol than a troop who is not as well trained.\n\nNow retired Beretta 92s are hitting the police trade-in market in droves, with the average retail price between $300 and $400. The author picked one up for a sense of nostalgia. I had been in the camp that disliked the Beretta and had not shot an M9 since the early 1990s while serving as a US Marine. Over the years I had contemplated adding one to the collection but found better firearms at the same price.\n\nIt was beaten up and rough on the outside, but like new on the inside. We took her out to the desert to run a box of ammo through her and she was reliable and accurate. The Model 92 was made for shooting and three decades of service use mean there are a lot of spare parts and aftermarket accessories for this fine old warhorse.\n\nIt may not make the carry rotation but would serve fine as a home defense pistol, \"truck gun\" or just an excellent shooter to make noise on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nMike Searson's career as a shooter began as a Marine Rifleman at age 17. He has worked in the firearms industry his entire adult life as a Gunsmith, Ballistician, Consultant, Salesman, Author and was first certified to teach firearms safety in 1989.\n\nMike has written over 2000 articles for a number of magazines, websites and newsletters including Blade, RECOIL, OFF-GRID, Tactical Officer, SWAT, Tactical World, Gun Digest, Examiner.com and the US Concealed Carry Association.","1143":"The Gear Trap Is a Problem, but Cheap Equipment Can Also Limit You | Most of us are familiar with \"the gear trap,\" the fine line that's crossed when a shooter makes a top priority of continually researching and purchasing newer and better camera equipment. This can be a dangerous money pit. But there are times when your gear must be upgraded, lest you suffer the technical shortcomings of outdated or inadequate equipment.\n\nIf you entered a camera store before quarantine hit, you might have waltzed in just meaning to buy an $8 pack of microfiber cloths, only to stumble out the door with several impulse purchases. These could range from small accessories to a shiny new camera body that blew you away with its bells and whistles.\n\nAny of us can catch gadget fever. And convincing people that they need everything \"new and improved\" has been the goal of advertisers since the beginning of consumer capitalism. This stimulus and behavior fuels our world economy (may it soon recover) and keeps productivity churning along. But when do we cross the line from resourceful expenditure to self-indulgent consumerism? Since the answer varies based upon a shooter's professional demands weighed against resources, this is no easy judgment to make.\n\nThough it may appear excessive to an outsider, my interior photography setup is fairly minimal.\n\nTo quote the famed fiction writer Chuck Palahniuk:\n\nAre these things really better than the things I already have? Or am I just trained to be dissatisfied with what I have now?\n\nThis article is aimed primarily at professionals, since paid photographers have the most to lose by not using pro-level camera gear. It's not meant as elitist. Many hobbyists create essential work, which they enjoy sharing and selling to admiring fans. But the reputations and financial stakes of professionals are necessarily higher.\n\nSince the camera market usually churns out new gear at a breakneck rate (at the moment, not so much), constant upgrades can be tempting for anyone with a camera body or lens model that is several years or even just several months old.\n\nFrom my experience and what others in my field have noted, those most susceptible to the \"gear trap\" seem to be those arguably least in need of top-of-the-line equipment: hobbyists. The consensus is that many newcomers eagerly seek out better gear (typically camera bodies) in hopes that the equipment will improve their image quality.\n\nMost of us who have any photography expertise or experience have been asked more than once the shooter's perpetual question: \"Which camera should I buy?\" The obvious reply is a gentle reminder to focus first on learning the craft of photography. As many famous photographic figures have repeatedly pointed out, one can take good or even amazing images with the most basic camera gear.\n\nThis approach -- that gear is less essential than the gear handler -- has a musical analogy. A master guitarist can pick up a $10 Hello Kitty guitar from Walmart and shred away brilliantly, often to the amazement of everyone listening. \"See,\" an admirer might exclaim. \"It's all in the player's talent, not the rig they're playing on!\"\n\nBut what about the exceptions to this rule?\n\nA Story With a Caution\n\nI'd like to share a story with you. Though it involves a painful mishap, it taught me a valuable lesson and might have one for some of our readers.\n\nSeveral years ago, I was hired by a large national corporation to photograph their annual conference. I had been specializing in corporate event photography for about two years before this, after receiving a bachelor's degree in photography, then dabbling in weddings and other random shoots. These shoots had been executed with nearly zero hiccups, and I was confident in my ability to capture images in practically any situation.\n\nBut there was something I hadn't realized up to this point: the limits imposed by one piece of subpar gear I had been using for years.\n\nMy client was running the production of this significant event, from the A\/V to the photo and video. He also had a background in photography and, as I found out, a keen eye for visual perfection. After sending him image samples from the first day, I got a call the following morning.\n\nGood morning, Scott. I've looked through your photos. And, to be honest, some of them are just not good, sir.\n\nOf course, this was the last thing I wanted to hear from someone who had paid me well and placed his trust in me. But there was still another day of shooting ahead of us, allowing me to make things right.\n\nUpon meeting the following morning, my client pulled up the images on a laptop and zoomed in on several of the \"welcome keynote\" shots. The problem was apparent: a moderate lack of image sharpness, relative at least to the pro standard.\n\nThis came as a surprise to me. I knew that I hadn't goofed up on shutter speed. Several years of teaching photography workshops had drilled the appropriate low-light settings and reciprocity rules into my brain. I hadn't jolted the camera as I shot, either. Stability has always been important to me, especially when capturing handheld in low-light conditions.\n\nIf the problem did not lie in my shooting, where was it coming from? I quickly realized that the lack of sharpness was caused by the lens I was then using. I had been shooting in the back of a 2,000-seat auditorium, zoomed in at 300mm, snapping away on a used off-brand zoom. That lens, I'd always assumed, was good enough. It had passed the scrutiny of dozens of clients, but it only took one keen set of eyes to notice that this gear was not quite good enough, at least under certain conditions.\n\nWhile discussing with my client his proper criticism of my shots, I did not blame the lens. There was a mutual understanding that the gear I used for the opening ceremony wasn't quite pro-level, but we avoided that awkward conversation. I offered to rent a higher quality lens to capture the sharper images he sought out. The client declined a rental, instead moving my position closer to the stage for a re-shoot of the same speech during the conference's next session. This would fix any aberration or loss of sharpness from zooming (which tends to be an issue only with lower-end zoom lenses).\n\nIn the end, we worked together to produce professional images. I was lucky.\n\nWhat was the first thing I did when the conference ended? I invested in a high-quality, fast Nikon zoom lens, and I never have since run into an issue with sharpness decreasing while zooming. The richness of color and overall picture quality of my current zoom has produced an excellent product for my clients and great value for me.\n\nSummary\n\nIf you suspect you suffer from \"gear acquisition syndrome,\" you probably do. Likely only a handful of the photographers out there fretting about their gear would benefit from upgrading as often as they do. But those who choose not to update when necessary can risk a lot, especially if they are in the dark on the limitations of their equipment. I was fortunate to come out of my \"cheap lens\" experience without a bad review or damaged reputation, but not everyone is so lucky.\n\nWhich has been the more significant challenge for you: the problem of the \"gear trap\" or the consequences of sub-par equipment?

It was Presidents' Day; the theme was memoirs by first ladies. Like lots of nerdy subcultures, the crossword puzzle has a buzzing ecosystem, and it whirred into action. Hoelscher posted a photo of the newspaper her husband rose early on his day off to buy, and veteran crossword constructors, as they're called, offered congratulations in a Facebook group that develops constructors from underrepresented groups. Some of the Times' 600,000 digital-crossword subscribers finished Hoelscher's puzzle with their thumbs, extending their solving streaks, and crossword bloggers (yes, they exist) favorably reviewed the puzzle's theme, non-thematic vocabulary, and clues.\n\nIn comments sections on crossword blogs, alongside off-color jokes about hypothetical titles for a Melania Trump memoir, a debate raged. Jenni Levy, an internist and a writer on the review site Diary of a Crossword Fiend, applauded how Hoelscher's puzzle \"passe[d] the crossword Bechdel test.\" But Levy bemoaned a \"missed opportunity.\"\n\n\"I went through looking for men's names with mounting excitement: What if there weren't any?\" she wrote. Alas, 66-Across, DEE, was clued as \"Billy ___ Williams,\" not as the letter or the grade. Responding to Levy's lament, a commenter wondered: \"Why is it desirable\/necessary to have women's names predominate in crossword puzzles ... I ignore the male\/female body count.\" Levy's response was a perfect, full-throated call to arms for inclusivity in the crossworld:\n\nBecause women are underrepresented in puzzle content and creation. Clues and answers that are stereotypically masculine are \"general interest;\" clues and answers that are stereotypically feminine are \"niche\" or \"obscure\" ... We're so far from [parity] that a few puzzles with exclusively women's names wouldn't get us there ... [and feminism here means] \"we acknowledge the systemic forces that threaten women, we speak up when we see those forces represented in crosswords, and we call on our community to do better.\"\n\nHoelscher appeared, replied to Levy, and said she'd submitted the puzzle with no men, but wasn't surprised when the Times editors changed that.\n\nCrossword editors are strange arbiters of cultural relevance. Read tweets by Awkwafina or Olivia Wilde on learning that they've been immortalized in the black-and-white grid -- it's the bookish version of handprints on a slab outside Grauman's Chinese Theatre. But any pub-trivia attendee -- exposed to categories on craft beer or things that smell like sourdough or whatever the emcee is into -- will tell you that personnel is policy. That crossword mainstays such as The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, and The Wall Street Journal are largely written, edited, fact-checked, and test-solved by older white men dictates what makes it into the 15x15 grid and what's kept out.\n\nPlay: The Atlantic crossword\n\nWhen editors review a puzzle submission, they mark it up -- minus signs next to obscurities or variant spellings, check marks next to lively vocabulary. But one editor's demerit is another solver's lexicon. Constructors constantly argue with editors that their culture is puzzle-worthy, only to hear feedback greased by bias, and occasionally outright sexism or racism. (Publications are anonymized in the editor feedback that follows.) MARIE KONDO wouldn't be familiar enough \"to most solvers, especially with that unusual last name.\" GAY EROTICA is an \"envelope-pusher that risks solver reactions.\" (According to XWord Info, a blog that tracks crossword statistics, EROTICA has appeared in the New York Times puzzle, as one example, more than 40 times since 1950.) BLACK GIRLS ROCK \"might elicit unfavorable responses.\" FLAVOR FLAV, in a puzzle I wrote, earned a minus sign.\n\n\"Popular music,\" the American Values Club crossword editor Ben Tausig told me, \"where lots of young women and people of color are visible, is regularly dismissed as too ephemeral for a 'Great Crossword Puzzle.'\" He added, \"Ephemerality is the code word; exclusion is the result.\"\n\nAnd while some corners of culture are kept out of crosswords, some troubling aspects of language creep in. The New York Times puzzle has weathered deep sensitivity issues of late, including allowing a racial slur in the grid in January 2019, despite unequivocal protestations from those who saw the puzzle prepublication. Other transgressions include clues for ILLEGAL (\"One caught by border patrol\"); MEN (\"Exasperated comment from a feminist\"); and HOOD (\"Place with homies\"). In many cases, editorial changes warp a constructor's original, inoffensive clue.\n\nRead: How Will Shortz edits a New York Times crossword puzzle\n\nWill Shortz, the Puzzles editor at the Times, has cited low submission rates from underrepresented groups as one reason for lack of constructor parity, but tone deafness and opacity can put constructors off the newspaper. (I was once Shortz's editorial assistant, and I contribute crosswords to the Times.) In a Facebook thread with Shortz and other commenters, Rebecca Falcon, a 30-year-old constructor, posted: \"I can't feel good about putting my work into an outlet that I feel has very different values than my own.\" She continued: \"Is there anything being done to address these issues?\" Shortz gave a thoughtful answer citing recent increases in women bylines, saying parity was \"an important issue for us.\" But when prodded about insensitive edits, he denied them, adding: \"If a puzzlemaker is unhappy with our style of editing, then they should send their work elsewhere (or publish it themselves to keep complete control).\"\n\nInclusivity efforts need triangulation between insider and outsider tactics, angling for unity between the fix-the-system camp and the start-fresh camp. Many constructors I spoke with still submit to publications like the Times, while advocating elsewhere for puzzles that reflect younger, broader sensibilities.\n\nErik Agard is one such advocate. Recently named the editor of USA Today's crossword, in a few short months he's already \"brought something pretty radical,\" per Andy Kravis, a queer constructor and an assistant for the Times' puzzle. Almost every USA Today byline has been a woman or a person of color, thanks to Agard's active recruitment. \"It's a model people would talk about as 'Surely you can't mean this; [surely we'll] compromise along the way,'\" Kravis says, and yet, under Agard's stewardship, the USA Today puzzle is unmistakably diverse.\n\nPart of that diversity is procedural, the Millennial tendency to scrub hierarchy for collaboration. Agard has workshopped grids countless times with newer constructors, providing \"a level of support and mentorship that no other editor offers,\" says Rachel Fabi, a bioethicist and crossword constructor. \"The construction process [with Erik] is so much more efficient and respectful,\" another constructor, Stella Zawistowski, agreed, arguing that editors like Agard prove that collaboration need not be cumbersome or slow, and need not sacrifice author voice.\n\nRead: Down but not out: The uncertain future of the crossword puzzle\n\nSolvers have noticed. Agard, who once wore a PUBLISH MORE WOMEN shirt to a crossword-puzzle tournament, thinks Shortz and other legacy editors \"could snap [their] infinity gauntlets like Thanos, and 50 percent of puzzles would be by women.\" But for now Agard is focused on making puzzles for communities rarely represented in puzzles -- a project of expansion, not education. A solver lauded Agard for using they pronouns for the singer Sam Smith in a USA Today clue. Even cluing fusty crosswordese like OLE via the song \"Big Ole Freak\" wins converts and bridges generations; as one person observed on Twitter, \"Megan Thee Stallion was in my grandmother's crossword today.\"\n\nAnd while sensitive wunderkinds like Agard and David Steinberg, the Puzzles and Games editor at Andrews McMeel Universal, breathe new life into existing puzzles, publications old and new are getting into the crossword game. The New Yorker added a crossword in 2018; its editor, Liz Maynes-Aminzade, is the first woman to edit puzzles at a major publication since The New York Times' inaugural editor, Margaret Farrar. (Full disclosure: I'm a contributor to The New Yorker puzzle.) For Maynes-Aminzade, an inclusive puzzle demands both gender parity and, like at USA Today, a collaborative, transparent editorial process. Crucially, because codification in reference books and Wikipedia can lag behind popular usage of, say, queer or POC colloquialisms, a quick office poll in Slack -- as long as the group being surveyed is diverse -- can corroborate what a search-engine algorithm might undercount.\n\nOutside of traditional publications, subscription puzzle series such as the Inkubator, Women of Letters, and Queer Qrosswords make space for references or themes made for and by women and queer folks. Rebecca Falcon recently reviewed an Inkubator puzzle titled \"Take the Plunge,\" by Allegra Kuney. Its theme involved the letters B, O, O, and B extending beyond each side of the traditional 15x15 crossword grid; the terminal B of SPONGEBOB was, literally, part of a SIDE BOOB. Falcon's enthusiasm for the puzzle was more than admiration for a well-crafted crossword; she was lauding exactly the kind of playful theme you wouldn't see in most outlets, and the kind that might encourage a new crop of constructors.\n\nDoubly encouraging are role models, and Falcon has made waves there, too. While brainstorming a theme, she had the idea to call for a \"Women's March\" -- in this case, a month of puzzles with as many female crossword bylines as possible. After coordinating with various publications, and helping source new voices, Falcon estimates that more than 100 women-made crosswords will be published. The New York Times signed on for the first week (\"We're making progress,\" Shortz told me). Ben Tausig will feature women guest editors. And Steinberg will devote more than 30 puzzles to female bylines. Among the constructors will be Fabi and Zawistowski; Hoelscher, the Times constructor; and, making her Universal debut, Karen Steinberg, who happens to be David's mother. \"Yup, that's my mom!\" the younger Steinberg tweeted. \"I've been mentoring her!\"\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

People in America have fond memories of the Prelude, which is why finding out that it was a flop in Japan is so hard to imagine. What's even harder to wrap your head around is part of why: it had a \"pervert lever.\" Wait, what?\n\nYep, I said \"pervert lever.\" I'll admit I had absolutely no idea what the hell a pervert lever was or what the hell it had to do with the sweet, innocent Prelude until I saw this twitter thread from @chibitech called \"The Lewdness of the Honda Prelude.\" @Chibitech is based in Japan, and, as such, she's privy to an entirely different perception of the Prelude, one that was somehow entirely lost to us here in America.\n\nI'll embed her thread here, but I'll try and do some summarising as well. It's absolutely fascinating.\n\nThe Prelude's unpopularity was actually a bit more complex than just the pervert thing -- which I'll get to soon -- though that was a huge factor. The Prelude was always sort of a compromised car, a sporty car yet not a true sports car, a front-wheel-drive car that handled well and looked sporty, but would never really compete with similar-sized but more performance-oriented and upmarket cars like the Nissan Skyline coup\u00e9s, with their rear-wheel drive and much more genuine sports car handling and power.\n\nThe Prelude ended up being part of a new category of cars, sporty cars with sleek looks, lots of tech, but not necessarily stellar performance. Cars that were targeted at young men hoping to impress young ladies. These became known as \"Date Cars.\"\n\nOK, so, the Prelude was a Date Car, but so were cars like the Nissan Silvia and the Toyota Celica -- so why was it that the Prelude specifically earned such an unsavoury reputation?\n\nBecause of this:\n\nYes, that's just the seat reclining lever, used to adjust the seatback position so you can recline or flop the seat forward to get into the back seat. Normally, though, this is on the outer side of the seat, so it's accessible as the person enters the car. Here, the passenger's seat lever is on the inner side of the seat, meaning it's accessible most easily by the person in the driver's seat.\n\nThis is a puzzling place to put that lever, right? @Chibitech herself was confused as well, but unlike me, she was aware of the Japanese name for this lever:\n\n\"I was trying to figure a logical reason for this, and all I could think of is it lets the driver stay inside while they allow a passenger first access to the... tiny... back... seat? Japanese people weren't fooled though; they nicknamed it \u300c\u30b9\u30b1\u3079\u30ec\u30d0\u30fc\u300d, aka the 'Pervert Lever.'\"\n\nThe Pervert Lever.\n\nIt looks like it was also referred to, hilariously, as the \"horny knob,\" or skebenobu.\n\nWhile almost unknown here in America, it was absolutely A Thing in Japan, even being called out on televised news reports about the car, even as recently as last year. This report even went ahead and demonstrated how a Prelude-owning pervert would employ the Pervert Lever:\n\nYeah, that's pretty much how I figured it'd work.\n\nSo, this alarmingly-placed lever that allowed the driver to quickly and easily move his passenger from seated to prone and vulnerable absolutely cemented the Prelude's reputation as what we in America might call a Date Rapist's Car.\n\nIt's not like Japan, or even Honda, were particularly prudish about sex in cars; in fact, Honda marketed a small but roomy city car, the S-MX, with an ad campaign that made it pretty clear that it was a good car to get it on in.\n\nThe difference, though, is pretty clear: the S-MX was a car for consensual, horny people to get some time alone in, and the Prelude was for horny bastards to try to take advantage of women.\n\nIt's absolutely worth reading @Chibitech's full thread. I had no idea this existed, but as you can see, it's an incredible example of how a minor technical detail can have huge cultural repercussions that can completely make or break how successful a car is.\n\nHorny knob.\n\n(Thanks, Flexstyle on the internets!)\n\nThis article was originally published 14\/11\/19.","1147":"The Incredible Work of Molly Baber | Fstoppers Molly Baber is a multi-disciplinary visual artist and fashion photographer creating conceptual works that evoke blood, death, and feminine power, as well as a subconscious fantasy through ritual, divination, and mythology.\n\nCurrently based in Brighton, UK, she is inspired by the macabre, occult, and women's rituals. Baber is forever expanding her craft by assisting other photographers, working on film sets, collaborating with artists, and exhibiting personal works across the UK and Europe. In 2019, she was awarded \"Best Emerging Talent\" at the B3 BEN Awards at the Frankfurt Buchmesse, alongside co-collaborator Lena Chen, for their art film \"Expose Her.\" Her lens-based work focuses on artistic, emotive portraiture, storytelling, and natural forms. Since living in the rural countryside of Berlin, solo adventuring around the United States, and further expeditions around Europe, Asia, and Central America, she has been left with a passion for exploration, discovery, and connecting with fellow creatives.\n\nBaber started off her creative journey by using disposables as a kid; she had countless childhood photo albums, mainly consisting of her cats. She bought her first digital point and shoot camera when she was 13, which came with free editing software similar to Photoshop. Baber started doing photoshoots with friends, dressing up and painting themselves with abstract makeup. She was obsessed with America's Next Top Model and fashion magazines at the time, so her influences probably stemmed from that. She would watch retouching tutorial videos for fun and began editing the photos of her and her friends, as well as celebrity photos she found on the internet.\n\nBaber then used photography as part of her art classes at school and A-Level photography at sixth form college, where she did analog processes., falling in love with shooting still life, cemeteries, museum exhibit graves, taxidermy specimens, and skeletons on 35mm film. Baber would then develop and manipulate them in the darkroom. She says she had a fascination with the macabre and the transition between life and death from very early on in her artistic practice. Baber also studied A-Level Fine Art digital photography (mostly self-portraits) to create reference imagery for paintings. She would focus on dramatic and haunting portraiture, influenced by pop-surrealist artists such as Mark Ryden and Tom Bagshaw.\n\nIt wasn't until around 2014 that Baber started using models in her photography. A walk around a gloomy, misty lake at dusk gave her the urge to shoot there with a ghostly feminine figure, something she had never done before. The emotion and atmosphere that could be captured by adding a living person into the frame rather than skeletal remains excited her. From then on, she began frequently shooting with friends and local models in abandoned buildings, cemeteries, and fields. Photographers such as Emily Soto and Nona Limmen became Baber's most significant influences at this time and are still two of her favorite practitioners.\n\nIn 2015, Baber moved to Berlin and became immersed in a group of fine art photographers and models. She started a photography blog to document her experiences shooting models behind the scenes, assisting photographers, and a series of abandoned sites for the Urban Outfitters blog. As her love for travel grew, she became fascinated with landscape photography. She began mixing her love of darkness, gothic fashion, and rugged scenery. Baber became captivated by the feeling and story that haunting figures created within the fictional world. Eventually, in 2016, she applied to study for her BA (Honors) Fashion Photography at Falmouth University. It was here that Baber truly started to bring fashion into her work as she began to collaborate with designers and saw it as more of a career path.\n\nBaber's work has a very painterly feel to it. She believes this comes down to the lighting, makeup, and color toning in post-production. She uses Lightroom primarily for her color work but recently has been transitioning to Photoshop to gain more control. Baber also likes to play around with the use of prisms in-camera, which distort and fragments the photograph and also add to this painterly quality.\n\nAs well as photography, Baber has recently been working on a new film with her creative partner, Lena Chen. \"Expose Her\" tells the story of one woman's two identities, birthed from an experience of trauma, and the other lives she leads with different lovers. They exhibited the short film in a competition in which they won an award for the piece. Their overall goal is to turn it into a feature-length film. Baber and her creative partner are also working on a three-part conceptual fashion film series, retelling ancient rituals from a feminist perspective., the first of which, \"Starfire,\" has already been exhibited in cities. Baber plans to continue video as a storytelling medium, as the sequencing process is so different from a photo series. She is discovering that directing, editing, and color grading is something she loves and can't wait to pursue it further.\n\nBaber's inspiration works in different ways; sometimes, it's through collaboration, and other times, it's based on a theme she has a current obsession with (e.g., earth rituals, Victorian post-mortem photography, divination) or a personal experience that has struck her. Baber has an ongoing list of topics and ideas that she refers back to and adds to always. Baber looks online and in books, keeping notebooks and Google Docs of links, books, quotes, and conceptual thoughts and visual ideas. She refers to fashion magazines and other artists' work and makes mood boards for visual concepts. She then begins test shooting. Baber has also used discussion groups and interviews to conduct research. Most of the time, her projects are scattered with ideas at the beginning, and they become more focused as they progress. There is usually an epiphany moment when she realizes the message or story she wants to portray.\n\nAlways stick to your vision, but be aware that it may not be for everyone. Discover the art that excites you, visit museums and galleries, travel and explore places that intrigue you visually, and get inspired! Create for you.\n\nBaber says she is finding that staying true to her style, although it is a niche, is having its benefits, as those designers whose work she admires are approaching her to shoot for them.\n\nBaber has a new editing workflow. She makes her initial selects with Adobe Bridge and brings them into Lightroom to start experimenting with color and see which photos are grabbing her attention. Making various versions of her favorite selects and comparing them, she looks for differences in things like tone, saturation, and light and dark areas. Baber thinks the color grade is vital, and that part takes her the longest time. She mentions she can get quite indecisive, as the smallest change makes such a big difference to the overall mood of an image. Once she has made the final selection, she will then take the raw file into Photoshop to make any retouching adjustments and then either bring it back into Lightroom to add color adjustments or recreate and refine the color grade in Photoshop.\n\nOut of all her projects, one made a significant impact on her career so far. Baber feels the Tarot project still feels relevant to her. She started the series in 2018, and it kickstarted collaborating with other designers, stylists, and makeup artists. She originally made the series into a book; however, recently, she turned the series into postcards and brought them into a ritual setting, where she let people use them for divination purposes. Seeing them used in their intended way was a magical moment for Baber, and now, she is even more set on finishing the series and creating a full tarot deck.\n\n\"Minerva\" (2018), a film project in collaboration with artists Lena Chen and Erica Merritt, was also incredibly impactful for Baber. The concept came from alternative family models and utopian visions of raising children in the future. The process was a significant learning experience. She traveled to Berlin, Utrecht, and Stockholm to facilitate workshops and discussion groups with the public, conducted interviews, and filmed and edited the piece. The final work was a video projection installation, exhibited at Drone Dancing, F\u00e4rgfabriken, Stockholm. Baber performed on the opening night with Lena, something she had never done before, which has led to the planning of future performance work. There, they met Alex Weber, who became their sound designer for both the recent film projects \"Starfire\" and \"Expose Her.\" She also met her girlfriend during that exhibition. She has revisited Stockholm many times since and is even considering moving there. So, she says she has a lot to thank that project for.\n\nBaber has advice for anyone starting.\n\nYou don't have to focus on just one thing. I have bounced around multiple mediums, such as music and photography, and have always felt like I had to pick one to put all my time into and be successful in. I'm learning that creativity is an ever-evolving process, and it doesn't always mean sticking to one area.\n\nBaber sticks to this advice when she gets a creative block. She advises to switch to something else (e.g., painting, music, video), and photography will come back when the time is right.\n\nIn the future, Baber plans to continue with current work and concepts, the film projects and Tarot cards, as well as her most recent personal photography project, \"Unearth\" (2019), which discusses death, ritual, and mythology. Baber would love to immerse this project into the death positivity movement. She has also been involved with the Heal Her Project, a collective creating safe spaces for survivors of sexual trauma through transformative storytelling, collective ritual, and participatory art workshops. She has also been photographing Heal Her events across London and Germany and through the project will be ArtLake Festival this summer. She plans to create a Goddess series, photographing participants and workshop facilitators in an exercise in which they embody their inner goddess. Collaborating with makeup artists, stylists, and artists they have in the Heal Her team, participants will create their armor, accessories, and amulets and have the platform to become whoever they want to be. She also mentions she has also been collaborating with illustrators and graphic designers and would love to create more multimedia works in the future.\n\nIn 10 years' time, Baber hopes she will be surrounded by cats, a pup, and a studio full of witchy goodness and creating art with people who are passionate about what she wants to create. She would love nothing more than to be working with fashion brands, jewelry designers, magazines, and galleries, creating both video and photographic works. Baber also wants to team up with nonprofit organizations, creating art spaces and events for causes she is passionate about.\n\nAll images used with permission of Molly Baber.","1148":"The Irresistible Drama of Becoming Who You Want to Be Hirokazu Kore-eda's latest film, his first set outside of Japan, showcases the great director's signature theme.\n\nHirokazu Kore-eda's new film, The Truth, ends as many of his films do, with a group of people walking. Some of them are related; some are not. Some know exactly where they're going and why; others are just tagging along, enjoying the exercise and the company. The person who seems most determined, surest of what she's doing, is a septuagenarian movie star named Fabienne (Catherine Deneuve), in whose wake the others appear to follow. She's on her way to a film studio to reshoot an emotional scene that she feels she didn't get right the day before -- though everyone else thought it marvelous -- because her real life has intervened. The previous night, at the end of a long, cathartic heart-to-heart with her daughter, Lumir (Juliette Binoche), Fabienne suddenly sat up straight and blurted out, \"Why didn't I play it like this? Why didn't I think of it!\" And in that moment, this great French actor expresses the essential subject of this great Japanese director's art: people wondering how to play their lives, and why they can't seem to get it right the first time.\n\nKore-eda has been writing and directing gorgeous, slyly challenging dramatic features in his native Japan since the 1990s, winning awards at festivals all over the world without gaining much of a following among U.S. moviegoers. His profile has risen lately, since his 13th dramatic feature, Shoplifters, won the Palme d'Or at the 2018 Cannes festival and was nominated last year for an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. That wrenching movie, about a makeshift family living on the margins of society, didn't play in a lot of the big American multiplexes -- these days, almost no foreign films do.\n\nRead: 'Shoplifters' is a brilliant Dickensian tale for a modern age\n\nBut those who managed to see it in a theater or found it on Amazon or Hulu were moved by its vibrant lower-depths realism, its surprising humor, and what might be called its moral grace. Some viewers might have sought out his earlier work and discovered other, equally affecting family dramas such as Maborosi (1995), Nobody Knows (2004), Still Walking (2008), I Wish (2011), Our Little Sister (2015), and After the Storm (2016). The Truth, though it's set in France in a culturally rarefied milieu that Kore-eda has never shown the slightest interest in before, is very much of a piece with the movies he's made in his own land and language. He's not an artist who loses his identity when he's away from home.\n\nAnd that, I think, is because the idea of home and the twisty paradoxes of identity are the subjects he's been exploring for his entire career. At this strange moment in history, with so many people (voluntarily or not) far from home, and seemingly every nation in the grip of an identity crisis, Kore-eda's research could be of some use. Near the end of the beautiful After the Storm, a serious boy asks his father, \"Are you who you wanted to be?\" The dad, Ryota (Hiroshi Abe), who sees his son only once a month and has never been a paragon of responsibility, ruefully replies, \"I'm not who I want to be yet.\" (He's in his late 30s or thereabouts.) Then, after a thoughtful pause, he says, \"What matters is to live my life trying to become what I want to be.\"\n\nAs in all of Kore-eda's films, the simple statement's weight comes from the accumulation of ordinary moments that have preceded it. Through that quotidian stuff, the movie shows us exactly why Ryota says what he says to his son: He has a growing sense that he is helplessly turning into his own late and fiercely unreliable father; he's painfully conscious of his failure to write a second novel after a prizewinning first; and he's recently been shocked by his ex-wife's accusation that he only acts like a real father. He does, as it happens, love the boy, and now, approaching middle age, he wants to become the part he's been playing. And in the world of Kore-eda's films, a tried-on identity can, over time, turn into the genuine article. Actors know that. So do children when they're playing -- pretending hard, as if they could imagine themselves into what they want to be. Becoming who you're going to be begins, for all of us, as play but ends as work: doing take after take after take until it feels right, feels like yourself.\n\nChildren are often right at the center of Kore-eda's dramatic films, and usually, like Ryota's pensive son, they're trying furiously to figure out the peculiar worlds they live in, and what roles they'll need to play to survive in them. In I Wish, which is Kore-eda's funniest movie, a pair of brothers perform some pretty strenuous magical thinking in an attempt to reunite their divorced parents. In Nobody Knows, which is his saddest, four siblings abandoned by their mother do their best to act like a real, intact family, with the eldest -- 12-year-old Akira -- assuming the role of father. They're even further off the grid than the ragtag aggregation of Shoplifters, yet they make of their grim situation, for a while, a reasonable facsimile of normality.\n\nRead: Unraveling the Oscars' foreign-language-film debate\n\nKore-eda doesn't romanticize childhood as Wordsworth did, but he clearly sees it as a crucial time, as a sort of laboratory of identity. He respects children, not out of some reverence for their innocence, or because they are -- as speechmakers never tire of reminding us -- \"our future,\" but because they're interesting. That's why he's the best director of kids since Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut; he understands that they're natural actors, that making believe is what they do and how they grow.\n\nThat growth is a slow process, of course. But Kore\u2011eda is fascinated by process, and he has no problem with slow. The rhythms of his films are more deliberate than many viewers are accustomed to. (He's the sole credited editor on all his dramatic films save his first, Maborosi.) There's a lot of walking around in his pictures; a good deal of talking about, preparing, and eating food; and a pervasive low-level sense of expectation -- of people waiting for something, keeping alert for it as they go through their daily routines. Kore-eda, who started out making documentaries for Japanese television, watches and waits along with his characters, strolling with them, taking his sweet time.\n\nThen, when time is running out, his people get a little desperate. While the kids play, the grown-ups brood and fret, and those nearing the end of life grow melancholy or bitter. The elderly parents in Still Walking are fearsomely unpleasant: the father grumpy and unyielding, the mother a monster of passive-aggression. Fabienne, in The Truth, is a world-class passive-aggressor too. For all her success, she is a restless, unhappy woman. She can't help giving everyone around her -- her daughter, her son-in-law (Ethan Hawke), her staff, the film crew -- the feeling that somehow they're letting her down. Her tea, whoever serves it, is never the right temperature.\n\nRyota's widowed mother, in After the Storm, is kinder, more self-effacing, but prone to attacks of ruefulness. At one point late in the film, as her son, grandson, and former daughter-in-law take shelter in her apartment from a howling typhoon, she muses quietly, \"I really just can't understand why things turned out like this.\" You feel, in that heartbreaking moment, her deep sense of too-lateness, her regret that few discoveries about her life or herself are left to be made.\n\nFor Kore-eda, the direst affliction a human being can have is the feeling that one's identity is settled, that the rest of the story is simply unspooling, of its own momentum, toward an inevitable ending. That's like living in a state of permanent denouement. As a storyteller, Kore-eda doesn't traffic much in denouements or, for that matter, climaxes. What he cares about is how we move a little farther toward ourselves, take a few more halting steps forward. In the whimsical After Life (1998), he even allows himself to fantasize that the process goes on, at least for a while, after death. In that film, the newly deceased are required, as a condition of admission to heaven, to select a single memory from their earthly lives to hold on to for eternity. Naturally, he's interested not in heaven per se, but in how the dead might imagine an afterlife of their own choosing, a story of who they were when they were most themselves.\n\nFrom July\/August 2015: Terrence Rafferty on the decline of the American actor\n\nIn his 1996 documentary, Without Memory, Kore\u2011eda tells the story of a man named Hiroshi Sekine who has a neurological condition called Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome and is unable to retain the memories of recent experiences. He can remember his life prior to the onset of the disorder, but next to nothing of what he did a day or even an hour before. \"If I'm really here, inside this flow of time,\" Sekine says, \"if I really exist or not, I just don't know.\" Everything is new to him, all the time. His life is a perpetual reinvention. He's an extreme case, in other words, of the qualities that draw Kore-eda to children and, in his latest film, to actors -- to those dedicated to the constant reimagining of experience, to endless revisions of the self. The trick, for his fictional characters, is to do what the real-life subject of Without Memory cannot: to find a sense of continuity in the chaos.\n\nHis movies don't presume to tell us how to do that trick -- only that it has to be done, somehow. A lovely moment arrives near the end of The Truth when Fabienne's little granddaughter, Charlotte (Cl\u00e9mentine Grenier), tells her grandma quite earnestly that she'd like to be an actress too, when she grows up. Fabienne is visibly moved by this demonstration of generational continuity, which apparently skipped her daughter (who was \"lousy\" in her school play, and became a writer instead). She might be even more pleased to know, as the audience learns soon after, that Charlotte is already an actress: The child was playing a scene scripted for her by her mother, and playing it to perfection.\n\n\"True\" or not, Charlotte's declaration seems to do Fabienne a world of good. It puts a spring in her step as she marches with her entourage to reshoot her own scene. This filmmaker constructs his stories so that they arrive not at a clear resolution but at witty, paradoxical moments like this one. He never leaves us unsatisfied, though. For those of us who are trying to understand why things turned out like this -- most of the current human residents of Earth, these days -- Kore-eda offers, as he always has, sound advice: Keep imagining, keep playing, and, most of all, keep walking.\n\nThis article appears in the April 2020 print edition with the headline \"The Reigning Master of Family Drama.\"\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

But it wasn't the horse that went on to prove himself the greatest in the race's history that made this particular running of the National so memorable as that of the performance of the runner-up Crisp.\n\nThe fences were an awful lot tougher back in the mid-1970s than they are today and yet Crisp treated them with utter disdain. He was carrying 12st, a weight forbidden in the National now, but failed by only three-quarters of a length to beat a horse who was carrying a featherweight and who would subsequently romp home twice under crushing burdens that no other runner has come close to emulating in the 30-odd years since. Crisp was so far clear even four fences out that defeat seemed unimaginable but he was a champion racehorse at the minimum distance of two miles and the National is four-and-a-half.\n\nThe giant horse's stamina started to give out but though Red Rum was only five lengths down at the last, he still only got his head in front two strides from the line. \"Red Rum's beginning to get up ... he's beginning to get up,\" bellowed Peter O'Sullevan, as Crisp rolled around on the run-in like a drunk trying to find his way out of the pub. The third horse, L'Escargot, a dual Gold Cup winner who subsequently won the National in 1975, was 25 lengths adrift at the finish. I was 12 in 1973 and my gran had put my first ever bet on for me. I had backed Red Rum and was ecstatic. Every time I watch the re-run now I want Red Rum to blunder; for Crisp not to hit the final fence as he did; for his jockey, Richard Pitman, to steer him in a straight line in the closing stages. Anything to enable him to hang on and spare us the agonising last few yards. TP\n\n2) Devon Loch collapses, 1956\n\nHe jumped all 30 fences but he couldn't make it up the run-in. In what may be the most dramatic example of sporting defeat snatched from the jaws of victory, Devon Loch belly-flopped to the turf with the winning post just yards away, handing victory to ESB, who had been trailing him by three lengths. His failure at least gave the Queen Mother, his owner, the chance to appear gracious in defeat. \"That's racing,\" she told those who offered their sympathies.\n\nDick Francis, Devon Loch's jockey, couldn't quite match that level of poise, reportedly bursting into tears when the crowd applauded him as he walked back to the grandstand. A kinder fate awaited him as a result of the race; he was asked to write his autobiography, which he followed with a string of bestselling novels that made him rich. Explanations abound for what happened. Devon Loch may have got cramp, been shocked by crowd noise or seen the water jump out of the corner of his eye. In contrast to Francis's books, there was to be no tidy resolution. CC\n\n3) The field folds for Foinavon, 1967\n\nThe horse that was so slow, they named a fence after him. Even now, 42 years on, Foinavon remains the definitive proof that anything can happen in the National. Foinavon's first owner was Anne, Duchess of Westminster, who named him after a mountain, just like another of her horses, one called Arkle. There, the similarities ended. Foinavon was a 100-1 shot when he lined up for the National, and his owner, John Kempton, had decided to go to Worcester instead.\n\nJohn Buckingham took over as his jockey when his regular pilot could not make the weight, but they were tailed off and coming home in his own time as the field approached the 23rd fence, the one after Becher's, on the second circuit. It was here that chaos ensued, when the riderless Popham Down veered straight across the fence without jumping it. Those in behind panicked and slowed down, and for 10 seconds, horses were falling or refusing so rapidly that Michael O'Hehir, the BBC commentator, could barely keep up. Foinavon, so far detached that Buckingham could take evasive action, was the only horse to jump the fence first time. Seventeen more, including Josh Gifford on Honey End, the favourite, remounted and set off after Foinavon, but this horse had - by his standards, at least - bolted. GW\n\n4) Last Suspect prevails for Forster, 1985\n\nThe third Grand National winner trained by that eternal pessimist, the late, great Captain Tim Forster, Last Suspect started at 50-1 following a track record that revealed as much temperament as ability. Not for the first time, though, Aintree galvanised a \"thinker'' like Last Suspect and, despite swishing his tail almost continuously, he came out of the clouds with a withering run to collar Mr Snugfit and record a memorable victory in the colours of Anne, Duchess Of Westminster, made famous by Arkle.\n\nIt was a win which underlined the skills of Forster, one of the old-school jumps trainers whose like will never be seen again. Winning jockey Hywel Davies, meanwhile, was lucky to be at Aintree at all, having been at death's door in a crashing fall months earlier. Last Suspect was a one-off, in the best tradition of Grand National winners. RC\n\n5) Hats off to Red Rum, 1977\n\nIt is easy to forget now that back in the mid-1970s, the Grand National appeared to be on its last legs. Every running was billed as \"possibly the last\" as Bill Davies, a property developer, threatened to dig up the track's vast acreage for housing. It was the greatest National horse of them all who helped to focus the public's attention on the threat. His unprecedented third success, having finished second twice too, was a moment of such joy and emotion that it galvanised the effort to save the National, though it was not finally secure for another six years.\n\nThe race itself was relatively uneventful. Red Rum was clearly going best from some way out. The only danger was a fall, and since he had already jumped around Aintree four times without touching a twig, that was not too realistic either.\n\nAfter the last, it was a procession, memorably described by Peter O'Sullevan in words that can still glisten the eye. \"He's getting the most tremendous cheer from the crowd. They're willing him home now. The 12-year-old Red Rum, being preceded only by loose horses, being chased by Churchtown Boy. They're coming to The Elbow. There's a furlong between Red Rum and his third Grand National triumph. And he's coming up to the line to win it like a fresh horse in great style. It's hats off and a tremendous reception - you've never heard one like it at Liverpool.\" GW\n\n6) Corbiere's landmark win, 1983\n\nJenny Pitman's Corbiere goes down in Aintree history as the first National winner to be trained by a woman, but what should not be overlooked was the brilliant round of jumping which brought about that landmark victory. Crisp, quite rightly, is remembered for the manner in which he jumped the fences in 1973, but you won't see many better rounds of jumping in the National than Corbiere under Ben de Haan.\n\nAn eight-year-old, and there haven't been too many National winners of that age in the modern era, carrying 11st4lb, Corbiere had won the Welsh National earlier in the season. He looked high enough in the weights, but barely touched a twig en route to beating Ireland's Greasepaint. Corbiere went on to run in the race on four more occasions, finishing third in 1984 and 1985. RC","1150":"The Joy of Six: public apologies | Barry Glendenning 1) Lance Armstrong apologises to Oprah\n\nTo err is human, to forgive is divine: athlete messes up, then fronts up before the media to express contrition and ask for mercy. In a world where even the most nimble feet are often made from metaphorical clay, the public apology has long been a sporting staple. Many are utterly sincere, others not so much. Some are forced, quite a few are unnecessary. Then there's the vague non-apology, where - through gritted teeth - a sportsman or woman who clearly feels they've done little wrong apologises to anyone \"if\" they were offended. One of many, a personal favourite came in 2013 from cyclist Peter Sagan, who famously issued one notable classic of the genre, when after publicly goosing podium girl Maja Leye in the wake of the Tour of Flanders, he tweeted that it \"was not my intention to disrespect women today on the podium. Just a joke, sorry if someone was disturbed about it.\" Splendid.\n\nMastering the mea culpa can be tricky and for all his drug-assisted success as a cyclist, Sagan's one-time colleague Lance Armstrong has yet to get the hang of it. Having been railroaded into admitting his guilt and role as ringleader in the most sophisticated drugs operation in cycling history, the disgraced seven-times Tour de France winner agreed to prostrate himself before his public in an eagerly anticipated and pre-recorded televised interview with noted cycling enthusiast and take-no-prisoners interrogator Oprah Winfrey.\n\nWe've all seen it by now. Finally owning up to having cheated his way to victory in a lengthy exchange that prompted almost as many new questions as answers, the Texan looked uncharacteristically uncomfortable as he confessed to much, if not all of the skulduggery that had enabled him to pedal his way to glory in Paris on all seven occasions, while steadfastly refusing to implicate any of those who had helped him along the way.\n\nHis battle against cancer and good works for charity were mentioned regularly, while in keeping with his persona as the bully he admitted to being, it was notable that at times, despite his best efforts, Armstrong just couldn't stop himself sneering and smirking his way through an apology that occasionally seemed heartfelt, but more often than not suggested he was really sorry for himself, his dwindling bank balance and his rotten luck in getting caught.\n\n2) Phil Taylor apologises to Raymond van Barneveld\n\nFor all his undisputed excellence and indefatigability as a sportsman, 16-times world darts champion Phil Taylor can sometimes be difficult to admire. Occasionally more spiky in victory than other players are in defeat, his occasional habit of patronising opponents and interviewers can be wearing, although it should be noted that he could scarcely have been more magnanimous in defeat during his press conference following his most recent World Championship reverse at the hands of Gary Anderson. It was in stark contrast to his reaction at the end of his semi-final victory over Raymond van Barneveld in the same competition late in 2012.\n\nHaving hit double 16 to win the match and put an end to a thrilling comeback by his close friend and rival, Taylor was suitably delighted and celebrated in front of a crowd that had rowed in behind the Dutchman as he clawed his way back into the match from 5-1 down to make it 5-4. As Barney took his hand to shake it, Taylor was happy to accept the congratulations, but his pleasure turned to indignation and then outright irritation as Barney continued shaking, yanking him backwards as he refused to let go of his hand, before throwing a congratulatory arm around his shoulder. Ducking out of the embrace, Taylor proceeded to tell Barney to \"fuck off\", then subjected his vanquished and clearly bewildered opponent to another torrent of abuse as they left the stage. Another conciliatory gesture from Barney was rejected and Taylor walked off alone, effing and jeffing as Barney was restrained from following him by match officials. It was all quite baffling. The following morning, Taylor couldn't have been more contrite.\n\n\"Well, I'm a bit gutted about what happened at the end, obviously,\" he said in an interview with Sky Sports News. \"Trying to put the record straight, Raymond is a big lad. I don't feel too well and he just hurt me a bit when he was squeezing me hand and pulling me around the neck. I reacted wrongly, it was disgraceful really and I can only apologise for that. Obviously it will never happen again. He just hurt me a bit so I told him 'stop it' and I swore at him ... ugh.\" At this point Taylor rubbed his face, in a bid to hide his shame, his obvious embarrassment evident for all to see.\n\n\"I've spoken to Raymond this morning and I'm gutted, obviously,\" he continued. \"It's playing on my mind, it's upset a lot of people ... I don't know what to do about it really. At the minute I could just walk away tomorrow night and just retire ... go out on top really. I'm a bit disillusioned about everything at the minute. Obviously I don't feel very well so really I need a break. To be honest I don't care about the darts at the minute. I know I'm in the final but I don't feel excited, I don't feel chuffed about being in the final ... I feel very, very down at the minute.\"\n\nTaylor emerged from his slough of despair to beat Michael van Gerwen 7-4 in the following day's final, his 16th and most recent victory in a tournament he shows no sign of abandoning. Having been one of just a handful of players to offer Van Barneveld support when he was the victim of a Dutch blackmailer in 2010, Taylor was not about to be cut loose by his old pal. \"We go back a long way, and I don't want to spoil many years of friendship over a split-second reaction after a tense world championship semi-final,\" said Barney, who claimed to be mystified by what it was exactly he had done to send Taylor into such a bizarre tantrum.\n\n3) Eric Cantona apologises to an imaginary prostitute\n\nFollowing the tsunami of moral outrage prompted by his assault on Crystal Palace fan Matthew Simmons in January 1995, Eric Cantona didn't so much have the book thrown at him as the entire contents of the British Library. As well as being convicted of assault and receiving a two-week jail sentence that was later overturned and reduced (or increased, depending on your point of view) to 120 hours' community service, the French striker was stripped of the French captaincy and handed a four-month ban and \u00a320,000 fine by his club at the behest of the Football Association. Inevitably, he was also summoned to a hearing at the headquarters of the FA, whose chairman Graham Kelly described an attack many fans found genuinely hilarious as \"a stain on our game\".\n\nTruth be told, Cantona didn't do himself too many favours, as the then FA chief executive David Davies would later recall in his memoirs. Standing before FA blazers Geoff Thompson, Ian Stott and Gordon McKeag, the normally recalcitrant player appeared to be on his best behaviour and his exercise in contrition was going well. It began with an apology to the commission, then apologies to Manchester United, his lawyer Maurice Watkins and boss Alex Ferguson. So far, so humble. \"I like to apologise to my team-mates. I want to apologise to the FA,\" he continued, showing what appeared to be genuine remorse. And finally? According to Davies, Cantona finished up by saying: \"And I would like to apologise to the prostitute who shared my bed last night.\" To the sound of jaws hitting the floor and the great surprise of nobody, his ban was doubled and he was fined an extra \u00a310,000.\n\n4) Joey Porter apologises to everyone except Kellen Winslow\n\nFollowing a midweek win over the Cleveland Browns in December 2006, Pittsburgh Steelers linebacker Joey Porter found himself in hot water after ridiculing the vanquished side and subjecting their tight end Kellen Winslow to some off-colour homophobic abuse. In a post-game interview, Porter labelled his opponent a \"fag\", adding that Winslow had \"tried to dap me up [shake hands] before the game. He's soft though, I don't pay attention to him.\"\n\nPorter's outburst was not over the Cleveland man's attempted friendly greeting before the game, but in response to what he perceived to be a late hit on a team-mate perpetrated during proceedings, which seemed a bit rich coming from a man who, three years later while playing for the Miami Dolphins, would be voted the joint-second dirtiest defensive player in the league by 296 of his peers.\n\n\"It was late,\" said Porter of the tackle. \"That's what fags do. He's soft. He wanna be tough but he's really soft. He tried to give me a handshake before the game. He's not my friend. He don't know me. What you trying to shake my hand for? He talks too much and he hadn't done nothing. He threw a cheap shot. He's weak. He's for real weak. He's soft. He might want to play receiver because he don't want to play tight end. He's not gonna block anybody.\"\n\nThe following week, Porter issued an apology ... of sorts. In a classic of the non-apology apology genre, he said sorry to anybody who had been offended by his remarks, explaining that he had only meant to insult the player at whom they had been aimed. \"You know, that was probably a poor choice of words,\" he said. \"So if I offended anybody, I apologise for that ... I don't know ... I guess because how we used that word freely, me growing up using that word, I didn't think anything of it. Like I said, I apologise to anyone I may have offended. I didn't mean to offend anybody but Kellen Winslow.\"\n\nSo that's alright, then, although if nothing else you can't help but admire the man's candour. The NFL were less impressed and fined Porter $10,000 for what they called \"vulgar, inexcusable statements\". Three months earlier, Porter had been forced to issue a more sincere and unreserved apology, when two of his dogs - a pit bull and a mastiff - escaped from his garden and killed a miniature horse at a neighbouring property. \"I have reached out to the owners of the horse and will do whatever I can to help them get through this very unfortunate situation,\" he said. It was an unfortunate situation he was forced to help another neighbour \"get through\" while playing for the Arizona Cardinals in 2011. On this occasion, according to the Bakersfield Californian, four of his dogs savaged and killed a luckless hound.\n\n5) Andrew Flintoff apologises to England cricket fans\n\nAndrew Flintoff seems to have spent much of his cricket career apologising for assorted indiscretions, even if his occasional forays into the world of amiable, often drink-fuelled buffoonery have served only to further endear him to those who like their sporting heroes served up with generous dollops of human failing. Just this week, the former England all-rounder tweeted an apology to viewers of Ten Sport TV in Australia, after a stump microphone caught him castigating himself in the strongest possible terms after missing a shot while batting for the Brisbane Heat in the Big Bash. Like many of the likable all-rounder's gaffes, it was no big deal, but in a world where taking offence appears to have become a popular pastime, it's probably better to be safe than sorry.\n\nFlintoff's most famous apology came in 2007, when after a night on the lash with some team-mates in St Lucia in the wake of a Cricket World Cup defeat at the hands of New Zealand, he decided it would be a good idea to join Ian Botham for a nightcap. Flintoff was walking along the beach at the time and believed the Sky Sports pundit to be attending a soiree on an unspecified boat moored further out at sea.\n\n\"I thought: 'I can't swim ... that would be dangerous,' so I was going to get a kayak,\" Flintoff would later tell Piers Morgan in an episode of Life Stories. \"I couldn't find the oars, so I dragged this pedalo into the water. The next morning I woke up, I was on my bed and ... still wet and ... sand between my toes.\" Oops.\n\nReports vary on what exactly happened between the moment Flintoff dragged his vessel into the water and woke up in his hotel room, not least because there seems to be a very good chance he doesn't actually remember. While he insists he never actually set sail, the general consensus appears to be that at some point he fell out or off of it and had to be rescued and helped ashore. Whatever happened, the metaphorical fallout was spectacular: the still bedraggled Flintoff was summoned to the hotel room of England coach Duncan Fletcher, stripped of the England vice-captaincy, dropped for England's next game and subsequently forced to explain himself to members of a press pack who almost certainly couldn't believe their luck.\n\n\"I'm embarrassed and ashamed,\" announced a chastened Flintoff, who looked genuinely contrite. \"It shouldn't have happened. There's no secret we had a few drinks on Friday. It's been documented in the press what happened afterwards with a little bit of poetic licence. There was water involved and a pedalo as well. But I don't want to go into detail. I don't think my life was in danger.\"\n\nDuring his long walk of shame across the hotel lobby into the press conference, Flintoff admitted that he was unable to make eye contact with England fans \"who were only months previously cheering my name and high-fiving me\" but were now \"shaking their heads\". A few minutes later, on the return journey, the same supporters greeted him with loud applause.\n\n6) Tiger Woods apologises to a hand-picked audience\n\nWhen it emerged in 2010 that Tiger Woods had spent years philandering with a bevy of cocktail waitresses, porn stars and assorted other cliches behind the back of his wife Elin Nordegren, the golfer laid low for a couple of months before attempting to pitch his way out of the bunker of shame in which he'd found himself with his sand wedge of regret.\n\nIn front of a carefully hand-picked gathering made up of sympathetic press, friends, business associates and his mother, among others, the golfer proceeded to apologise for everything while admitting very little in a televised mea culpa that lasted almost 10 minutes and pointedly referenced his many good works for charity before concluding with one of his all-too-regular broadsides at the media for bothering his family.\n\nQuite why Woods felt the need to apologise to so many people for something that was absolutely none of their concern remains unclear, although he did offer a clue. \"As Elin pointed out to me, my real apology to her will not come in the form of words,\" he said. He wasn't wrong; it came in the form of a divorce settlement estimated in some quarters to be as much as $750m.","1151":"The Joy of Six: three-goal comebacks | Scott Murray 1) SOUTHAMPTON 3-3 Liverpool (Premiership, 2000)\n\nCrystanbul was nothing new; Liverpool are past masters of the three-goal comeback. Whether provocateurs or patsies, they've been involved in some of the great turnarounds of the modern age, a narrative device revisited to the point where it's something of a clich\u00e9. The entire dramatic seam has been mined. May's meltdown at the tail end of last season's title race quickly became, thanks to some grade-A punning, the perfect companion piece to the miracle of Istanbul back in 2005. No need to tell either story again. Polar opposites, beautifully crafted bookends, take your pick, there's something there for everyone.\n\nLiverpool's first great three-goal comeback of the modern era was performed in January 1994, against Manchester United at Anfield. United needed only 23 minutes to storm into a three-goal lead, Steve Bruce, Ryan Giggs and Denis Irwin the scorers. Liverpool took another 15 minutes to claw their way right back into it, Nigel Clough twice threading home from exploratory range. Neil Ruddock nutted the equaliser with 11 minutes to go, wheeling away in pain rather than celebration, clutching his big, brave, confused face. After the match, a livid Alex Ferguson sacked Peter Schmeichel after a full and frank exchange of views during which the keeper was blamed for the capitulation, on account of his goal kicks repeatedly flying straight to Ruddock. Fergie eventually simmered down, perhaps upon realising his team were still 21 points ahead of Liverpool in the league, heading inexorably for another title.\n\nPyrrhic for Liverpool, who suddenly realised their new underdog role in the scheme of things, but at least they had a little fun. There wasn't so much to be found when they hauled back Basel in the 2002\/03 Champions League. Gerard Houllier's side needed a victory to make it through the groups, but capitulated woefully in the first half, falling 3-0 behind within 29 minutes. A young Steven Gerrard was hooked at half time, and Liverpool mounted a staunch comeback. Quickfire goals from Danny Murphy and Vladimir Smicer gave them hope, but despite Michael Owen's 84th-minute equaliser, Liverpool were out. Basel went through instead.\n\nShipping three-goal leads, then, need not be totally injurious to one's health. So here's Liverpool at the Dell in the third game of the 2000-01 season, three goals to the good against Southampton after an hour, with Owen in his youthful pomp. Enter ageing Saints genius and morning McDonald's customer Matt Le Tissier, who made up for a muffin-muncher's mobility with good old-fashioned speed of thought. His teasing crosses and corners were too much for Liverpool's supposedly parsimonious defence, Jamie Carragher all over the shop at left back. \"Latvia's Michael Owen\", the diminutive Marian Pahars, scored an easy header on 73 minutes, Tahar El Khalej added a second with a clever back header on 85, and Pahars forced home the equaliser in injury time. Houllier was \"very angry\", though refrained from sacking Sander Westerveld on the spot, Fergie style. That move was another 12 months down the line.\n\nBut you could argue the collapse did Liverpool a favour in the long run. They were only three games into the new season, but very fragile of mind after a decade of misery in the league, so there was already a sense that they'd made a fatal error in gifting early, vital ground to Arsenal, Manchester United and Leeds. Oh well, perhaps it'll be best to put most effort into the cups.\n\n2) Swindon Town 4-3 LEICESTER CITY (First Division play-off final, 1993)\n\nAh hold on, here's another Liverpool match featuring a three-goal comeback: the second, less-famous, 4-3 with Newcastle United, in March 1997. Newcastle came to Anfield looking to avenge their painful loss there in April 1996, the to-and-fro classic which had gone a long way to costing them a first title in nearly 70 years. But they made a proper pig's lug of it. In a staggeringly one-sided first half, Jamie Redknapp ran the show in arguably his best-ever performance for Liverpool, his exquisite through ball sending Robbie Fowler away to make it 3-0 just before half time. An irate young Newcastle fan sauntered up to the visitors dug-out and whistled his black-and-white shirt into manager Kenny Dalglish's mush. No way to treat a king.\n\nFor the second half, Dalglish flung on David Ginola, and Newcastle threw caution to the wind. Much good it did them, mind, as they continued to sputter along without causing Liverpool too much bother. But David James was never really on his game during his years on Merseyside, and so there was always hope for the opposition. He fumbled a weak Keith Gillespie speculator into the net with 19 minutes to go, then with four minutes left Faustino Asprilla lobbed him. Two more minutes had elapsed when Warren Barton rammed home after James had half-parried an Asprilla snapsnot. The majority of the Anfield crowd, stunned, cursed their presumption, as did the kid who had earlier thrown away his top.\n\nBut once again Newcastle hearts would be broken in injury time at the Kop end, Stig Inge Bjornebye crossing from the left for Robbie Fowler to head home. This time the celebrations, which had been joyfully manic in 1996 when Stan Collymore lashed home, were mainly the product of relief. \"To have to score in the last minute after the way we played was ridiculous,\" sighed Roy Evans. The visitors were just as downhearted. \"The best that can be said about Newcastle,\" observed our man, the legendary David Lacey, \"is that having threatened for most of the evening to lose in the passive mood adopted by Dalglish, they ended up going down more in the cavalier spirit of Kevin Keegan.\"\n\nA proper study in futility, that one. But we can't be picking on Liverpool's habit of shipping three-goal leads yet again, so here's another example of the futile three-goal comeback. It's the best second-tier play-off final in history, the easy-on-the-eye 1993 affair between Glenn Hoddle's Swindon Town and Brian Little's Leicester City. It was one of those wonderful occasions where both teams went at it with a great passion; listen to co-commentator David Pleat's excitable giggle when Nicky Summerbee nearly reduced all the Wembley hoardings to splinters, a common-or-garden tap into touch restyled as a nuclear missile launch, only with added force and provocation. Lovely! This was on from the off.\n\nThe first 45 minutes were fun but relatively subdued. Close to half time, Leicester could have taken the lead through David Oldfield, shooting on the turn towards the bottom left corner. Swindon flooded upfield and actually did, Craig Maskell guiding a clever backheel into his manager's path, Hoddle blootering home from the edge of the box. And then after the break, all manner of lunacy. Maskell got one himself with an unstoppable lash across Kevin Poole, then Shaun Taylor headed home on 53 minutes amid confusion in the Leicester box. Swindon were surely in the Premier League.\n\nNot yet, not quite yet. With just over an hour to go, Steve Walsh planted a header on the right-hand post, and Julian Joachim thrashed the rebound home. It suddenly felt back on, with Swindon visibly starting to panic. Which raises the question: why do three-goal comebacks not happen more often? What initially looks like a consolation goal at 3-1 can so easily, to borrow a phrase from 2005 Champions League final commentator Clive Tyldesley, put a grain of doubt in the back of the opposition's mind. It only then takes another for the alarm bells to ring and the knees to rattle.\n\nSo to borrow another Tyldesleyism from that night in Istanbul: hello, hello, here we go. On 68 minutes, Walsh headed past a flapping Fraser Digby. Swindon lost the collective noggin. A mere 60 seconds later, Mike Whitlow drove into a cavernous gap down the inside-left channel and slipped the ball inside for Steve Thompson, who took a calm touch to sashay into the box before flicking an insouciant effort into the bottom right! A picturebook goal to celebrate one of the great comebacks in English football history, all completed within 12 breathless minutes.\n\nBut it was all for naught. Kevin Poole tapped Steve White on the shoulder with six minutes to go, allowing David Elleray to award the softest of penalties. Paul Bodin calmly slotted away the penalty - this was six months before his career-defining miss from 12 yards for Wales against Romania in the World Cup qualifiers - and Swindon were up, after all. Well done, Paul! At this point, Leicester still hadn't won a game at Wembley in six attempts, counting four FA Cup finals and the previous year's play-off final. However, they'd only need another 12 months to break that particular duck, third time lucky in a play-off triptych. Wales, meanwhile, are still waiting for their second World Cup appearance. Oh Paul!\n\n3) Burkina Faso 4-4 DR CONGO (Africa Cup of Nations, third-place final, 1998)\n\nSo what constitutes a three-goal comeback? Coming back from three goals down to earn a draw, obviously. Ask Luis. But what about winning after giving someone that 0-3 head start? You need four goals for that. But you're coming back from \"three\" down. The number three's doing an awful lot of work there. Similar logic could be applied to a turnaround from 0-2 for a 3-2 win, of course, three goals required and all, but that's opening up a whole new can of worms. And while the only thing we're sure about is that there's huge gaps in our thinking, the bottom line is, our gaff, our rules. So here it is: you fall three goals behind, then you either win, draw or lose. You can like that definition, or bury your head in your shirt and sob uncontrollably. Up to you.\n\nSo four-goal comebacks - such as Charlton Athletic's against Huddersfield Town in 1957, or QPR's against Newcastle United in 1984 - don't fall within our remit today, though you can at least read about them here. (What do you mean, we're running out of ideas?) That four-goal rule does for Mali as well, who went into the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations as one of the hipsters' choices, played appallingly in their opening match for 79 minutes against hosts Angola to go 4-0 down, and then staged a wholly improbable comeback to grab a 4-4 draw. It's worth reading our man Tom Lutz's typically pitch-perfect MBM of that one. (88 min: 4-2. \"Too late? Yep.\" 90+3 min: 4-3: \"Too late? Yep-ish.\" 90+4 min: 4-4: \"Eh?\")\n\nBut perhaps that's not as good as the 1998 third-place play-off anyway. This one saw gun-for-hire coach Phillipe Troussier's luck run out in spectacular style. At the start of the decade, he'd earned himself the nickname The White Witchdoctor while managing ASEC Mimosas of Ivory Coast, having made a double substitution in a game while trailing 2-0 with two minutes to go; ASEC won 3-2 and then embarked on a winning run which culminated in the club's first title for 10 years. He nearly took Ivory Coast to the 1994 World Cup, and helped Nigeria to qualify for France 98, before walking out over money. He then agreed to coach South Africa in France, but while waiting for the Coupe du Monde, a football itch needed to be scratched. So he took over tiny Burkina Faso, who were hosting the 1998 Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nBingo! Amid delirious scenes, he rode the Stallions to the semi-finals, by far their best performance in the competition at the time. They finished in a highly respectable fourth place - yet it should have been so much better. They were 3-0 up in the third-place play-off against DR Congo with 14 minutes to go. The Congolese pulled one back, but the hosts restored their three-goal advantage with four minutes left. A done deal at 4-1, surely? Sure enough, Congo rattled in three goals in the remaining time, then ended up winning on penalties by the symbolically sickening score of, yes, 4-1. So much for Troussier's witch-doctor skillset, though he did go on to lead South Africa to semi-respectability in France, and Japan to the second round at their own World Cup four years later.\n\n4 MIDDLESBROUGH 4-1 Basel (Uefa Cup semi-final, second leg, 2006) And 5) MIDDLESBROUGH 4-2 Steaua Bucharest (Uefa Cup semi-final, second leg, 2006)\n\nSteve McClaren won the Dutch league in 2010 with Twente Enschede, and right now looks like taking Derby County back to the Premier League. Hats off! Yet he's still defined in this country by his failure to lead his countrymen to Euro 2008. Brollies up! Hardly a surprise, given the size, profile and nature of the England job, though the pelters he still receives from some quarters is unfairly disproportionate. That was Twente's only title in nearly half a century of trying, after all. He also presented Middlesbrough with their first major trophy, the 2004 League Cup. And few outside Manchester now reference how he was Fergie's right-hand man when United landed their famous 1999 treble. That's not a half-bad CV, huh? And fair's fair, Croatia and Russia were decent enough in 2007.\n\nAlso rarely remembered these days is one of the greatest European runs in English football history: Middlesbrough's giddy romp to the 2006 Uefa Cup final. This involved not one, but two comebacks from three down, both performed within 21 days of each other. (So yes, they needed four goals on both occasions, thanks to the away goals rule, but we refer you again to our wholly arbitrary rules and regulations. Think of these as deluxe three-goal comebacks.)\n\nThe first came in the quarter-final against Basel, with Boro having lost the first leg at St Jakob-Park 2-0 and shipped a tap-in during the opening exchanges of the return. Three goals down, they set about the Swiss with three world-class strikes: a romp down the left channel by Mark Viduka followed by a shot into the top right; a delicate circumvention of goalkeeper Pascal Zuberb\u00fchler down the same channel by the same player; and a long-range whip into the top left past a flat-footed Zuberb\u00fchler by Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. The winner was the least spectacular of the lot, F\u00e1bio Rochemback's low fizzer parried by Zuberb\u00fchler, who then failed to stop Massimo Maccarone driving the rebound into the bottom right. Some top-notch talent there; the Uefa Cup wasn't always the second-rate shambles it is today.\n\nLightning doesn't strike twice, they say, but of course we all know it does. The semi-final against erstwhile European champions Steaua Bucharest looked all over when the Romanians, following up their 1-0 home leg victory, scored twice within the first 24 minutes of the return at the Riverside. Boro were three adrift again. And once more, they overhauled the deficit, Maccarone again the last-minute hero, planting home a header from Stewart Downing's left-wing cross. You couldn't script it. Well, you could, but you'd have trouble selling your work to a production company.\n\nLightning doesn't strike three times, they're right about that. Boro fell three behind again in the final, against Sevilla, and that one ended 4-0. Another futile effort, perhaps, though this one gave Boro fans some story to tell the grandkids. And it also earned McClaren the England job, which in terms of cause and effect led him to that Dutch title, best look at it that way.\n\n6) WEST BROMWICH ALBION 5-5 Manchester United (Premier League, 2013)\n\nAlex Ferguson only started winning league titles at Manchester United after his team embarked on a famous three-goal comeback. They were 3-0 down at Sheffield Wednesday on Boxing Day 1992, despite having dominated the match in terms of chances. With only 23 minutes left on the clock, Brian McClair converted a Lee Sharpe cross. On 80 minutes, Choccy repeated the trick, Sharpe performing a wonderful Cruyff Turn. On 83 minutes, Peter Schmeichel denied David Hirst, who had been put clean through by Chris Waddle. And a minute later, Eric Cantona scrambled another Sharpe cross home.\n\n\"We rode our luck,\" admitted Wednesday manager Trevor Francis. \"United were creating so many chances and not putting them away, it seemed they might never score. Once the first went in, it was obvious they would be back for more.\" (The wonder, again, that this sort of thing doesn't happen more often.) United had displayed a new-found grit and tenacity - this was one of the first famous Fergie comebacks - as well as sheer quality - it was Cantona's third game for his new club, and the first real sign that United had finally cracked the league-winning code. Their title credentials proven and belief bolstered, United would overhaul leaders Norwich City in the new year. That famous 26-year wait was over.\n\nSo it's with a pleasing symmetry that Fergie's valedictory match at the Hawthorns, 21 years later, ended with United shipping a three-goal lead. United, the new champions of England, were 5-2 up and coasting with nine minutes left to play. Five minutes later, Romelu Lukaku and Youssouf Mulumbu had shared three goals to haul the Baggies level. Ferguson had been denied what seemed certain victory in his 1,500th and final game in charge of United. A true genius, and yet the sport he had dominated for four decades insisted on having the last laugh, the final word. Hey, it happens to the best of them. The nearest football has ever got to DG Bradman, b Hollies, 0.\n\n* Thanks to Paul Doyle and Rob Smyth","1152":"The Masked Singer on FOX: Kitty 'to be unmasked' as actress - and it's not Sarah Hyland Kitty has had The Masked Singer fans guessing all series long, with theories ranging from the weird to the wonderful.

It may even shine a light on a part of their life that they had never seen before and it shows them in a whole new way, making this massive figure seem more human and down-to-earth.\n\nThe 1997 film Selena, however, was different. It felt more raw and personal -- and there's a reason for that: The idea was first pitched within a few weeks of her death, and it was released in theaters just before the second anniversary. The family saw how many unauthorized documentaries and articles were being produced about the events and wanted to set the record straight with their own project. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nIt's easy to praise an artist after their death when they've been put on a pedestal for the whole world to worship, even if they were misunderstood throughout their career. Everyone puts aside their wrongdoings and only focuses on the good. But when it comes to Selena Quintanilla, the pedestal placement was warranted. She was a trailblazer in many ways: for women in Tejano music (a male dominated genre), for Tejano music in the mainstream American market, and for Mexican-American women in general. She didn't have a lot growing up, but she had passion and talent, and she worked hard with the help of her family to make her dreams come true, that much is clear in the film.\n\nShe accomplished so much so young, even winning a Grammy Award in 1994. It makes you wonder how much she would have accomplished had she lived past the young age of 23, if she had the chance to really let her English crossover career happen. She could've been as big, if not bigger than crossover artists like Shakira and Ricky Martin, who both blew up in American later in the 1990s and 2000s. She had a likability -- in two languages, no less -- that was unparalleled, another reason why the film has stood the test of time.\n\nThe fact that her family was involved in the project right from the beginning makes it even more special. So many biographical films take huge liberties with the story of a beloved figure, but in Selena, we got to see all of her ups and downs, without focusing too much on her final days.\n\nThe most important thing about Selena is that it carries on her legacy. Many fans were barely alive when she was at her peak. Instead, we watched the movie, which was produced with so much love and appreciation for Selena, and it made us into fans, ensuring a whole new generation would carry on her incomparable spirit.\n\nOf course, you couldn't talk about this film without giving credit where credit is due. Jennifer Lopez, who was relatively unknown at the time, brought such a life to the character that nobody else could've accomplished. It was a career-making role for her, and one that even she has said has been a blessing to this day. She managed to capture the magic that Selena possessed and bring it to the big screen.\n\nThe creative decision to use Selena's actual singing voice and her original costumes made it feel like she was still there. The tribute at the end of the film, which shows a montage of real footage and a candlelight vigil with fans, while her song \"Dreaming of You\" plays is a powerful reminder of how many people Selena touched.\n\nThere are a million reasons why Selena is a masterpiece and why it deserves way more attention than it gets -- you could write 1000 words on the line \"Anything for Selenas!\" alone -- but what it all boils down to is that it keeps the one-of-a-kind spirit of Selena alive. We get to laugh with her, sing along to \"Como La Flor\" with her, feel scared with her, and so much more. For years to come, people will continue to celebrate her life and her accomplishments, and thanks to Selena, there will always be new fans to keep it going.","1155":"The Sun Sums Up the Star Wars Saga With 25 Pun Filled Front Pages The Sun is a daily tabloid published in the UK known for its sensational and sometimes punny headlines.

On the other hand, for approximately 100 human enzymes, no coding gene is known even though their enzymatic reaction has been well characterized. In this work, we assign one of those predicted membrane proteins (transmembrane protein 189; TMEM189) to one of the enzymatic reactions with an uncharacterized gene (plasmanylethanolamine desaturase). This enzyme catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of plasmalogens, an abundant class of glycerophospholipids that is depleted in such diseases as Alzheimer's. Our findings enable interpretation of the previously characterized impaired growth phenotype of Tmem189-deficient mice.\n\nA significant fraction of the glycerophospholipids in the human body is composed of plasmalogens, particularly in the brain, cardiac, and immune cell membranes. A decline in these lipids has been observed in such diseases as Alzheimer's and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Plasmalogens contain a characteristic 1-O-alk-1'-enyl ether (vinyl ether) double bond that confers special biophysical, biochemical, and chemical properties to these lipids. However, the genetics of their biosynthesis is not fully understood, since no gene has been identified that encodes plasmanylethanolamine desaturase (E.C. 1.14.99.19), the enzyme introducing the crucial alk-1'-enyl ether double bond. The present work identifies this gene as transmembrane protein 189 (TMEM189). Inactivation of the TMEM189 gene in human HAP1 cells led to a total loss of plasmanylethanolamine desaturase activity, strongly decreased plasmalogen levels, and accumulation of plasmanylethanolamine substrates and resulted in an inability of these cells to form labeled plasmalogens from labeled alkylglycerols. Transient expression of TMEM189 protein, but not of other selected desaturases, recovered this deficit. TMEM189 proteins contain a conserved protein motif (pfam10520) with eight conserved histidines that is shared by an alternative type of plant desaturase but not by other mammalian proteins. Each of these histidines is essential for plasmanylethanolamine desaturase activity. Mice homozygous for an inactivated Tmem189 gene lacked plasmanylethanolamine desaturase activity and had dramatically lowered plasmalogen levels in their tissues. These results assign the TMEM189 gene to plasmanylethanolamine desaturase and suggest that the previously characterized phenotype of Tmem189-deficient mice may be caused by a lack of plasmalogens.","1157":"The Taliban, my sister, and my kitchen-table bootcamp business People quote a range of reasons for deciding to strike out on their own in business, but I haven't yet met anyone else who can cite both the Taliban and their sister as their inspiration.\n\nLet me explain. I had been in the Royal Marines for 11 years when I came very close to meeting my maker.\n\nIn 2007 I was in Afghanistan trying to defend Kajaki dam in Helmand province. The aim was for Nato to keep the hydro-dam running as it supplied electricity to the local population.\n\nThe Taliban were not happy about this and were trying to take the hydro-dam back, and one day I managed to get myself blown up by a rocket-propelled grenade.\n\nI was flown back home to have the shrapnel removed and while that was successful, my hearing suffered significant damage. There was hope it might repair itself, so while we waited to find out the Marines employed me to train recruits.\n\nAfter two years my hearing had not improved and I was told I would lose it altogether if I returned to the front line.\n\nDuring this period my sister, Emma, asked me to get her in shape. After a few sessions and good results, she suggested that if I turned it into a product I could be on to something. And that is when the idea for my business, Go Commando Bootcamp, which offers military-based fitness programmes and sessions, started to take seed.\n\nTo be honest, I didn't have much of a clue about business, so I started small. I rang the council, asked if I could use a park for training, and then publicised the event through Facebook, posters and a banner at the park, while telling as many people as I could. The Marines were great - they put me to work part-time in a careers office in Leicester so I'd still have some income while I got the business off the ground.\n\nI had no idea how many people would turn up. The first session attracted 15 people but by the end of the first month we were getting 70. Now, five years on, we have five locations, 12 instructors, three administrators and four Go Commando vans.\n\nMine was a classic kitchen table startup, operating all administrative tasks from my house. But although the business was growing I wasn't happy - I had gone from the Marines with constant camaraderie, to working by myself. Frankly, I did not enjoy it.\n\nSo I looked around for somewhere; I heard about the Rural Innovation Centre at Stoneleigh Park in Warwickshire - funded by Defra and Warwickshire County Council - and I took on offices there. I chose the centre because I have a dog and wanted to bring him to work; I wanted somewhere I could go for a run; and I needed an office that gave me the flexibility to expand as the business grew.\n\nI have used my links with the resettlement officers in the Marines, and leavers who express an interest in fitness training are sent to us, trained and then set up sessions in their local areas. This approach means we will soon be operating in Manchester, Northampton and Barnstaple.\n\nThe hardest thing for me is a lack of training in business management, marketing and HR. It is fine to have a business idea but at the end of the day there are essentials you need to know, whatever your business.\n\nLee Stuart is the founder of Go Commando Bootcamp\n\nSign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.","1158":"The Utter Weirdness of Small Talk in a Pandemic Pleasantries amid a global health crisis are woefully insufficient. They are also what we have.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, the actor Katey Sagal -- star of Married ... With Children and Sons of Anarchy -- sent a very simple tweet to her half-million followers: \"Checking in with everyone. How are you doing?\"\n\nThe replies to her question were revealing. \"Scared, anxious, stressed coated in a thin layer of hope,\" went one. \"Doing fine \ud83d\ude0ahoping that this nightmare will be over soon though,\" went another. One person mentioned that they were coping by watching Sons of Anarchy. Another mentioned that they were getting through by eating ice cream. (What kind? Sagal asked. Rocky Road, came the reply.) There were also less-cheerful responses. \"Terrible,\" one person wrote. \"I'm an unemployed bartender. Never been unemployed in my life. I couldn't be more terrified.\" Another responded: \"Hanging in there. Working from home until mid April. Mom is under Hospice care at her nursing home and, as of today, we can no longer visit. That really kills me.\"\n\nIn some ways, those answers merely reveal the intimacy of celebrity in the age of social media. But they also suggest a much more specific state of affairs, as the COVID-19 pandemic hits the United States: Sagal's simple question elicited answers of hope, of chaos, of fear, of heartbreak, of resilience. In ordinary times, \"How are you doing?\" and \"How are you?\" are polite but perfunctory: They are questions that aren't really questions, though they might yield answers (the equally dutiful \"I'm fine, thanks\"). Just as in other languages -- \u00bfC\u00f3mo est\u00e1s? \u00c7a va? N\u012d h\u0103o -- the query is generally a simple greeting. I've occasionally made the mistake of taking it literally -- when I'm not fine, saying so -- and each time I've been made to remember that the honesty was a breach of etiquette. In ordinary times, people don't ask \"How are you?\" because they want a real answer; they ask it because asking is what you do.\n\nRead: The best kind of food to cook during a pandemic\n\nBut these, of course, are not ordinary times. People are dying of a new and not fully understood illness. Many of those who are fortunate enough to be healthy are sequestered in their home, for a period that might be days or weeks but might also be months. And many, at the same time, are anxious and bored and underemployed and overemployed and stir-crazy and uncertain and lonely and terrified. Our context, at the moment, is crisis. And that fact alone brings a new meaning -- and a new weight -- to even the most banal of our pleasantries. I mention Sagal's tweet because it neatly encapsulates what I've seen in my own life, over the past weeks: When people ask \"How are you?\" these days, they tend to mean it literally -- and tend to receive honest answers. One very small consequence of COVID-19 is that it is turning \"How are you?\" into a question again.\n\nIn an apocalypse, the movies suggest, politeness is one of the first things to go. Manners, teetering as they do at the tippy-top of Maslow's hierarchy, finally topple. The thin veneer of civilization peels and cracks, the self-interest takes over, and Darwinism reasserts its dull demands. The COVID-19 pandemic is not yet apocalyptic in the U.S. But the crisis, so far, has nevertheless been something of a rebuke to Hollywood: The pandemic has brought out human selfishness, yes, but it has also brought out human kindness. It has illustrated the deep interconnections among people -- how profoundly interdependent we are, and how thoroughly we need one another. Humans are social animals, the biologists and psychologists are always saying. A pandemic is, on top of everything else, a sobering reminder of that.\n\nBut our language lags. American pleasantries, pretty much by definition, are pleasant. They are not well equipped to account for our tragedies. They are very good at softening the world's rough edges. They are very good at finding small sites of communion, and at establishing minor vectors of empathy (\"Such beautiful weather we're having!\"; \"Did you watch the Nats last night?\"). They are very good at narrowing the world. But they are distinctly less good at expanding it. When I ask someone \"How are you?\" these days, what I really mean is this: \"How are you, health-wise? How are you, otherwise? How is your family? How are you coping? Are you coping? Have you been washing your hands? Do you have enough beans? Are you bored? Are you scared? Me, too.\"\n\nWhat I end up doing, though, is a version of what Katey Sagal did, when she asked her followers not just \"How are you?\" but instead the longer form of the query: \"How are you doing?\" I try to find ways -- linguistic hacks, really -- to emphasize that I don't mean the inquiry in the typical, perfunctory way, but instead in a way that is calibrated to this terrible moment: No, really, how are you? I find myself doing the same thing a lot of people have been doing with me: modifying the standard question to make clear that it really is a question. How are you ... considering? How are you doing ... with all this?\n\nAnd I try to do the same with my answers, too. \"I'm fine,\" at the moment, is not merely insufficient; it is a lie. And, so, I turn to a modifier for help. \"I'm okay, considering.\" \"I'm okay, given [gestures sadly at the world].\" \"I'm okay, all in all.\" These replies are not graceful or specific, but at least they are honest. I really am doing okay in the scheme of things, for now -- I'm healthy and employed and at home with people I love -- but I'm also very much not doing okay. Because no one, right now, is doing okay.\n\nAmericans have a well-known bias toward optimism -- the journalist Barbara Ehrenreich wrote a book on that subject -- and it is a habit of mind so deeply ingrained that it is present at the basic level of language. Pleasantries themselves are optimistic things; they insist on seeing the bright side of any situation. They look at the rainy weather and note that it's supposed to clear up by the weekend. They argue, cheerfully, that the Nats could be on their way to another World Series win. They ask \"How are you?\" and expect that the answer will be, automatically, \"I'm fine, thanks.\"\n\nThis is not, however, a moment of \"I'm fine, thanks.\" This is not a moment for the perfunctory or the superficially polite. It is a moment in which the best way to be polite -- to be courteous, to be caring, to be well mannered -- is to shed some of the traditional courtesies. Unvarnished honesty is its own form of politeness. Here are some of the posts you might find if you search for the phrase \"I'm doing fine\" on Twitter. \"I think I'm doing fine, but I also just ran an empty microwave for three minutes with a bowl of food next to it.\" \"Friend: How are you? Me: I'm doing fine! How I'm actually feeling: [an animated GIF of a boy sobbing].\" \"Goooooood morning! This is fine, I'm doing fine. [an image of a banana in a microwave].\" \"I'm doing fine but i'm not okay.\"\n\nThat last one got more than 2,400 likes. Little wonder: It is a fitting refrain for this moment. Fine, right now, is not fine at all. Pleasantries don't work well during a time when so little is pleasant. But they're what we have. \"Hope you're well,\" I'll sign my emails, still, and the 3.5 words may be the same as they were before, but they are different. I mean them differently. I mean them more sincerely. And here's something else I really do mean: I hope you're well, too.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

Consequently, many investors track the so-called technical trading indicators (geometric patterns constructed from historical prices and trading volumes) in order to understand and predict Bitcoin's future movement.\n\nSome researchers have found success with large complicated models. But these sometimes have hundreds of variables (or predictors) and it is difficult to determine key factors or test the replicability of such approaches. It's also hard to understand what factors really drive Bitcoin fluctuations on the market.\n\nFor over 20 years, I have been researching the applications of AI in finance. At the Lang School of Business and Economics at the University of Guelph, my co-author and former graduate student Robert Adcock and I created an artificial neural network (ANN) model to test the predictability of Bitcoin prices.\n\nPredicting fluctuations\n\nWe used technical indicators called moving averages as predictors. Moving averages are constructed by averaging prices over a period of time (e.g. 50 or 200 days) and plotting them as a line along with the prices. The rationale for using moving averages is that if the price of Bitcoin today becomes greater or lower than the average price over the past 50 or 200 days, traders could expect the emergence of an upward or downward trend.\n\nIf Bitcoin is unpredictable, then our model is not expected to beat the random walk model -- essentially, it is no better than guessing.\n\nHowever, our model provided some very interesting results regarding Bitcoin's predictability over time and during bouts of unusual volatility.\n\nArtificial intelligence forecasts\n\nUsing daily observations from 2011-2018, we created an ANN with three predictors: returns, 50-day buy-sell signal and 200-day buy-sell signal.\n\nWe also tested an ANN model that included the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) to see if stock market volatility had any noticeable effect on Bitcoin movements. The VIX is an index providing theoretical 30-day market expectations as based on the S&P 500 Index. Higher values of VIX indicate that the market will make a large swing.\n\nArtificial neural networks operate in a similar way to the basic functioning of the human brain. Our model takes predictors, or inputs, and outputs (the daily price change of Bitcoin) and attempts to learn a pattern from all the data. It continues to test its patterns until it reaches an optimal point where further testing is redundant. These advanced models form the backbone of many AI learning programs that are used in business and engineering.\n\nBy combining Bitcoin technical analysis and neural networks, we hoped that the ANN would find a pattern among the data that allowed us to more accurately predict future returns.\n\nNon-traditional investors\n\nOur ANN model did indeed succeed in reducing the prediction error of the random walk by about five to 10 per cent over the full observation period. These forecast improvements are statistically significant, indicating that predicting Bitcoin prices on a daily basis is no longer guesswork. Our results show that Bitcoin is unaffected by how the stock market changes, which suggests that traditional market investors and investors in Bitcoin are two distinct groups.\n\nWe also separated the data into four subsamples of similar time frames to further zoom in on market inefficiencies. Our ANN's predictive performance improved further within these subsamples.\n\nOne subsample, running from October 2014 to June 2016, provided the best results of the study. The isolated 200-day signal model outperformed the random walk by 43.55 per cent. We noted that this subsample had low volatility compared to the other three subsamples and was the steadiest period of data we observed. In essence, greater market volatility makes learning data patterns and training of the ANN model more difficult.\n\nAlong with price accuracy, we also observed how often our ANN models correctly predicted whether prices would increase or decrease. Our main comprehensive model over the entire 2011-2018 period had nearly 63 per cent prediction accuracy. Put differently, Bitcoin trading with our model would be on average more profitable than placing random buy and sell orders that have a 50 per cent chance of making a profit.\n\nSpeculation and predictive bubbles\n\nCompared to other predictive models, our ANN provided the most accurate and reliable predictive method for Bitcoin. We concluded that the historical evolution of daily Bitcoin prices followed predictive trends (or bubbles) that potentially arise from the speculative nature of cryptocurrency trading.\n\nRead more: How low will Bitcoin now go? The history of price bubbles provides some clues\n\nWe believe that the future of forecasting Bitcoin -- and perhaps investing in general -- lies in the abilities of artificial intelligence and artificial neural networks. While people may argue over the merits of Bitcoin as a currency, we can at least appreciate it as a fascinating -- and now easier-to-predict -- commodity.","1161":"The best books to read in self-isolation I would like to receive trends and interviews from fashion, lifestyle to travel every week, by email\n\nYou've consumed the bestsellers and have the year's cult releases on your Amazon pre-order list.\n\nSo what to read now?

It is without fail the funniest book I have ever read -- I even cuddled it in my sleep I was so attached to it -- and manages to make you chuckle with laughter whilst crying at the most tender, human moments. It's original, at points surreal and at points uproarious, and if ever you needed a comfort read, this book is it.'\n\n'It's a memoir of survival and a celebration of love, care, and all the things -- life and art and books -- that persist despite illness.'\n\n'This razor-sharp polemic exploring class, taste and culture, is one of the most insightful analyses of the British class system I've read in years.'\n\n'I have dozens of pristine cookbooks taunting me from my kitchen; now I actually have time to open them. There's something soothing about reading a cookbook cover to cover.

We encounter all the shape-shifting forms of eros: romantic, parental, filial and friend-love. 'I have nothing but sympathy for how people behave,' says Garp, in one of his many almost-wise moments, 'and nothing but laughter with which to console them.' The book is full of false endings because it tells us that life can be long; there is often more down the line, and even after the most apocalyptic moments in our personal histories we will probably have to live on a bit more.

For more quality articles about all things PC gaming, you can subscribe now in the UK and the US.\n\nWelcome to the history of Civilization, a series that has been keeping us up until silly o'clock in the morning since the release of Sid Meier's original game in September 1991. Civ turns all of human history into a playground that you can exploit, turn by turn, to bring your chosen nation to glory. It's a fascinating series because it has been interpreted by a new lead designer in each iteration, including Alpha Centauri's Brian Reynolds, Mohawk Games' Soren Johnson, and of course Sid Meier himself. In the following pages we talk to all of them about how the series has evolved from Civilization through to Civilization VI.\n\n\"We were young, and we had no fear\"\n\nIn 1991, MicroProse launched Sid Meier's Civilization, a game that would define turn-based strategy for over two decades, and give birth to a genre that eventually became known as 4X: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate. You probably know someone who has been struck down by One More Turn Syndrome, shackled to their PC at 3am. Maybe it's you. Meier had no idea what he was starting.\n\nMeier and Bruce Shelley had finished Railroad Tycoon and were looking for another project. They wanted to expand on some of the ideas behind their last game, and Meier had been intrigued by the exploration system found in Empire, the turn-based wargame. It started by giving players a limited view of the world, but that viewpoint gradually unfurled as the world was explored.\n\n\"Railroad Tycoon had this sense of being a large-scale game,\" Meier recalls. \"But we were bold and wondered what's a bigger, more epic thing we can do? Well, how about the history of civilisation? We were young, and we had no fear.\"\n\nIt was easier to be fearless then. \"The expectations in terms of graphics and team size were different in those days. We did the first half of the work on Civ with just Bruce and I, so we could try things with less risk. It was definitely not something we knew was going to work, but it looked like it would be fun to try.\"\n\nWhile other strategy games were offering up cities or companies as playgrounds, Meier did worry that what they were creating was going to be too much. Too daunting. How do you make a game that spans human history? To start with, they said no to hexes, which wouldn't make it into the series until Civilization V.\n\n\"One of the reasons we used squares for mapping was we thought hexes were too geeky. We went with squares to make things accessible.\"\n\nMaking Civilization turn-based was an accessibility decision, too. Meier considered creating an RTS, but after testing it, he realised that it didn't give players enough time to get to grips with its myriad systems. \"Development is a journey in itself, and it could have easily gone in different directions. There were a number of things we considered that we didn't end up doing. Real-time is one of them. I think it's great to look at Age of Empires, for example, because that's how the game would have probably progressed if we'd continued down that route.\"\n\nDespite being a game of conquest, there's always been a thread of optimism running through the series, and it's not an accident. It was part of MicroProse's philosophy. It wasn't all murder and land-grabbing. \"It revolved around what's the most fun. We were criticised for not including slavery in both Civ and Pirates, for instance, but those were decisions based on what makes a satisfying and pleasant experience for the players.\"\n\nEveryone who's played Civ knows that Montezuma's a dick, and for each leader, there are personality traits attributed to them. But while later iterations emphasised that, those AI personalities were basic in the first game. \"Players would read more into the game then what was there in some cases,\" Meier laughs.\n\nSome leaders might be more aggressive than others, and they were affected by player interactions, but it wasn't quite as elaborate as the stories told by players implied. It helps, Meier thinks, that each leader and civilisation was recognisable. Players knew what to expect.\n\n\"One of the reasons Civ was successful was it tapped into things you already knew. You can enter into this world which you already know. You might know Napoleon, and Gandhi has a clear personality; these are leaders who you've probably heard of and already associate a personality or feeling with.\"\n\nThat success wasn't a given, though, and Meier only realised quite how special Civilization was after seeing other people playing it. \"As other people played it in the company, we'd hear, 'Just one more turn,' and, 'I can't stop playing.' Whether the world was ready for it or not, we weren't sure, but as the game launched and we started to get feedback, it gained momentum. We sensed that something unique was happening.","1164":"The digital economy is becoming ordinary. Best we understand it The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations\n\nThe digital economy has been getting a lot of attention, with increasingly strong headlines offering apocalyptic as well as breathtakingly exciting scenarios. Some warn of job losses due to automation, some wonder at the things digital technology can do. And then there's real scepticism about whether this will translate into delivering to people who need it most.\n\nWith all of this discussion, however, there is seldom an explanation of what the digital economy actually is. What makes it different from the traditional economy? Why we should care about it?\n\nThe digital economy is a term that captures the impact of digital technology on patterns of production and consumption. This includes how goods and services are marketed, traded and paid for.\n\nThe term evolved from the 1990s, when the focus was on the impact of the internet on the economy. This was extended to include the emergence of new types of digitally-oriented firms and the production of new technologies.\n\nToday the term encompasses a dizzying array of technologies and their application. This includes artificial intelligence, the internet of things, augmented and virtual reality, cloud computing, blockchain, robotics and autonomous vehicles.\n\nThe digital economy is now recognised to include all parts of the economy that exploit technological change that leads to markets, business models and day-to-day operations being transformed. So it covers everything from traditional technology, media and telecoms sectors through to new digital sectors. These include e-commerce, digital banking, and even \"traditional\" sectors like agriculture or mining or manufacturing that are being affected by the application of emerging technologies.\n\nUnderstanding these dynamics has become non-negotiable. The digital economy will, soon, become the ordinary economy as the uptake - and application - of digital technologies in every sector in the world grows.\n\nI have been part of a team of researchers looking at what this means for a society like South Africa. In particular, we have been focused on looking at what the proliferation of the digital economy means for inclusion - making sure that everyone can access it - and economic opportunities.\n\nBut the first step was to get absolutely clarity on what this multifaceted phenomenon is.\n\nThe digital core\n\nAt the centre of the digital economy is a 'digital core'. This includes the providers of physical technologies like semiconductors and processors, the devices they enable like computers and smartphones, the software and algorithms which run on them, and the enabling infrastructure these devices use like the internet and telecoms networks.\n\nThis is followed by 'digital providers'. These are the parties that use these technologies to provide digital products and services like mobile payments, e-commerce platforms or machine learning solutions.\n\nLastly, there are the 'digital applications'. This covers organisations that use the products and services of digital providers to transform the way they go about their business. Examples include virtual banks, digital media, and e-government services.\n\nA concrete example helps paint the pictures. Consider a typical agriculture value chain: a smallholder farmer needs inputs (like financing) to produce and then sell crops to, say, processors or directly to consumers. Today smallholders can obtain financing through their mobile phones from digital financial services providers rather than physically visiting a bank. These digital financial services are able to assess the risk of lending to the farmer by building a profile using AI algorithms in conjunction with alternative data sets, such as mobile phone usage or satellite farm imagery.\n\nThen there are the mobile applications that can help farmers produce better crops. They can provide advice on the best time for planting, soil quality and dealing with pests. It means that a farmer no longer has to rely on face-to-face advice from friends or agro-dealers.\n\nAnother example in the agriculture arena is the ability of farmers to rent tractors. Known as asset-sharing platforms, these enable farmers to gain access to a tractor they wouldn't ordinarily be able to afford.\n\nDigital versus traditional\n\nSo what makes the digital economy different to the traditional economy?\n\nFirstly, digital technologies allow firms to do their business differently as well as more efficiently and cost-effectively. They also open up a host of new possibilities. Take navigation apps. No team of people would ever be able to provide real time, traffic-aware navigation in the way that smartphone apps do.\n\nThis means that products and services can be offered to more consumers, particularly those who couldn't be served before.\n\nSecondly, these effects are giving rise to entirely new market structures that remove, among other things, transaction costs in traditional markets. The best example of this is the rise of digital platforms such as Amazon, Uber and Airbnb. These companies connect market participants together in a virtual world. They reveal optimal prices and generate trust between strangers in new ways.\n\nLastly, the digital economy is fuelled by - and generates - enormous amounts of data. Traditionally when we made purchases in a brick-and-mortar store using cash, no-one was keeping an account of our personal consumption or financial transactions on a large scale. Now, ordering online and paying electronically means that many of our consumption and financial transactions generate electronic data which is recorded and held by someone.\n\nThe collation and analysis of this data provides enormous opportunities - and risks - to transform how a range of economic activities are performed.\n\nThe digital economy is with us. Yet the boundaries between digital and traditional are blurring as technological change permeates every facet of of modern life. We all need to understand the nature of this change to be able to respond at every level: society, corporate and personal.\n\nThe South Africa in the Digital Age initiative has been convened by Genesis Analytics in partnership with the Gordon Institute of Business Science and the Pathways for Prosperity Commission at Oxford University. A multi-stakeholder initiative, it has developed a forward-looking digital economy strategy for the country.","1165":"The distribution and magnitude of subglacial erosion on millennial timescales at Engabreen, Norway | Annals of Glaciology | Cambridge Core We quantify the magnitude of millennial-scale glacial erosion at Engabreen, a temperate glacier in coastal northern Norway, using the in situ cosmogenic nuclides carbon-14 (14C) and beryllium-10 (10Be) in bedrock exposed recently by glacial retreat. Nuclide concentrations show no dependence on distance down or across the valley. As such, resulting Holocene erosion depths along two transects perpendicular to glacier flow are highly variable with no systematic distribution, ranging from 0.10 to 2.95 m. We observed 14C-10Be ratios elevated above the production ratio in samples of abraded bedrock, which is counter to the expectation for surfaces covered during the Holocene and exposed only recently. Muon reactions produce nuclides at greater depths than do spallation reactions and 14C at production rates at higher than those of 10Be, resulting in 14C-10Be ratios that increase with depth. Therefore, elevated 14C-10Be ratios indicate that sampled sites were deeply plucked during recent cover, the Little Ice Age in this case, and then rapidly abraded prior to retreat. Our results suggest that, while glacial erosion can generate a u-shaped valley profile over long periods of time (e.g., 105-107 years), the discontinuous nature of glacial plucking produces spatially variable patterns of erosion over shorter millennial timescales.","1166":"The effects of evolutionary adaptations on spreading processes in complex networks This article requires a subscription to view the full text.

Access to this article can also be purchased.\n\nIn this article, we bridge the disconnect between how spreading processes propagate and evolve in real life and the current mathematical and simulation models that ignore evolutionary adaptations. We propose a mathematical theory that reveals the effects of evolutionary adaptations on spreading processes in complex networks and highlights the shortcomings of classical epidemic models that do not capture evolution. Our work provides substantive developments to the classical theory of network epidemics and paves the way for exploring depths and revealing insights on the emergence phenomenon.","1167":"The experts' step-by-step guide to cyber security With hacking such a widespread problem in the small business community, we pinpoint the best advice from our live Q&A to help you avoid a breach\n\nWhere does cyber security fall on your to-do list? If it's not a priority, it should be because 60% of small businesses suffered a breach in the year leading up to October 2014. The worst of these breaches disrupted operations for an average of seven to 10 days.\n\nWe recently held a live Q&A on the topic, with a panel of experts on hand to answer your questions. From risk assessment to keeping your business safe on a budget, here are some of their suggestions:\n\nWhere can I educate myself about cyber security?\n\nNot all small firms will have the budget to outsource their online security. The panelists pointed out that it is possible to get advice for free:\n\nThe IASME website has a list of sites offering free help The government recently published a free guide on cyber security A free Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) developed by FutureLearn, which is owned by The Open University, offers an introduction to cyber security What risk assessments should I carry out?\n\nThe most important thing is to make sure you understand what data and information you hold. \"What are the crown jewels within the business?\" asks Del Heppenstall, who leads KPMG's cyber security teams across the southern and midlands regions. \"These could be IP, financial, customer details, employee records - once you have a handle on what it is that is important to your business and where you store this data, then you can begin to assess the threats and risks that these information assets will be open to.\"\n\nBusiness owners should also take a look at their digital assets, such as domain names and trademarks, and ensure they have \"secured all of your brand names with more common domain suffixes\", says Stuart Fuller, director of commercial operations and communications at NetNames. \"You can also see if any third parties have registered domain names using your business trademark or brands that could be taking away website visitors (and potential revenue).\"\n\nYou can do a simple domain name search using www.who.is, to see if domain names are registered.\n\nHow can SMEs instil a culture of information security in the workplace?\n\nIt just takes one person clicking on a dodgy link to put an entire enterprise at risk. Training staff to follow cyber security procedures could save you a lot of time and money in the long run. Emma Philpott, CEO of the IASME Consortium Ltd, suggests the following:\n\nInclude cyber security elements in staff contracts Implement training for staff about the basic controls and why they need them Hold regular discussions about what the threats and risks might be and how these change over time\n\nOther suggestions included launching a safe phishing campaign to track improvements following training and developing an acceptable use policy.\n\nShould small businesses dissuade staff from bringing in their own devices to work (BYOD)?\n\nAllowing staff to bring their own devices to work is often more affordable than buying company equipment, but businesses need to have a BYOD policy. As a minimum, devices should have anti-malware on them and be regularly patched, says Philpott. \"Ideally they would also be encrypted, capable of being tracked and remotely wiped but then there may be issues about who owns the data.\"\n\nYou should plan ahead for if a device goes missing. Stephen Hind, who provides cloud solutions consultation and implementation for DrPete, says: \"All the big cloud providers offer mobile device management so if a device does go missing the company can wipe the account from the device. If you cannot do this you need to ask yourself the question of how you would cope in that scenario.\"\n\nThere are other ways that risks can be mitigated. Dr Stephen Moody, solutions director for EMEA at ThreatMatrix, says: \"If, for example, users are connecting to business assets through a web portal then services can be run when users connect to check for malware on the machine and also provide additional frictionless authentication protection (if, for example, a fraudster has gained access to a staff username and password). This doesn't require anything to be installed on the user's device.\"\n\nWhat's the best way to make sure that remote workers do what they can to avoid a breach?\n\nWith more businesses offering staff the option of home and remote working, avoiding a breach can seem out of your control. Panelists suggested activating a two-step verification process to sign in so users do not rely on a \"static password\".\n\nRemote workers should also be aware of who is working around them in a public space. Privacy screens can help shield your computer from prying eyes. Users should also be aware of the public spaces they use to operate online, specifically using open Wi-Fi connections.\n\nSign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network here for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox."}}
